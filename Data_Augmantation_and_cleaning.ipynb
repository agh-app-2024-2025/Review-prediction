            "Translation failed for: I read this when it was first published, ordering it before I knew it was YA, and years before any films (which I've not seen). If I were a teenager or recommending this to a teen, I might give it 3*; as an adult, I give it 2*.PLOTIt's a potentially exciting but gruesome story, but most of the characters were rather flat, and much of the plot was predictable, partly because it's not hugely original. See Shirley Jackson'sThe Lottery, which I reviewedHERE, and the JapaneseBattle Royale. Furthermore, there were too many flaws in the plot. I fail to understand its very high ratings.Post-apocalyptic America (Panem) is divided into a wealthy and technologically advanced Capitol and twelve subsidiary districts of oppressed people who exist in dire poverty, with inadequate food, housing, and health care and hardly any technology. To reinforce the power of the Capitol by instilling fear in the population, once a year, two children from each region are selected by lots to fight to the death in a reality show. If that were not bad enough, the whole thing is utterly corrupt in multiple ways, plus the public bet on the outcome, and sponsors can sway the results. Did I mention these arechildren? (Some are as young as 12, though the narrator is 16.) A compulsory full-body wax on a teen seems rather pervy and who would want to bet on, let alone sponsor a child-killing tournament, even if it's by helping one of the contestants? As the book keeps reminding readers, one person's survival is only possible by the death ofallthe others.CRUELTY TO CHILDRENI realise that horrendous things are done to children around the world every day (extreme poverty, child soldiers, sexual assault, genital mutilation etc), but in none of those cases is thesole intentionthatallbut one child dies, and nor is it organised by thegovernmentfor a sick combination of sport, entertainment, punishment and profit.Humans often lack compassion, but I was never convinced by Collins' world - especially the fact this outrage has continued forthree generations(it's the 74th games), apparently without the Capitol even needing to invoke gods or supernatural powers to justify their cruelty! Could a barbaric annual tournament really be such a powerful incentive not to rise up in all that time? (I don't think so.)BIG ISSUESNevertheless, it tackles some big themes that are particularly pertinent to teens: the nature of friendship; divided loyalties; the difference between love and friendship; who to trust; whether the ends justify the means; the need to repay favours; the danger of power, wealth and celebrity; the corrupting influence of reality TV; the need for independence, and whether you can trust a parent who abandons you.It all feels rather laboured to me, but it might not if I were a teen, which only reinforces my puzzlement at the number of adults who have enjoyed it. I must be missing something.NARRATIVE STRUCTURENearly half the book is backstory and preparation for the games; the remainder is a tale of hunter and hunted. I predicted the main plot twist less than a quarter of the way in (and the fact that Katniss is telling the story limits the possible outcomes), but the suspense was broken when it was made explicit way before the end. There are some other twists between then and the final page, but by then I was rather annoyed with the whole thing.IMPLAUSIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCIESIfI'd enjoyed the book more, I would have found it easier to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, I was constantly irked by questions and inconsistencies.* The contestants (and their parents and grandparents) have been forced to watch the games every year of their lives. I suppose they had become inured to it, but on the other hand, that meant theyknewthe horror of it. I just didn't believe there was as little fear in them as there appeared to be - given that they are children.* Participants don't want other participants to know where they are, yet sponsor gifts occasionally drop out of the sky, via silver parachute; not a risk, apparently.* It's all filmed by numerous invisible floating cameras (I can buy that), but that somehow includes filming inside a cave that is virtually sealed (I can't).* How (and why) would any of these participants be able to measure time to within half hour intervals?* How big is Panem? It can only be a tiny part of the USA because each district specialises in only one thing (coal mining, agriculture etc) and has just one town square that can accommodate everyone (8,000 people in District 12) and yet it's a day's train journey from District 12 to the Capitol. It doesn't seem like a very plausible settlement pattern in a post-disaster world, even given the totalitarian regime (concentrating people in a few centres makes it easier to observe and perhaps control them, but it also creates more opportunities for opposition movements to develop).COMPARED WITH LORD OF THE FLIESThere are some similarities with \"Lord of the Flies\" (my review here:http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...), but although \"The Hunger Games\" is likely to have more appeal to modern teens, I think there are (at least) two crucial differences:* In LotF one person's survival is not necessarily at the cost of everyone else's. (It is even possible that they could all survive.)* LotF has much more depth and symbolism: it tackles original sin; the mystical \"Beast\"; leadership, tribal allegiance and group dynamics (including bullying and attitudes to difference and minor disability) and the importance of ritual and belief.The second point is what makes LotF a better book, in my opinion.Of course, there are other, more obvious, parallels with extreme \"reality\" shows such as \"Survivor\" and \"I'm a Celebrity, get me out of here\", but the fundamental differences are not just that contestants in those shows do not fear for their lives, but that they are adults who havechosento enter.I TRIED TO ENJOY IT!Any fans who read this will now hate me. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I read it all the way through, making notes as usual, but to no avail. Sorry., error: I read this when it was first published, ordering it before I knew it was YA, and years before any films (which I've not seen).

See Shirley Jackson'sThe Lottery, which I reviewedHERE, and the JapaneseBattle Royale. Furthermore, there were too many flaws in the plot. I fail to understand its very high ratings.Post-apocalyptic America (Panem) is divided into a wealthy and technologically advanced Capitol and twelve subsidiary districts of oppressed people who exist in dire poverty, with inadequate food, housing, and health care and hardly any technology. To reinforce the power of the Capitol by instilling fear in the population, once a year, two children from each region are selected by lots to fight to the death in a reality show. If that were not bad enough, the whole thing is utterly corrupt in multiple ways, plus the public bet on the outcome, and sponsors can sway the results. Did I mention these arechildren? (Some are as young as 12, though the narrator is 16.) A compulsory full-body wax on a teen seems rather pervy and who would want to bet on, let alone sponsor a child-killing tournament, even if it's by helping one of the contestants? As the book keeps reminding readers, one person's survival is only possible by the death ofallthe others.CRUELTY TO CHILDRENI realise that horrendous things are done to children around the world every day (extreme poverty, child soldiers, sexual assault, genital mutilation etc), but in none of those cases is thesole intentionthatallbut one child dies, and nor is it organised by thegovernmentfor a sick combination of sport, entertainment, punishment and profit.Humans often lack compassion, but I was never convinced by Collins' world - especially the fact this outrage has continued forthree generations(it's the 74th games), apparently without the Capitol even needing to invoke gods or supernatural powers to justify their cruelty! Could a barbaric annual tournament really be such a powerful incentive not to rise up in all that time? (I don't think so.)BIG ISSUESNevertheless, it tackles some big themes that are particularly pertinent to teens: the nature of friendship; divided loyalties; the difference between love and friendship; who to trust; whether the ends justify the means; the need to repay favours; the danger of power, wealth and celebrity; the corrupting influence of reality TV; the need for independence, and whether you can trust a parent who abandons you.It all feels rather laboured to me, but it might not if I were a teen, which only reinforces my puzzlement at the number of adults who have enjoyed it. I must be missing something.NARRATIVE STRUCTURENearly half the book is backstory and preparation for the games; the remainder is a tale of hunter and hunted. I predicted the main plot twist less than a quarter of the way in (and the fact that Katniss is telling the story limits the possible outcomes), but the suspense was broken when it was made explicit way before the end. There are some other twists between then and the final page, but by then I was rather annoyed with the whole thing.IMPLAUSIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCIESIfI'd enjoyed the book more, I would have found it easier to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, I was constantly irked by questions and inconsistencies.* The contestants (and their parents and grandparents) have been forced to watch the games every year of their lives. I suppose they had become inured to it, but on the other hand, that meant theyknewthe horror of it. I just didn't believe there was as little fear in them as there appeared to be - given that they are children.* Participants don't want other participants to know where they are, yet sponsor gifts occasionally drop out of the sky, via silver parachute; not a risk, apparently.* It's all filmed by numerous invisible floating cameras (I can buy that), but that somehow includes filming inside a cave that is virtually sealed (I can't).* How (and why) would any of these participants be able to measure time to within half hour intervals?* How big is Panem? It can only be a tiny part of the USA because each district specialises in only one thing (coal mining, agriculture etc) and has just one town square that can accommodate everyone (8,000 people in District 12) and yet it's a day's train journey from District 12 to the Capitol. It doesn't seem like a very plausible settlement pattern in a post-disaster world, even given the totalitarian regime (concentrating people in a few centres makes it easier to observe and perhaps control them, but it also creates more opportunities for opposition movements to develop).COMPARED WITH LORD OF THE FLIESThere are some similarities with \"Lord of the Flies\" (my review here:http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...), but although \"The Hunger Games\" is likely to have more appeal to modern teens, I think there are (at least) two crucial differences:* In LotF one person's survival is not necessarily at the cost of everyone else's. (It is even possible that they could all survive.)* LotF has much more depth and symbolism: it tackles original sin; the mystical \"Beast\"; leadership, tribal allegiance and group dynamics (including bullying and attitudes to difference and minor disability) and the importance of ritual and belief.The second point is what makes LotF a better book, in my opinion.Of course, there are other, more obvious, parallels with extreme \"reality\" shows such as \"Survivor\" and \"I'm a Celebrity, get me out of here\", but the fundamental differences are not just that contestants in those shows do not fear for their lives, but that they are adults who havechosento enter.I TRIED TO ENJOY IT!Any fans who read this will now hate me.

            "Translation failed for: I genuinely can’t believe I finished this book, and I don’t mean that in an offhand,wow, what a garbage firesort of way. I mean that I’m actually fucking surprised that I managed to turn the last page of this and not immediately die of organ failure. And then my sister would have to come and break down my front door and find me contorted on my bed in my crusty old pyjamas with Dorito dust under my fingernails, and morticians would have to break my bones to pry this book out of my cold dead hands, and I’d need to come back as a ghost years later and write “It was for science” in lipstick on the bathroom mirror just to clear my name.In the year of our lord 20gayteen, it’s difficult to offer any sort of fresh or remotely nuanced critique onTwilightwithout resorting to edgelord tactics, like declaring that it’s a feminist read or that it was all an imaginary coping mechanism constructed by Bella to make returning to the shite little town of Forks bearable. But I think our judgement has been clouded for the past ten to twelve years - at least mine has, by the endless slew of stale “still a better love story” memes and the constant personal jabs aimed at Stephenie Meyer by mainstream media. There’s also the YA scene’s insidious desire to erase all memory of it from genre history: when I was doing research for this review, I foundthis videoin which multiple YA authors explain what their influences were for writing female-centric YA stories, and not one of them mentionsTwilight, which… Whoa. Like, that’s astounding to me. It's just disingenuous as fuck, that they had thegallto brazenly omit Stephenie Meyer from their credit lines, particularly when one or more of them started their careers in paranormal YA on the tail of theTwilightboom. Eventhis video, which claims to illustrate the history of YA, downplaysTwilight'sinfluence on the genre.YA existed beforeTwilight, of course, but it baffles me when the YA industry now slaps its hands to its ears and la-la-las over the indisputable truth: YA was a marginalised genre before theTwilightphenomenon. Was it a coincidence that YA paranormal romance exploded upon the rising popularity ofTwilight? You could argue that it was, of course, and you’re entitled to your wrong opinion, but I did not unironically Google “Edward Cullen star sign” for you hoes to come at me with “what aboutCatcher in the Rye”. FuckCatcher in the Rye. I’m not explaining that opinion any further and not will I defend it. Fuck that book and fuck all of its smug knock-offs, because if you polish a turd it’s still a turd. I'm sorry, but I don't make the rules.The basic breakdown is this: I enjoyed this book, and I mean I genuinely enjoyed it, and was invested, until about the halfway mark. After that, it was impossible for me to ignore the cloying creepiness that perverts a sweet and tender love story into something that, as an adult, is difficult for me to justify. When I was 13, I was a stan forTwilight, but not because of the books - I had only seen the movies, and for this reason it feels like a missed opportunity, because I can’t accurately compare my feelings then to my feelings now. This inaccuracy stems mostly from the fact that the movies were afarcethat in no way capture the spirit of the characters or any of the relationships between them. It’s because of the movies that this series is the focus of such intense ridicule and hatred in the media; it’s the self-seriousness of the movies that’s so infuriating, because while the book is melodramatic and depressing, it’s light and jubilant where the movie isn’t. My main problem with the media’s perception of the series is that it’s based entirely on this self-seriousness, and in particular Kristen Stewart’s dead eyes.The truth is that Book Bella and Movie Bella are two starkly different people, and you can fucking fight me on this. It doesn’t surprise me that Stephenie Meyer isover itand has Moved On, because if I was her, I would genuinely be bitter as fuck, the most poisonous bitch, an actual Viṣakanyā, not only for the unstoppable barrage of media abuse but also for the forced image of my creative work as something completely separate from what it is.Meyer has weathered a barrage of criticism for herMormon lifestyle, and this has bled into her storytelling, and to an extent I agree, because heavy-handed morality is an easy way to drop a story down a U-bend. However, while Meyer’s inherent religious biases have centred heteronormativity and gender-based parameters, it may run deeper than this. The artery of conflict that threads through each book in the series is opposing ideals within the central relationship, and if we look at these characters as theological models, their connection does boast a bit more nuance: Edward is Mormonism and Bella is modernism, thus their relationship is a wrestle between starkly defined historical values and modern flexibility.To explore this model, it's worth analysing each character as an individual, not both as a unit (we'll get to that later). My impression of Bella is that she's confident in familiar situations and, contrary to common criticism, mostly generated from the appallingly weak and lifeless character in the movies, is not defined by low self-esteem. When several boys ask her out to the dance she never defaults to this modest cry of, “who, me?”; she’s weary of the attention, and shrugs off her pursuers by diverting their romantic efforts to her single friends (with whom she shares close, if superficial bonds, to be expected from people who haven't had much time to get to know each other outside of school). She never shrinks away from male attention, and while she does often acknowledge that Edward is aesthetically pleasing, her reaction to being seen with a \"dazzling\" and notorious man is a natural one: “Won’t people wonder why someone so special is out with someone so ordinary, like me?” This is not a new or particularly groundbreaking question to ask oneself, especially in young and emotionally charged relationships, and especially with someone like Bella, who is defined by her low-key and utilitarian outlook, and her discomfort with an excess of attention in social circles.Bella mentions that she was not popular in Arizona, but for defined reasons: She is not sporty or excessively outgoing, which the book lays out as defining traits of most Arizonans (as a non-American, I’m unable to confirm this as truth or condemn it as a false stereotype, but the author does live in Arizona). She also states that her last school was densely populated which, naturally, provides an ease of anonymity. Her move to Forks batters her with the scrutiny of the tight-knit community, due for the most part to her mother’s vaguely sordid reputation as “the Chief’s flighty ex-wife” (12), the Chief being Charlie, a trusted pillar of the community. Renée’s notoriety as an ex-Forks resident, an elusive outsider who left the town in her dust - an uncommon novelty - marks her as a kind of traitor to the community, and by extension, Bella shares this burden. Even without considering her mother’s impact on Forks’ social circle, Bella invites attention as a rare new face among a close circle of scandal-starved teens.Again and again, Bella is verbally lashed for a lack of personality or strong voice, but while Bella’s narration is introspective, this doesn’t strip her of personality (I mean it; this criticism is repeated ad nauseam). She’s a quiet, orderly girl who respects authority and values her studies, as much a cliché of its time as the “strong female protagonist” that has haunted YA for the past six years and has launched an oftentimes distasteful attack on traditional femininity, creating a dichotomy between “strong girl” and “weak girl\".But Bella can’t be neatly categorized with her knock-offs: she forfeited her happy, sunny life in Arizona for her mother’s benefit, a notably selfless choice, and not a courtesy that her mother necessarily deserves. Renée's neglectful parenting is often brushed aside as she hounds Bella via email and phone, creating an unsavoury illusion of parental concern. In reality, Renée is immature and self-involved, leaving bills unpaid and the fridge bare, darting off to pursue an unsustainable life on the road while she has a dependent minor at home. This is commented on in a particularly telling passage wherein Bella is concerned about leaving her “erratic, harebrained mother” (4) to fend for herself: “Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost” (4). It's a troubling role reversal that plays out in a similar, albeit softer, fashion when Bella moves in with her father and is immediately forced to take on basic duties in the home, due to her father’s ineptitude in the kitchen and in homemaking.But Bella is an independent girl who doesn’t want to shoehorn her mother into the same situation that she fled in Forks, so she moves away to stay with her father purely for Renée’s benefit. But her relationship with Charlie is tender: when Tyler’s truck nearly crushes her, she’s thinking fondly of her father, who got up early to put snow chains on the wheels of her truck. It’s the same sort of quiet thoughtfulness that defines Bella. When people like Jacob and Angela are being sidelined by their friends - ignored during a group conversation - Bella notices this and acknowledges them. Bella’s personality is quiet, but I wouldn't call it weak. (It's worth remembering that, in 2005, a \"ladylike front\" was very much in fashion and not only in religious circles like Meyer's. This \"touch my butt and buy me pizza\" attitude didn't come into fashion until Tumblr became mainstream, and until the internet popularised the Anna Kendrick brand. You know, this \"I'm a gross girl and I wear sweatpants and I like to swear\". That mentality wasn't part of the media hive mind yet.)Is this what catches Edward’s attention? In part, yes. Though more prominently it’s Bella’smysterythat attracts Edward. He can’t read her mind, thus their courtship requires rituals, wooing, a thrill that is missing entirely from Edward’s life. I mentioned in my status updates that I had a lot of feelings about Edward, his past and his pain, and to an extent I do; it’s another missed opportunity, because Edward’s past is handwaved, even though it influences every facet of his questionable behaviour, from his total lack of awareness about road safety, to his absurd and oftentimes bewildering fascination with Bella’s average life.Here’s the thing about Edward: he’s either too old or too young, depending on how you look at it. He was born on the cusp of living memory, which means that in 2005, he’s the same age as some people’s great grandparents, and this is what makes his relationship with Bella unacceptable. He’s not a relic, like Carlisle, or merely an older man. He is geriatric, and this adds an element of unavoidable perversion to his romance with a teenage girl. With a clear mind, it’s almost impossible not to recoil when Edward describes Bella as “appallingly luscious” or during this exchange:“‘That’s probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.’I brindled a little at the wordchild. ‘Jacob is not that much younger than I am,’ I reminded him.He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. ‘Oh, I know,’ he assured me with a grin.” (305)If we look at this from Carlisle’s point of view, then it becomes apparent that Edward’s age was a huge narrative blunder. Carlisle is 362, and if we sit back and contemplate the enormity of that, and the sheer gulf between him and someone who is seventeen, then it almost wouldn’t be so bad if Edward were also old as balls: he could be considered something other entirely, not an elderly man but a creature from another world, wholly divorced from Bella’s insular world. It would be as if she had fallen in love with an alien, or some eldritch beast from a parallel universe. It would require a lot more effort on Meyer's part to explain exactly what it is that makes their relationship hold together, and the politics between them would be more complex, but this would arguably have made for a more cerebral read. (Conversely, this is why I struggle to fully get on board withOutlander. Granted, I've only seen the TV show, but how could Claire and Jamie possibly find anything to talk about that's remotely relevant to either of their lives? He's never seen a bean can and he doesn't know what the telly is.) But ageing Edward up could, with some moral gymnastics and a constant reminder that Yes, This Is Weird, But We’re Going With It, remove him from Bella’s socio-political sphere just enough that it would almost be more acceptable.It's the poor decision to time Edward's birth at the beginning of the 20th century that really hits the nail into the coffin here. While it does comfortably serve the theological dichotomy between Edward and Bella (anyone significantly older would probably not be Mormon, as Mormonism wasn't a thing until the early-to-mid 1800s) it is a stumbling block for the believability of the romance. The movie and the book both struggle desperately to reconcile Edward’s point of view with Bella’s, neither one with enough sleight of hand to properly explore the intricacies of it; that said, at least in the book, Edward isfun:“‘You scared me for a minute there,’ [Edward] admitted after a pause… ‘I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.’‘Ha, ha.’ I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute.‘Honestly—I’ve seen corpses with better colour. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.’‘Poor Mike. I bet he’s mad.’‘He absolutely loathes me,’ Edward said cheerfully.” (85)In the movie, it’s impossible to understand why the hell this old man is chasing after this little girl, but in the book he’s charming and eloquent, and there are instances that beget genuine empathy—I couldn’t stop thinking about Edward’s total disregard for his own personal safety, his exclusion from society, this insular environment that Carlisle’s bite condemned him to. He is an old man caged in the body of a teenager, and his family only enables his self-destructive behaviour. I wouldn’t even call him a pervert: I would call him someone who is so psychologically damaged from a physical assault that he is clawing desperately to human affection to try to manufacture a sense of normalcy in his life. And Carlisle, his attacker, is now his sole benefactor, the puppeteer of a collection of ageless marionettes that obey his authority over their household. They survive at Carlisle’s pleasure; they play by his rules. But Edward states that the vampires do not sleep, and while sleep is necessary for growth and repair, it’s also vital for mental health. What has this created in Carlisle, a man who hasn’tsleptin around 340 years? Is there any way to measure the psychological damage this could cause, or are we seeing it now in this strange, macabre puppet show that is the Cullen clan?Is this an intentional angle? It’s hard to say. I doubt it, but I don’t think there’s such a thing as “reading too much” into stories, especially those that deal with extremely weighty topics such as immortality and love and pack mentality. What strikes me most here is that Bella is a victim of the Cullen clan, but so is Edward, and of course Rosalie. Edward, Rosalie, and Esme were all turned by Carlisle without their consent, and while they all were dying, and though this is passed off as noble by Carlisle, it doesn’t ring true.As asserted by the narrative, the “lawless” vampires, i.e. those who do not belong to a \"safe\" clan and who are not under the control of any other entity, and who hunt humans, are the villains of this story, but what makes them villainous is their disregard for human life, and that they justify this by citing their natural instincts. The vampires’ natural attractiveness, their smell, and their heightened senses all function for ease of hunting, and the Cullens are not exempt; the difference between them is that the ungoverned vampires hunt humans, and the Cullens do not.Or do they?Perhaps what Carlisle did can’t be labelled “hunting”, but it could be something worse. It could be the ultimate act of power and control, to stockpile living bodies, to use acts of brutality and violence to manufacture close familial bonds. Carlisle professes not to have given in to his baser instincts, but the truth may be that he did, not by killing but with a cultivated community of psychological torture. Edward states that Carlisle was lonely, but the problematic element to this is that Carlisle knewwhyhe was lonely - it was because immortality made him that way. His solution to this was to condemn other people to the same fate. One could ask why Carlisle was so certain that the other “Cullens” would bond with him, but my answer to this is that Carlisle made it that way: this was his design, to collect a trove of ghosts and lock them behind the doors of his estate.The Cullens will always be connected by the things that make them “other”, and in the end, so will Bella. She will become a Cullen too, but I’d say it’s not Edward’s fingers that are plucking her puppet strings.Is James the villain here? Perhaps. Perhaps not.This is a new prototype for my review layout and I'm hoping to create more graphics/interactive content in the future.

And then my sister would have to come and break down my front door and find me contorted on my bed in my crusty old pyjamas with Dorito dust under my fingernails, and morticians would have to break my bones to pry this book out of my cold dead hands, and I’d need to come back as a ghost years later and write “It was for science” in lipstick on the bathroom mirror just to clear my name.In the year of our lord 20gayteen, it’s difficult to offer any sort of fresh or remotely nuanced critique onTwilightwithout resorting to edgelord tactics, like declaring that it’s a feminist read or that it was all an imaginary coping mechanism constructed by Bella to make returning to the shite little town of Forks bearable. But I think our judgement has been clouded for the past ten to twelve years - at least mine has, by the endless slew of stale “still a better love story” memes and the constant personal jabs aimed at Stephenie Meyer by mainstream media. There’s also the YA scene’s insidious desire to erase all memory of it from genre history: when I was doing research for this review, I foundthis videoin which multiple YA authors explain what their influences were for writing female-centric YA stories, and not one of them mentionsTwilight, which… Whoa. Like, that’s astounding to me. It's just disingenuous as fuck, that they had thegallto brazenly omit Stephenie Meyer from their credit lines, particularly when one or more of them started their careers in paranormal YA on the tail of theTwilightboom. Eventhis video, which claims to illustrate the history of YA, downplaysTwilight'sinfluence on the genre.YA existed beforeTwilight, of course, but it baffles me when the YA industry now slaps its hands to its ears and la-la-las over the indisputable truth: YA was a marginalised genre before theTwilightphenomenon. Was it a coincidence that YA paranormal romance exploded upon the rising popularity ofTwilight? You could argue that it was, of course, and you’re entitled to your wrong opinion, but I did not unironically Google “Edward Cullen star sign” for you hoes to come at me with “what aboutCatcher in the Rye”. FuckCatcher in the Rye. I’m not explaining that opinion any further and not will I defend it. Fuck that book and fuck all of its smug knock-offs, because if you polish a turd it’s still a turd. I'm sorry, but I don't make the rules.The basic breakdown is this: I enjoyed this book, and I mean I genuinely enjoyed it, and was invested, until about the halfway mark. After that, it was impossible for me to ignore the cloying creepiness that perverts a sweet and tender love story into something that, as an adult, is difficult for me to justify. When I was 13, I was a stan forTwilight, but not because of the books - I had only seen the movies, and for this reason it feels like a missed opportunity, because I can’t accurately compare my feelings then to my feelings now. This inaccuracy stems mostly from the fact that the movies were afarcethat in no way capture the spirit of the characters or any of the relationships between them. It’s because of the movies that this series is the focus of such intense ridicule and hatred in the media; it’s the self-seriousness of the movies that’s so infuriating, because while the book is melodramatic and depressing, it’s light and jubilant where the movie isn’t. My main problem with the media’s perception of the series is that it’s based entirely on this self-seriousness, and in particular Kristen Stewart’s dead eyes.The truth is that Book Bella and Movie Bella are two starkly different people, and you can fucking fight me on this. It doesn’t surprise me that Stephenie Meyer isover itand has Moved On, because if I was her, I would genuinely be bitter as fuck, the most poisonous bitch, an actual Viṣakanyā, not only for the unstoppable barrage of media abuse but also for the forced image of my creative work as something completely separate from what it is.Meyer has weathered a barrage of criticism for herMormon lifestyle, and this has bled into her storytelling, and to an extent I agree, because heavy-handed morality is an easy way to drop a story down a U-bend. However, while Meyer’s inherent religious biases have centred heteronormativity and gender-based parameters, it may run deeper than this. The artery of conflict that threads through each book in the series is opposing ideals within the central relationship, and if we look at these characters as theological models, their connection does boast a bit more nuance: Edward is Mormonism and Bella is modernism, thus their relationship is a wrestle between starkly defined historical values and modern flexibility.To explore this model, it's worth analysing each character as an individual, not both as a unit (we'll get to that later). My impression of Bella is that she's confident in familiar situations and, contrary to common criticism, mostly generated from the appallingly weak and lifeless character in the movies, is not defined by low self-esteem. When several boys ask her out to the dance she never defaults to this modest cry of, “who, me?”; she’s weary of the attention, and shrugs off her pursuers by diverting their romantic efforts to her single friends (with whom she shares close, if superficial bonds, to be expected from people who haven't had much time to get to know each other outside of school). She never shrinks away from male attention, and while she does often acknowledge that Edward is aesthetically pleasing, her reaction to being seen with a \"dazzling\" and notorious man is a natural one: “Won’t people wonder why someone so special is out with someone so ordinary, like me?” This is not a new or particularly groundbreaking question to ask oneself, especially in young and emotionally charged relationships, and especially with someone like Bella, who is defined by her low-key and utilitarian outlook, and her discomfort with an excess of attention in social circles.Bella mentions that she was not popular in Arizona, but for defined reasons: She is not sporty or excessively outgoing, which the book lays out as defining traits of most Arizonans (as a non-American, I’m unable to confirm this as truth or condemn it as a false stereotype, but the author does live in Arizona). She also states that her last school was densely populated which, naturally, provides an ease of anonymity. Her move to Forks batters her with the scrutiny of the tight-knit community, due for the most part to her mother’s vaguely sordid reputation as “the Chief’s flighty ex-wife” (12), the Chief being Charlie, a trusted pillar of the community. Renée’s notoriety as an ex-Forks resident, an elusive outsider who left the town in her dust - an uncommon novelty - marks her as a kind of traitor to the community, and by extension, Bella shares this burden. Even without considering her mother’s impact on Forks’ social circle, Bella invites attention as a rare new face among a close circle of scandal-starved teens.Again and again, Bella is verbally lashed for a lack of personality or strong voice, but while Bella’s narration is introspective, this doesn’t strip her of personality (I mean it; this criticism is repeated ad nauseam). She’s a quiet, orderly girl who respects authority and values her studies, as much a cliché of its time as the “strong female protagonist” that has haunted YA for the past six years and has launched an oftentimes distasteful attack on traditional femininity, creating a dichotomy between “strong girl” and “weak girl\".But Bella can’t be neatly categorized with her knock-offs: she forfeited her happy, sunny life in Arizona for her mother’s benefit, a notably selfless choice, and not a courtesy that her mother necessarily deserves. Renée's neglectful parenting is often brushed aside as she hounds Bella via email and phone, creating an unsavoury illusion of parental concern. In reality, Renée is immature and self-involved, leaving bills unpaid and the fridge bare, darting off to pursue an unsustainable life on the road while she has a dependent minor at home. This is commented on in a particularly telling passage wherein Bella is concerned about leaving her “erratic, harebrained mother” (4) to fend for herself: “Of course she had Phil now, so the bills would probably get paid, there would be food in the refrigerator, gas in her car, and someone to call when she got lost” (4). It's a troubling role reversal that plays out in a similar, albeit softer, fashion when Bella moves in with her father and is immediately forced to take on basic duties in the home, due to her father’s ineptitude in the kitchen and in homemaking.But Bella is an independent girl who doesn’t want to shoehorn her mother into the same situation that she fled in Forks, so she moves away to stay with her father purely for Renée’s benefit. But her relationship with Charlie is tender: when Tyler’s truck nearly crushes her, she’s thinking fondly of her father, who got up early to put snow chains on the wheels of her truck. It’s the same sort of quiet thoughtfulness that defines Bella. When people like Jacob and Angela are being sidelined by their friends - ignored during a group conversation - Bella notices this and acknowledges them. Bella’s personality is quiet, but I wouldn't call it weak. (It's worth remembering that, in 2005, a \"ladylike front\" was very much in fashion and not only in religious circles like Meyer's. This \"touch my butt and buy me pizza\" attitude didn't come into fashion until Tumblr became mainstream, and until the internet popularised the Anna Kendrick brand. You know, this \"I'm a gross girl and I wear sweatpants and I like to swear\". That mentality wasn't part of the media hive mind yet.)Is this what catches Edward’s attention? In part, yes. Though more prominently it’s Bella’smysterythat attracts Edward. He can’t read her mind, thus their courtship requires rituals, wooing, a thrill that is missing entirely from Edward’s life. I mentioned in my status updates that I had a lot of feelings about Edward, his past and his pain, and to an extent I do; it’s another missed opportunity, because Edward’s past is handwaved, even though it influences every facet of his questionable behaviour, from his total lack of awareness about road safety, to his absurd and oftentimes bewildering fascination with Bella’s average life.Here’s the thing about Edward: he’s either too old or too young, depending on how you look at it. He was born on the cusp of living memory, which means that in 2005, he’s the same age as some people’s great grandparents, and this is what makes his relationship with Bella unacceptable. He’s not a relic, like Carlisle, or merely an older man. He is geriatric, and this adds an element of unavoidable perversion to his romance with a teenage girl. With a clear mind, it’s almost impossible not to recoil when Edward describes Bella as “appallingly luscious” or during this exchange:“‘That’s probably best. Be careful, though. The child has no idea.’I brindled a little at the wordchild. ‘Jacob is not that much younger than I am,’ I reminded him.He looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. ‘Oh, I know,’ he assured me with a grin.” (305)If we look at this from Carlisle’s point of view, then it becomes apparent that Edward’s age was a huge narrative blunder. Carlisle is 362, and if we sit back and contemplate the enormity of that, and the sheer gulf between him and someone who is seventeen, then it almost wouldn’t be so bad if Edward were also old as balls: he could be considered something other entirely, not an elderly man but a creature from another world, wholly divorced from Bella’s insular world. It would be as if she had fallen in love with an alien, or some eldritch beast from a parallel universe. It would require a lot more effort on Meyer's part to explain exactly what it is that makes their relationship hold together, and the politics between them would be more complex, but this would arguably have made for a more cerebral read. (Conversely, this is why I struggle to fully get on board withOutlander. Granted, I've only seen the TV show, but how could Claire and Jamie possibly find anything to talk about that's remotely relevant to either of their lives? He's never seen a bean can and he doesn't know what the telly is.) But ageing Edward up could, with some moral gymnastics and a constant reminder that Yes, This Is Weird, But We’re Going With It, remove him from Bella’s socio-political sphere just enough that it would almost be more acceptable.It's the poor decision to time Edward's birth at the beginning of the 20th century that really hits the nail into the coffin here. While it does comfortably serve the theological dichotomy between Edward and Bella (anyone significantly older would probably not be Mormon, as Mormonism wasn't a thing until the early-to-mid 1800s) it is a stumbling block for the believability of the romance. The movie and the book both struggle desperately to reconcile Edward’s point of view with Bella’s, neither one with enough sleight of hand to properly explore the intricacies of it; that said, at least in the book, Edward isfun:“‘You scared me for a minute there,’ [Edward] admitted after a pause… ‘I thought Newton was dragging your dead body off to bury it in the woods.’‘Ha, ha.’ I still had my eyes closed, but I was feeling more normal every minute.‘Honestly—I’ve seen corpses with better colour. I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.’‘Poor Mike. I bet he’s mad.’‘He absolutely loathes me,’ Edward said cheerfully.” (85)In the movie, it’s impossible to understand why the hell this old man is chasing after this little girl, but in the book he’s charming and eloquent, and there are instances that beget genuine empathy—I couldn’t stop thinking about Edward’s total disregard for his own personal safety, his exclusion from society, this insular environment that Carlisle’s bite condemned him to. He is an old man caged in the body of a teenager, and his family only enables his self-destructive behaviour. I wouldn’t even call him a pervert: I would call him someone who is so psychologically damaged from a physical assault that he is clawing desperately to human affection to try to manufacture a sense of normalcy in his life. And Carlisle, his attacker, is now his sole benefactor, the puppeteer of a collection of ageless marionettes that obey his authority over their household. They survive at Carlisle’s pleasure; they play by his rules. But Edward states that the vampires do not sleep, and while sleep is necessary for growth and repair, it’s also vital for mental health. What has this created in Carlisle, a man who hasn’tsleptin around 340 years? Is there any way to measure the psychological damage this could cause, or are we seeing it now in this strange, macabre puppet show that is the Cullen clan?Is this an intentional angle? It’s hard to say. I doubt it, but I don’t think there’s such a thing as “reading too much” into stories, especially those that deal with extremely weighty topics such as immortality and love and pack mentality. What strikes me most here is that Bella is a victim of the Cullen clan, but so is Edward, and of course Rosalie. Edward, Rosalie, and Esme were all turned by Carlisle without their consent, and while they all were dying, and though this is passed off as noble by Carlisle, it doesn’t ring true.As asserted by the narrative, the “lawless” vampires, i.e. those who do not belong to a \"safe\" clan and who are not under the control of any other entity, and who hunt humans, are the villains of this story, but what makes them villainous is their disregard for human life, and that they justify this by citing their natural instincts. The vampires’ natural attractiveness, their smell, and their heightened senses all function for ease of hunting, and the Cullens are not exempt; the difference between them is that the ungoverned vampires hunt humans, and the Cullens do not.Or do they?Perhaps what Carlisle did can’t be labelled “hunting”, but it could be something worse. It could be the ultimate act of power and control, to stockpile living bodies, to use acts of brutality and violence to manufacture close familial bonds. Carlisle professes not to have given in to his baser instincts, but the truth may be that he did, not by killing but with a cultivated community of psychological torture. Edward states that Carlisle was lonely, but the problematic element to this is that Carlisle knewwhyhe was lonely - it was because immortality made him that way. His solution to this was to condemn other people to the same fate. One could ask why Carlisle was so certain that the other “Cullens” would bond with him, but my answer to this is that Carlisle made it that way: this was his design, to collect a trove of ghosts and lock them behind the doors of his estate.The Cullens will always be connected by the things that make them “other”, and in the end, so will Bella. She will become a Cullen too, but I’d say it’s not Edward’s fingers that are plucking her puppet strings.Is James the villain here? Perhaps. Perhaps not.This is a new prototype for my review layout and I'm hoping to create more graphics/interactive content in the future.

            "Translation failed for: This is a review I never imagined I’d write. This is a book I was convinced I’d love. I just have to face the facts, Emily is no Charlotte.I’m going to start with the positives. The characterisation of Heathcliff is incredibly strong. He is a man who is utterly tormented by the world. As a gypsy boy he is dark skinned and dark haired, and to the English this rough, almost wild, look makes him a ruffian. He stands up for himself, and bites back; thus, he is termed a monster. In a very, very, Frankenstein’s monster like sense, his perceived outer image begins to permeate his soul. Call a man a monster, and eventually he may start acting like one.“He’s not a rough diamond - a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic; he’s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man.”He is a very complex man, capable of great cruelty and kindness. The world has made him bitter, and in a way ruined him. He reaps revenge, but revenge always ends the same way; it doesn’t solve problems but creates more. So he becomes even more tormented, this time by his own actions. \tHe is very Byronic, and by today’s standards a little bit of a bad boy. He has all the standard tropes of an anti-hero, one that becomes a figure that can be sympathised with and hated. He’s a very complex man.The Bronte’s were directly affected by Byron’s poetry. Rochester is Charlotte’s portrayal of a similar, albeit less vengeful, character. Love is the key torment in both works. Heathcliff has been rejected, as Rochester cannot open his heart because of his secret wife. But, rather that overcome his personal loss, and subject the world to his dark and broody personality, Heathcliff actually seeks to do others harm. He is a very sensitive man when it comes to his own emotions, though he lacks any real empathy. He does not care that he is creating more pain for others. He spends his life spreading more hate into the world. His only redeeming quality is his love for Catherine, but that doesn’t excuse his tyranny. He knows how nasty he is:\"She abandoned [her home] under a delusion,\" he answered, \"picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished.\"He's so self-centred:So I rather like his character, well not like but appreciate the complexity, though the novel’s structure itself was abysmal. I have quite a few problems with the narrative.Why is a servant telling us this story as she speaks to a visitor of her master’s house? Why are we hearing someone’s interpretation of the events rather than the events themselves? Why is it twenty years later in the form of an extremely long conversation? Why is the servant still actually working for Heathcliff? She would have left. Nobody would choose to work for such a man. It just doesn’t make a lot of sense. At times it felt like the credibility of the story was stretched to breaking point. Nelly (the servant) actually being in some of the scenes was almost laughable. Often it was followed by a terrible explanation attempting to justify her presence. It sounded very desperate to me.This leads perfectly on to my next point. Half way through the story (the start of volume ii) we are told that the conversation has ended. We then hear the visitor’s description of the servant’s narrative about Heathcliff’s life. I mean seriously? So there are three layers of storytelling. Isn’t that completely unnecessary and overcomplicated? Why not just have Heathcliff tell the story or at the very least have the servant tell the story from start to finish in one story arc with no time shifts. For me, it felt like Emily wrote herself into a corner with her choice of narrative and desperately tried to write herself out of it to the point of ridiculousness. How much of the story can we believe? How much bias is in the narratives?Then there was the dialogue overloads. Large parts of the novel were entirely conversational. The narration was minimalistic and bare. The only character whose thoughts we were privy to, again Nelly the servant, was completely irrelevant to the plot. Who cares about the servant’s emotion and reactions? This isn’t her story; thus, the dialogue was packed out to the point of unnaturalness to fit in the thoughts of characters whose minds we weren’t privy to. Simply put, the characters said things people wouldn’t realistically say in conversation. It was overflowing with emotions and private thoughts. It was awkward. I’m not talking about private conversations, those don’t happen as Nelly is awkwardly present for every single event, but announcements or decisions (that should be internal) announced to a group of people. This is why plays have asides and soliloquies. And this is why novels aren’t told from the perspective of a random servant.There is clearly a great story here. Plot wise the novel is wonderful. But the way in which Emily told her story was nothing short of disastrous. It felt like a wasted opportunity. I’m absolutely horrified at how poor it is. This novel needed to be taken apart, re-wrote, and put back together again. Perhaps then it would have been worthy of the story it failed to tell. I’ve never been so massively underwhelmed in such a blatant lack of skill in a canonised piece of literature, one that has immense critical reception.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________, error: This is a review I never imagined I’d write. This is a book I was convinced I’d love. I just have to face the facts, Emily is no Charlotte.I’m going to start with the positives. The characterisation of Heathcliff is incredibly strong. He is a man who is utterly tormented by the world. As a gypsy boy he is dark skinned and dark haired, and to the English this rough, almost wild, look makes him a ruffian. He stands up for himself, and bites back; thus, he is termed a monster. In a very, very, Frankenstein’s monster like sense, his perceived outer image begins to permeate his soul. Call a man a monster, and eventually he may start acting like one.“He’s not a rough diamond - a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic; he’s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man.”He is a very complex man, capable of great cruelty and kindness. The world has made him bitter, and in a way ruined him. He reaps revenge, but revenge always ends the same way; it doesn’t solve problems but creates more. So he becomes even more tormented, this time by his own actions. \tHe is very Byronic, and by today’s standards a little bit of a bad boy. He has all the standard tropes of an anti-hero, one that becomes a figure that can be sympathised with and hated. He’s a very complex man.The Bronte’s were directly affected by Byron’s poetry. Rochester is Charlotte’s portrayal of a similar, albeit less vengeful, character. Love is the key torment in both works. Heathcliff has been rejected, as Rochester cannot open his heart because of his secret wife. But, rather that overcome his personal loss, and subject the world to his dark and broody personality, Heathcliff actually seeks to do others harm. He is a very sensitive man when it comes to his own emotions, though he lacks any real empathy. He does not care that he is creating more pain for others. He spends his life spreading more hate into the world. His only redeeming quality is his love for Catherine, but that doesn’t excuse his tyranny. He knows how nasty he is:\"She abandoned [her home] under a delusion,\" he answered, \"picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished.\"He's so self-centred:So I rather like his character, well not like but appreciate the complexity, though the novel’s structure itself was abysmal. I have quite a few problems with the narrative.Why is a servant telling us this story as she speaks to a visitor of her master’s house? Why are we hearing someone’s interpretation of the events rather than the events themselves? Why is it twenty years later in the form of an extremely long conversation? Why is the servant still actually working for Heathcliff? She would have left. Nobody would choose to work for such a man. It just doesn’t make a lot of sense. At times it felt like the credibility of the story was stretched to breaking point. Nelly (the servant) actually being in some of the scenes was almost laughable. Often it was followed by a terrible explanation attempting to justify her presence. It sounded very desperate to me.This leads perfectly on to my next point.

            "Translation failed for: “Trying to untie the string and going to the window, to the light (all her windows were closed, despite the stuffiness), she left him completely for a few seconds and turned her back to him. He unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the loop but did not quite take it out yet; he just held it in his right hand under the coat. His hands were terribly weak; he felt them growing more and more numb and stiff every moment. He was afraid he would let go and drop the axe…suddenly his head seemed to spin…”-\tFyodor Dostoevsky,Crime and Punishment(My raging, Raskolnikov-like conscious could not rest without warning you of potential spoilers ahead!)The problem with being a high school student with average intelligence is that you can get fairly good grades with fairly minimal effort. It is an invitation to cut corners and utilize only one half your ass. This happened to me in English class. I'd sit back, take good notes, and bluff my way through various tests (this was back in the day before Google, when my family only had an AOL dial-up connection and all the answers, right and wrong, were on the internet). For these sins, I am now fated to read the classics long after I was supposed to read them.On the plus side, coming to the classics on my own volition has given me a better appreciation than having to read them with a figurative gun to the head. This has allowed me to enjoy certain works to a higher degree.However, I don't think any number of years will allow me to appreciate or enjoy or even suffer Fyodor Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishment.First published in 1866,Crime and Punishmentis the excruciatingly-detailed psycho-epic about the murder of a pawn shop owner (and her sister). The murderer is named Raskolnikov. He is a former student living in a wretched little closet apartment. He is utterly unlikable: smug, arrogant, temperamental, condescending and self-delusional. Today, we would recognize this person as having a serious mental illness (and the book would be calledInability To Form Criminal Intent and Involuntary Commitmentinstead ofCrime and Punishment). Dostoevsky, though, presents Raskolnikov's malady as spiritual, rather than mental. In a way, he is just like every grad student you've ever met: shiftless; over-educated and under-employed; haughty, yet prone to bouts of self-loathing. I imagine if this book was written in the next century, Raskolnikov would have shaggy sideburns, wear a t-shirt emblazoned with Che's image, and have a well-hidden addiction to prescription pain pills.Raskolnikov has some interesting theories. He's a Nietzsche-inspired proto-Nazi who believes that the world can be divided into two classes: an elite, Napoleonic class, free to do what they wish; and a second class comprised of everyone else. This former class, because of their elevated standing, don't have to follow the rules.Armed with this self-serving worldview, Raskolnikov, in need of money, determines that the pawn broker Alyona Ivanovna is a louse who deserves to die. So he takes his axe and a fake pledge to her apartment and bashes her head in. The crime is suitably graphic:He took the axe all the way out, swung it with both hands, scarcely aware of himself, and almost without effort...brought the butt-end down on her head...Because she was short, the blow happened to land right on the crown of her head. She cried out, but very faintly, and her whole body suddenly sank to the floor, though she still managed to raise both hands to her head...Then he struck her again and yet again with all his strength...Blood poured out as from an overturned glass...Once the murder is complete, very early in the novel, the long, slow, excruciating psychological unraveling begins. Some of Raskolnikov's madness is displayed through seemingly-endless internal monologues. Is this what it's like to be a crazy person? Maybe, maybe not. But it's effective in its way, because it drove me insane reading it.Raskolnikov's deterioration is also presented via his relationships. Despite being an utter jackass, he has a lot of friends and family who care for him. Among them is the doting Natasha, a housekeeper at Raskolnikov's apartment; a doctor named Zossimov; and Raskolnikov's “best friend” Razumikhin, who is a bit like Milhouse fromThe Simpsons, though a bit more refined. He looks after Raskolnikov, tries to get him a job, and suffers all Raskolnikov's verbal abuse with unflagging patience. I couldn't decide what annoyed me more: Raskolnikov's monomania or Razumikhin's spinelessness.Complicating this picture are several uninteresting plot threads that eventually, finally, after hundreds of pages, merge. One thread deals with Marmeladov, a wrecked old drunk whose daughter, Sonia, is a prostitute (with a heart of gold!). Raskolnikov is eventually redeemed by Sonia and Sonia's faith. A second thread has to do with Raskolnikov's mother and sister. His sister, Dunya, has come to St. Petersburg under a cloud, though things are looking brighter for her and the family, as she is engaged to Luzhin. Luzhin has money, and a keen eye for beautiful, vulnerable women. Raskolnikov rightly senses Luzhin's ill intent, and the animosity between the two men does not help Raskolnikov's troubled mind.On top of all this, there is a clever, Dickensian police inspector named Porfiry Petrovich. He knows immediately that Raskolnikov is the murderer, yet insists on playing a lame game of cat-and-mouse. One of the few enjoyments I got from this novel was the cold irony of a Russian police officer patiently waiting for his suspect to confess. In Dostoevsky's Russia, the law is clever, intelligent, and implacable. Of course, just a few decades later, the NKVD and KGB would be breaking down doors in the middle of the night and hustling people off to Siberia for no reason at all.To Dostoevsky's credit, all these characters intertwine, and all the stories pay off, such as it is. In order to do so, however, there are plot contrivances piled atop plot contrivances. Dostoevsky relies heavily on characters overhearing important bits of information.The only Russian novels I've read have been by Tolstoy, so I don't have much to compare this to. I'm not fit to analyzeCrime and Punishmentagainst other works of Russian literature, or even against Dostoevsky's other books. All I know was that this was a drag to read. There are paragraphs that go on for pages, and the density – unleavened by any action – is numbing.One of the most common complaints when reading Russian literature is the names. It's almost become a cliché. Well, in this case, it's true. At least – for the benefit of English speakers – Tolstoy gave his characters American nicknames. Here, you have to deal with both the patronymicsandidentical-sounding or near-identically-named characters. The easiest task you have is not mixing up Raskolnikov with Razumikhin. It gets a little harder trying to keep Alyona Ivanovna (the pawnbroker), Katerina Ivanovna (Sonia's mother) and Amalia Ivanovna (Sonia's mother's landlord) straight. Also remember that Dunya goes by the name Dunechka or Avdotya Romanovna (but that Porfiry Petrovich isnotthe same as Ilya Petrovich). These complaints are childish, I know, and I have no excuse. Yet I feel the need to unburden myself now, as I missed my chance in high school many, many (many, many) years ago.More confusing than the names is the culture shock. When I first tried to readCrime and Punishmentas a teenager, I chalked my confusion up to a poor translation. Well, this time around, the translation is in the incredibly capable hands of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. They managed, inAnna KareninaandWar and Peaceto be both faithful and readable. (They are recognized, by people far smarter than me, as the best Russian-to-English translators around).Here, again, I have no complaints with the translation; but I also had a revelation: I don't get Russians. I don't fully grasp their social hierarchy; I don't get why they like mustaches on women; and I certainly don't understand their interactions. They get mad for reasons I can't comprehend; they are insulted for reasons I do not fathom. In Dostoevsky's hands, Russians are hopelessly operatic, incapable of having a subtle or nuanced reaction to anything. Every emotion has an exclamation mark. You get Dunya trying to shoot Svidrigailov one second, and then tearfully embracing him the next. Characters fall on their knees before each other, and laugh at inappropriate times, and have opaque motivations. I am not trying to be culturally insensitive when I say I am confounded by the Russians inCrime and Punishment.Of course, there are enjoyable moments, including a classic set-piece following Marmeladov's funeral (imagine a Russian version ofClue, in which accusations are followed by counter-accusations, and everyone is shouting and fainting). Surprisingly, there is also a good bit of humor, such as this interaction between Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov regarding the morality of eavesdropping:In that case, go and tell the authorities; say thus and so, I've had this mishap: there was a little mistake in my theory. But if you're convinced that one cannot eavesdrop at doors, but can go around whacking old crones with whatever comes to hand, to your heart's content, then leave quickly for America somewhere!When I was young, I often gave up on challenging books likeCrime and Punishment. If I managed to finish – or at least come close – I treated them with snark, which was obviously a self-defense mechanism, hiding an unspoken belief that maybe I just wasn’t smart enough to get it (whateveritwas). When I got a little older – when I was no longer a kid, but didn’t have kids of my own – I went back to those classics I had dismissed, as a way to test myself. Older still – with kids of my own who don’t have their own kids – I circled back again, a strange sort of revisiting in which I tried to remember my past self through literature. Sometimes, I found myself revising old opinions.The Scarlet Letter, for instance, worked for me as an adult in a way it never had when I barely skimmed it in my youth.Crime and Punishment, however, is never a classic I am going to love (and I’m unlikely to give it another try). Yet, in the perverse way of classics, it is utterly memorable, if only because I struggled so hard to get through it. Believing this a worthwhile hill to climb, I did not give up, even though I could have finished three others books in the time it took me to slog through this one. Heck, despite not liking this the first time, I even gave it an entire second reading. Thus, even though I can’t stand it,Crime and Punishmentwill be somewhere in my headspace forever, a vague recollection of mustachioed women,strongemotional reactions, and a know-it-all with an axe., error: “Trying to untie the string and going to the window, to the light (all her windows were closed, despite the stuffiness), she left him completely for a few seconds and turned her back to him.

            "Translation failed for: I was noticing a new friend’s book shelf and how he likes children’s books just as I do. He had read Alice in Wonderland. I had read it as a child. I ask myself: Did I really like that book back then? Was it just given to me and that was all I had to read? Did my mother pick my books? And why were they always a certain kind of book, like Cinderella and The Wizard of Oz? Why were they not Robinson and Crusoe and Treasure Island?I can’t imagine liking these books now. I don’t like fantasy except say for Tolkien, but that may be unfair since I have not really tried any outside of Mockingjay, which I hated, but I read it because I was in a book group, not that I read everything they threw at me, which means I hated most.As to Alice, who cares about a girl who takes pills, and how one pill made her larger and one pill made her small? The song was good, White Rabbit. Love Minus Zero was a far better song. Maybe this book would have been better if written by a hippie.Speaking of which, I was never in to taking drugs in the 60s or 70s. So. as for Alice in Wonderland, I never wanted to read it again or even analyze it to even know why the hippies loved the book, or even if they did. Still, I liked the hippies, those back to the landers, that is, those who didn't sit around stoned all day.And back to my youth: I read everything. I read labels, cereal boxes, bill boards, and I loved those Burma Shave signs along the highways, where one sign said: Shave the modern way, and one sign said: No brush. The next sign said, No lather / No rub-in / Big tube 35 cents - Drug stores / Burma-Shave. I say, Who can beat that?When I grew older I always tried to see what a stranger was reading, the book in their hands. Sometimes I would ask. When I was in college I began collecting children’s books because I hadn’t read them as a child. Wind in the Willow was one I bought, but I never read it. I wondered why my mother didn’t take me to the library earlier in my life and stock me up on children’s books. I grew up with deprivation of environment, I thought. Maybe it was because she had just gone through a divorce when I was 8 years old and had to work, get her life back together. I only remember that as a teenager, we went together to the library sometmes. We read Bridey Murphy and Lost Books of the Bible and wondered if reincarnation was real, and why wasn’t Jesus’ childhood in the Bible and where did Cain get his wife.And then in my early teens, I found the section of books about mountain people. I have no idea what attracted me to this genre. I do know that there was a wonderful librarian, a woman, who, when I came up to the desk and asked for more books on the mountain people would lead me to them. And now I know, a lightbulb just went off in my head. It was her that introduced me to my first book about mountain people. It was The Shepherd of the Hills, and then she took me to The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, or it was the other way around. Then came Gene Stratton-Porter, and next it was the Bald Knobbers, and all by myself I found Tobacco Road, which my mother took away, telling me that it was a dirty book. Next, I was reading one about the area where I lived, The Salinas: Upside Down River, and years later a friend gave it to me without realizing that I had read it. I got into the Nancy Drew and the Dana Sisters next, liking the latter series better. I loved westerns and read most on their shelves. I read about the outlaws and how Jesse James came to Paso Robles where I lived. I read one that I could never find again: The main character was a sheriff or a marshal, and his name was Jack Slader. I still wish that I could find it. Next, I was into the non-fiction books, veterinarian medicine, how to increase your memory and who knows what all. I wanted to know everything. I just didn't want to know about Alice or Cinderella or even Peter Pan anymore.This reminds me of a older man who used to come into the library who talked with me. It probably wasn’t often, but I knew him just because he was around. He told me that he wanted to learn every word in the dictionary and then go on The Millionaire and get rich. I thought how good it would be to increase my own vocabulary, but it was always so boring, so I never got past Aardvark and used to call my brother one. If only the other words were just as interesting.Then I met the man who cleaned up the park where the library was located. He showed me the pond with the mosquito fish that was hidden in the trees and gave me some for my aquarium. He showed me pine nuts and said that they were good to eat. He even showed me how I could find them in pine cones, that is, if the squirrels hadn’t gathered them first. And last of all he showed me how all the trees in the park had name tags in English and in Latin.So, yes, my mother had to work to support us kids, and I heard a lot of “Go out and play,” by my older sister who quit high school to take care of us, and that I did. That part was wonderful because I could go anywhere in town, to the library, down to the river with my dog or into the hills where I would sometimes come home with poison oak. I remember how I explored every shop in town, every corner, every street, even the alleys where people had wonderful gardens. One day my friend Mary and I went into the Mercantile to try on men’s hats. We told the clerk that we wanted to buy our dads a hat, and the clerk didn’t even care, although we knew that he didn’t believe us. Exploring was fun.But as for this book, I would never think to read it again even though I have long missed watching Disney World on our TV on Sundays nights. What do I watch instead, The Walking Dead. My how times have changed., error: I was noticing a new friend’s book shelf and how he likes children’s books just as I do. He had read Alice in Wonderland. I had read it as a child. I ask myself: Did I really like that book back then? Was it just given to me and that was all I had to read? Did my mother pick my books? And why were they always a certain kind of book, like Cinderella and The Wizard of Oz? Why were they not Robinson and Crusoe and Treasure Island?I can’t imagine liking these books now. I don’t like fantasy except say for Tolkien, but that may be unfair since I have not really tried any outside of Mockingjay, which I hated, but I read it because I was in a book group, not that I read everything they threw at me, which means I hated most.As to Alice, who cares about a girl who takes pills, and how one pill made her larger and one pill made her small? The song was good, White Rabbit. Love Minus Zero was a far better song. Maybe this book would have been better if written by a hippie.Speaking of which, I was never in to taking drugs in the 60s or 70s. So. as for Alice in Wonderland, I never wanted to read it again or even analyze it to even know why the hippies loved the book, or even if they did. Still, I liked the hippies, those back to the landers, that is, those who didn't sit around stoned all day.And back to my youth: I read everything. I read labels, cereal boxes, bill boards, and I loved those Burma Shave signs along the highways, where one sign said: Shave the modern way, and one sign said: No brush. The next sign said, No lather / No rub-in / Big tube 35 cents - Drug stores / Burma-Shave. I say, Who can beat that?When I grew older I always tried to see what a stranger was reading, the book in their hands. Sometimes I would ask. When I was in college I began collecting children’s books because I hadn’t read them as a child. Wind in the Willow was one I bought, but I never read it. I wondered why my mother didn’t take me to the library earlier in my life and stock me up on children’s books. I grew up with deprivation of environment, I thought. Maybe it was because she had just gone through a divorce when I was 8 years old and had to work, get her life back together. I only remember that as a teenager, we went together to the library sometmes. We read Bridey Murphy and Lost Books of the Bible and wondered if reincarnation was real, and why wasn’t Jesus’ childhood in the Bible and where did Cain get his wife.And then in my early teens, I found the section of books about mountain people. I have no idea what attracted me to this genre. I do know that there was a wonderful librarian, a woman, who, when I came up to the desk and asked for more books on the mountain people would lead me to them. And now I know, a lightbulb just went off in my head. It was her that introduced me to my first book about mountain people. It was The Shepherd of the Hills, and then she took me to The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, or it was the other way around. Then came Gene Stratton-Porter, and next it was the Bald Knobbers, and all by myself I found Tobacco Road, which my mother took away, telling me that it was a dirty book. Next, I was reading one about the area where I lived, The Salinas: Upside Down River, and years later a friend gave it to me without realizing that I had read it. I got into the Nancy Drew and the Dana Sisters next, liking the latter series better. I loved westerns and read most on their shelves. I read about the outlaws and how Jesse James came to Paso Robles where I lived. I read one that I could never find again: The main character was a sheriff or a marshal, and his name was Jack Slader. I still wish that I could find it. Next, I was into the non-fiction books, veterinarian medicine, how to increase your memory and who knows what all. I wanted to know everything. I just didn't want to know about Alice or Cinderella or even Peter Pan anymore.This reminds me of a older man who used to come into the library who talked with me. It probably wasn’t often, but I knew him just because he was around. He told me that he wanted to learn every word in the dictionary and then go on The Millionaire and get rich. I thought how good it would be to increase my own vocabulary, but it was always so boring, so I never got past Aardvark and used to call my brother one. If only the other words were just as interesting.Then I met the man who cleaned up the park where the library was located. He showed me the pond with the mosquito fish that was hidden in the trees and gave me some for my aquarium. He showed me pine nuts and said that they were good to eat. He even showed me how I could find them in pine cones, that is, if the squirrels hadn’t gathered them first. And last of all he showed me how all the trees in the park had name tags in English and in Latin.So, yes, my mother had to work to support us kids, and I heard a lot of “Go out and play,” by my older sister who quit high school to take care of us, and that I did.

            "Translation failed for: What kind of ridiculous mess...Oh man.So I know I say this in dissenting opinion, as many on my friends list are partial to this book, but I could not stand it. So before I go off on my tirade, I must explain. You may be thinking to yourself why I gave it two stars and not one, if I’m complaining so much. Let me explain that two is pretty low on my scale. Two is “why did I buy this.” Or read this. Or whatever. One star is dramatic. One is “this should not have been written,” which I have given out as you may know. But no, I don’t believe that of Divergent. Roth has an interesting concept. It had potential. But it’s the execution of the idea that was just awful to me.I felt like I couldfeelwhat the author was thinking. Regardless of whether or not this is true, this is what I felt the author was saying to me through my copy of Divergent (minorish, and a few obvious spoilers to follow, major spoiler hidden under cut, you’ve been warned):Research? Lol who needs to do that to write a book? No Iknowhow to write a book, okay. I’ve read other books so I know.You know what was a good book? The Hunger Games. I liked Mockingjay as well, so I think I’m going to put them together and write a book just like that. Yea. Okay. Small petite girl, check. Dystopia, check. Living in an underground compound, check. Lessons about bravery and self-sacrifice, check. Small girl trains with other people who are jealous of her success, check. Kills people, check.Boyfriend gets programmed to hate her and tries to kill her, check.Good. I’ve got all the elements of a good book. I’ve even ended the last chapter with a train. Both The Hunger Games and Harry Potter did that. I’m going to be a YA legend.What’s cool? Jumping on a moving train. What else is cool? Jumping off a roof. Oh yea that sounds cool. I’ve seen that in a movie. Yea. What’s even cooler than that? ZIPLINING. I gotta think of more cool things, hold on. Gimme a second and I’ll come up with another.Omg this book took me a WHOLE month to write. That’s like an eternity. Okay publishing time.I’ve read that she did write it in a month. Whether it’s true or not, I'd certainly believe it in a heartbeat. The whole thing is rushed and just…completely nonsensical and full of trope after trope. It seemed to me that there was little effort put into analyzing the world and zero research done for it, which is a reminder to any of us who are writers to always have areasonfor something, and not just because it “sounds cool.” This book is a treasure trove of COOL PEOPLE tropes and activities. Which doesn’t seem to work on me as I really can’t stand that breed of thrill-seeking people who’d rather risk their life doing stupid shit instead of… you know, not. So what is supposed to be super awesomely cool people just, to me, looked like a band of idiots.Before I break it down, let’s get one thing out of the way. Wigs, did you like anything about the book though? Yes. Yes I did. Let’s talk about what did work for me:-Chapters 24 and 25. (lol, yes, out of the 39, I liked those two. She must have written those on a good night.) I feel like they kind of dropped all of the other outside nonsense and kind of focused on just human things. I think there’s a good writer in her, just not when she’s trying to be all dystopian and… cool.-Al’s storyline. And while Tris’s initial responses to Al made me rage, the story arc of Al really did move me emotionally and in a way that I was proud of Roth for doing so. Like cathartically I’m glad I felt these things over it.-Some of her little details were nice touches. I enjoyed this particular one where Four was under a blue spotlight in a dark hallway it she described how his eyes were black and shadowed while the rest of his face eerily lit (or something like that.) Just here and there were some bits of description I liked.And since I can’t think of anything else, let’s just move on. I like how it didn’t take me forever to read, but big font and spacing isn’t really a pro that counts for this.Jeez this is starting to turn into Divergent: The Review, a novel by Wigs. But oh well. You can stop at any time. But I can’t. Not yet. I have to get this out of my head.So here’s what I have issues with. And hey, if in book 2 she fixes some of these issues and answers some of the questions, great. I don’t care. Because someone can tell me “oh but we learn about that in book 2!” all they want but that doesn’t change the fact that after book 1 I’m thinking to myself “well that was completely stupid.” If you can’t convince me from book 1 to keep going then we’ve got a problem, right?So as you already probably know, this book is about this dystopian society that is divided up into five factions, based on personality traits, point being that you are assigned a career/lifestyle based on what you’re like. And that’s fine. I can believe that. I can believe that a dystopian society would force you into choosing a limited amount of careers based on what you excel in. My issue is that this society is completely dysfunctional. And I know that we’re supposed to be on the cusp of collapse and all, but there is a difference between dystopian and dysfunctional. A dystopian is scary for us, because ideally, it is supposed to be believable. We can believe The Hunger Games is possible because people would totally watch a reality show where people fight to the death. If you put that on tv right now, thousands, I’m sure, would watch it. In the case of Divergent, my issue is that this society is unbelievable. I’m not convinced that there was a way society could get to this point, because the details are so minimal and poorly thought out. Everything is very homogenized and simplified thusly into these factions and these careers (using the information given to us):Abnegation (selfless people): healthcare, politicsDauntless (brave people): guards, policeErudite (knowledgeable people): research, reporting (and one would guess teaching?)Amity (friendly people): farmingCandor (honest people): lawyers, and…?Okay so seriously what does Candor even do? 1/5 of this society is lawyers? I don’t think so. I would have thought they would have at least done news/newspapers but we’re told that it comes from Erudite so I don’t even know. They seem pointless. Anything I can think of that might go with them is really better suited to Erudite.And wait a minute. Healthcare is given to Abnegation? Wait really? Shouldn’t it be given to Erudite, since being in the medical field requires almost a decade of studying to learn how to do it? Or what, is it like homeopathic healthcare? How helpful.You CANNOT tell me that one faction rules the government. There is NO WAY that when they set up the system people were like you know what's a good idea? Putting one group in all the power. That's ridiculous to say that something like that happens in Future America. There's no way they wouldn't have put together a system where there is representation from each faction within a council. (Isn't that what the American Revolution was all about? Lack of representation in government? I cannot see everyone saying 'fuck representation! let's all agree to give the government over to theselflesspeople'....andlaterbeing like OH WHOOPS we don't like this!) So the whole main plot of Divergent is based on something that's already broken my suspension of belief.And what’s with everyone being white collar? And how blue collar jobs are for the factionless, which the author speaks of as if they’re on the same level as crazy homeless people. I sorely hope she doesn’t think that in real life. Tris speaks about them as if they’re pariahs. Construction workers, bus drivers, gasp, the horror. The villain wants to get rid of them. Oh yes. Oh yes. Get rid of your laborers, what villain who dreams of prosperity DOESN’T get rid of the laborers? Hahaha Roth you’re killing me.Okay, we need to talk about the train for a second. What. Is with. The Train. Why doesn’t it ever stop? (except for that one time when they rode it to the end of the city.) Why is this train an asshole? Didn’t jump on on time? Oops, you failed. Now you’re homeless. Loser. Oops, you fell off and now you’re dead. Lol we don’t stop the train here, bitch. Learn to live. (For a city that hasn’t seen murders in years, why does nobody give a shit when someone dies falling off the train? If random death isn’t common, why isn’t it horrifying? Why is everyone like just ignore it guys, just ignore it.) If it’s a Dauntless only train, why the fuck doesn’t it actually stop at the Dauntless compound. Oh yea because the Dauntless are stupid and have to make things ~death-defying.~ And how is it that the train tracks are both on the ground in front of the glass building and seven stories up at the roof of the glass building? I guess there’s two sets of tracks even though it wasn’t spoken about like that? Or otherwise the steepest track change in the world, haha.AND WHY DO THEY LIVE UNDERGROUND? WHY? They had perfectly good empty buildings to refurbish, and instead they spend however many millions of dollars digging a bigass hole in the middle of the city just so people can enjoy some nice sunlight-deprived living. OH NO IT’S JUST BECAUSE TRIS NEEDED TO JUMP OFF A ROOF INTO A BLACK HOLE. Yea okay now it all makes sense what a good idea I’m glad you came up with such a normal reason for an underground compound. Not like that they’re in hiding or privacy or anything sensical like that. Or maybe she just wanted to copy Mockingjay, that too, of course. I can’t forget that.You know, all of this could have made sense if she just didn’t make it set in our world. She could have chosen, say, a Miyazaki type world where there’s a magical train that doesn’t stop, and a place where the people all live underground, and whatever. But no, this is freakin’ future Chicago. And guess what people. In the future, the trains stop for no bitch, so watch out.Okay okay I could go on forever about all the stuff I hate but I’m just gonna harp on two more topics and call it quits.1)Why are the Dauntless so ridiculous? One thinks that a dystopian society would care about their military. Especially considering that in this case, their entire city is surrounded by a guarded fence with barbed wire. Clearly protection is important to them. So whyyyyyyy are the Dauntless, the only source of soldiers, completely undisciplined jackasses? They party it up and dress up like punks from 70s London and ….train to fight MMA style for whatever reason (It’s COOL, Wigs, gosh) but why are they completely out of control? They all act like they’re 15. Let’s sneak out at night and go do shit wooooo! Why aren’t the initiates sent immediately to bootcamp style training, like an actual military. Instead we’re gonna capture the flag and you know, camp activities mixed in with boy-on-girl fist-fighting and knife throwing. And mental training which, while cool (there’s that magic word again), seems to serve no real life application aside from the ridiculous circumstances Roth cooks up.You know what? We’re not going to kill you normally. We’re going to put you in a box full of water because we know you think about that in your worst nightmares. We already had this ready too, for whatever reason.2) And how, HOW,HOWis everyone not Divergent? Why does Tris have special snowflake syndrome? We’re told that being divergent is basically having a mind which is suitable for multiple factions, not just one single faction. Which is dangerous etc whatever. And I can buy that, I can, that a dystopian society would want to suppress an individual which has too many skills or whatever butttttt… how is it that SO few people actually have multiple skills. Seeing as things like selflessness and kindness go hand in hand, wouldn’t people be divergent for Abnegation and Amity? And wouldn’t people who speak their mind and are smart, a common pairing, be divergent for Candor and Erudite? And what about the people who’s tests tell them that they belong in one faction, but are allowed to choose another?? Why is that allowed, since it encourages them to learn more skills? (which is discouraged!) If they’re good at their chosen faction, and not the one that they were intended, doesn’t that make them divergent? And if they want to discourage people having multiple functions, why the hell are people allowed to change factions at all? Because if you’re raised one way and then learn a whole new way, aren’t you, in fact, becoming divergent by straddling the two worlds? It’s not like suddenly people forget everything, Christina still has her Candor traits even though she’s in Dauntless. I just don’t understand what seems to be this fatal flaw in Roth’s design. And because of this, I see how sad the wasted potential is. Why ISN’T everyone secretly divergent? Wouldn’t that actually be making a statement on the nature of humans and how you can’t suppress them into single pieces and put them in a box? But no, no, Tris has aspecialbrain. No one can get into her mind. Just like Bella Swan.Speaking of which, with Tris, who is supposed to be divergent for Abnegation and Dauntless, I can barely find any selflessness traits outside of a what any regular person would do. I found her, in fact, written incredibly selfish, as teenagers are. It seemed that Roth didn’t realize (or did she?) what a jerk she was writing Tris to be (omg why are my friends so jealous of me??? Omg he’s so gross but lol someone likes me that’s so cool.) She also has to point out physical features to add to why she doesn't like people (greasy hair, crooked teeth, stretch marks, pudge....didn't you know that all bad people are also ugly? Duh.)Ugh I’m sorry I’m going to stop talking, that is enough, Wigs. Basically it comes down to this. I didn’t buy 90% of the stuff I was being fed. Eye-rolling was induced many a time. The ending was just about every cliché from an action movie I could think of.AND WHY DID YOU KILL WILL? WHY? YOU SHOOT ERIC IN THE FOOT, PETER IN THE ARM, PEOPLE YOU HATE, BUT THEN WILL, ONE OF YOUR ONLY FRIENDS, IN THE HEAD? IT WASN’T EVEN A RAGE KILL. YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD US YOU AIMED AT HIS HEAD. RIGHT AFTER YOU SAID YOU KNEW IT WASN’T HIS FAULT. RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO WAKE UP ALL THE DAUNTLESS AS THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OH YEA THAT’S RIGHT WE NEEDED A KILL-YOUR-FRIEND SCENE. CUZ THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE STORIES, RIGHT?I’m sorry. I’m sorry everybody, for being a grump. But I just can’t with this. I can’t. I can’t deal. A book without a solid platform of sense is just not for me., error: What kind of ridiculous mess...Oh man.So I know I say this in dissenting opinion, as many on my friends list are partial to this book, but I could not stand it. So before I go off on my tirade, I must explain. You may be thinking to yourself why I gave it two stars and not one, if I’m complaining so much. Let me explain that two is pretty low on my scale.

And mental training which, while cool (there’s that magic word again), seems to serve no real life application aside from the ridiculous circumstances Roth cooks up.You know what? We’re not going to kill you normally. We’re going to put you in a box full of water because we know you think about that in your worst nightmares. We already had this ready too, for whatever reason.2) And how, HOW,HOWis everyone not Divergent? Why does Tris have special snowflake syndrome? We’re told that being divergent is basically having a mind which is suitable for multiple factions, not just one single faction. Which is dangerous etc whatever. And I can buy that, I can, that a dystopian society would want to suppress an individual which has too many skills or whatever butttttt… how is it that SO few people actually have multiple skills. Seeing as things like selflessness and kindness go hand in hand, wouldn’t people be divergent for Abnegation and Amity? And wouldn’t people who speak their mind and are smart, a common pairing, be divergent for Candor and Erudite? And what about the people who’s tests tell them that they belong in one faction, but are allowed to choose another?? Why is that allowed, since it encourages them to learn more skills? (which is discouraged!) If they’re good at their chosen faction, and not the one that they were intended, doesn’t that make them divergent? And if they want to discourage people having multiple functions, why the hell are people allowed to change factions at all? Because if you’re raised one way and then learn a whole new way, aren’t you, in fact, becoming divergent by straddling the two worlds? It’s not like suddenly people forget everything, Christina still has her Candor traits even though she’s in Dauntless. I just don’t understand what seems to be this fatal flaw in Roth’s design. And because of this, I see how sad the wasted potential is. Why ISN’T everyone secretly divergent? Wouldn’t that actually be making a statement on the nature of humans and how you can’t suppress them into single pieces and put them in a box? But no, no, Tris has aspecialbrain. No one can get into her mind. Just like Bella Swan.Speaking of which, with Tris, who is supposed to be divergent for Abnegation and Dauntless, I can barely find any selflessness traits outside of a what any regular person would do. I found her, in fact, written incredibly selfish, as teenagers are. It seemed that Roth didn’t realize (or did she?) what a jerk she was writing Tris to be (omg why are my friends so jealous of me??? Omg he’s so gross but lol someone likes me that’s so cool.) She also has to point out physical features to add to why she doesn't like people (greasy hair, crooked teeth, stretch marks, pudge....didn't you know that all bad people are also ugly? Duh.)Ugh I’m sorry I’m going to stop talking, that is enough, Wigs. Basically it comes down to this. I didn’t buy 90% of the stuff I was being fed. Eye-rolling was induced many a time. The ending was just about every cliché from an action movie I could think of.AND WHY DID YOU KILL WILL? WHY? YOU SHOOT ERIC IN THE FOOT, PETER IN THE ARM, PEOPLE YOU HATE, BUT THEN WILL, ONE OF YOUR ONLY FRIENDS, IN THE HEAD? IT WASN’T EVEN A RAGE KILL. YOU SPECIFICALLY TOLD US YOU AIMED AT HIS HEAD. RIGHT AFTER YOU SAID YOU KNEW IT WASN’T HIS FAULT. RIGHT BEFORE YOU SAID YOU NEEDED TO WAKE UP ALL THE DAUNTLESS AS THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OH YEA THAT’S RIGHT WE NEEDED A KILL-YOUR-FRIEND SCENE. CUZ THAT’S WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE STORIES, RIGHT?I’m sorry. I’m sorry everybody, for being a grump. But I just can’t with this. I can’t. I can’t deal. A book without a solid platform of sense is just not for me. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

It has everything that they like: Cold leader who excels ateverything, even when she doesn't try. Violence and gore at every turn. Oppressive society. Tattoos. Injuries that come and go as they please. Etc, etc, etc.Hmmm, where to start?? To start? To start? Haha, ring a bell? It does. It does. It does. I am brave! I am Dauntless!Ok, I'll get serious now. Simply put, I did not like this book. I tried to like it. I wanted to give up but kept on reading and really I don't think it was worth it. I see from the ratings that a lot of people liked it but I didn't. The beginning of the book starts off like Matched. It is slow, we are presented with a brother and sister the day before some type of choosing ceremony.I did not get the whole Dauntless thing. What was the point of them? Seems like the only thing they did were stunts and have fun. There were no wars, so why all the fighting? We meet some people guarding a fence (that I am still clueless about), but apparently said guard duty is a job that is kind of like punishment. So what did they do?There was so much senseless violence! And I am not usually one to complain about it but golly (ha, I said golly), at least inthe other bookit is very necessary for survival. In this one it is just there because I don't know why.The Faction world is kind of clear. We don't know a lot of details of the world outside of Chicago. What happened to everything? I still don't have a clear mental picture of that dang Dauntless compound! And like Tris, I too wondered where that train was coming from and going to!I didn't like Tris in the beginning. I wanted to. I tried to. But she really sounded like a robot! I felt like I was listening to the thoughts of a robot. All she did was tell me her observations in sentence structured like no real human would talk like. Ididlike the part where she was complimented. And the part where she wasn't sure if she should be jealous or not. I thought her reactions were sweet and it made me grin. She grew on me as the book went on but I did not see us as friends.Tris was good at everything she did. It got to the point that her being the best just wasn't even surprising. I mean, I didn't even need details anymore since she always came out on top.The romance between her and that boy with the horrible real name (for the book) was unbelievable and forced. It made me feel awkward. Like I'd overstayed my welcome. Like I was too nice to say goodbye and they'd forgotten I was there. That awkward. Personally, I think the relationship needs to be nixed as slapping and cutting each other is not healthy. And not cool, not cool at all!There is some good though. There isn't really a boring moment in the book. The action is nonstop. Anywho, you should still read it because everyone else liked it and we can compare notes when you're done!A few observations:1. Tattoos heal really fast and don't bother you (unless it's convenient).2. Repeating things three times is better than saying it once. That way we canget it.3.Being shot in the arm won't bother you. You can do pretty much anything because the bullet wound only makes you slightly dizzy. You only grimace when you remember. In paranormal books the hot alpha shifter gets shot and cut then wipes off the blood and laughs. Guess what? In this book the human girl gets shot and goes with the flow. I was beginning to think that the author was lying to me. Is reacting considered selfishness in Abnegation? Was she even a human? Or, was she the robot that I suspected??4. Gunshots don't hurt you but it sure as hecky hurts your enemy. Also, it's ridiculous to expect said enemy to walk when he's been shot.5. For people that have been raised around nothing but selflessness, seeing someone getting a bullet removed from their shoulder, with a knife, is not as bad as you think. It's apparently the same as watching fresh bread being pulled out of the oven. Exactly.6. Having your mom AND dad being murdered in front of you is no biggie. That's what being Dauntless is about. It's like having your souffle fall. It kind of sucks, but whatevs!7. It's totally fine to (in the same conversation) to mention to someone that, “woah, your parents have been murdered” and in the next few sentences say, “this might be a bad time, but I am in love with you”.

It tried to be epic and it tried to be a classic but it failed so badly. The characters weren't well fleshed-out, it was obvious that the Good people (Sayuri, Mahema) would triumph over the Bad (Hatsumomo), it was obvious that Sayuri would get her happy ending after all..See, all throughout the book, I was completely disconnected, I didn'tfeelanything. I didn't smile, or laugh, I certainly didn't cry. I can't even say I'm angry or that Ihatethe book - because hatred requires that I care, and I don't. I'm just... indifferent. Bored. Unimpressed.

It tried to be epic and it tried to be a classic but it failed so badly. The characters weren't well fleshed-out, it was obvious that the Good people (Sayuri, Mahema) would triumph over the Bad (Hatsumomo), it was obvious that Sayuri would get her happy ending after all..See, all throughout the book, I was completely disconnected, I didn'tfeelanything. I didn't smile, or laugh, I certainly didn't cry. I can't even say I'm angry or that Ihatethe book - because hatred requires that I care, and I don't. I'm just... indifferent. Bored. Unimpressed. And isn't it the worst state of mind you can possibly be in after you finish a book? Ultimately, it didn't leave a mark.So the book as a whole was a major disappointment and I'm glad it's over. I just hope the movie might be better - I kept thinking it would be better to watch it, seeing how graphic the descriptions were (of the kimonos, for example). [Edit: So I saw the movie. Meeeh.]But as a book, it was unconvincing and very flawed. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

It deals in big, bold pronouncements of 'follow your dreams' et cetera et cetera, and it certainly makes you think about your own life and the pursuit of your own \"Personal Legend\" if you will. But maybe I'm older and more cynical now, or maybe it's not cynicism so much as just seeing a reality that isn't so mystical and black and white as Paulo Coelho's, but in any event, I just wasn't buying what 'The Alchemist' was selling.It's a good, quick read, I'll give it that. I enjoyed myself, and I definitely thought a little bit about my own life in the process, which I appreciate from my literature. And while I was more or less with it for a while, I just couldn't stay on board with an ending that left me saying, \"that's it? Really?\"Be forewarned, there will be spoilers after this point. The whole book Santiago is in pursuit of his \"Personal Legend\", which he is told is a great treasure found in the pyramids of Egypt. Along the way he befriends many people and makes a great sum of money, while also meeting a beautiful young woman who agrees to more or less be his life-partner,Romeo and Juliet-style (which is stupid in and of itself, but more on that later). It is at this point that he determines he has achieved a greater treasure than any he had ever dreamed of, and would go no further. Beautiful. Cue the music and themes of recognizing treasure in all its forms. Santiago has a wonderful, fulfilling life laid out before him, and would most likely die a happy man by the side of his lovely wife and adoring children, all while living comfortably as village counselor of a beautiful desert oasis. Sounds pretty nice, no?Well, that's where the book lost it's footing. Santiago is urged, coerced even, into continuing to follow his \"Personal Legend\", leaving behind his \"love\" (who, it should be mentioned is a \"woman of the desert\" and so is completely fine being abandoned by her \"love\" and will simply wait and wait and wait for him, whether he ever returns or not) traversing the desert and (bizarrely) evading a hostile army along the way by turning himself into the wind (it makes about as much sense as it sounds). In the end though, Coelho reveals to us that Santiago does, indeed, reach his \"Personal Legend\" in a two and a half page epilogue, where it is shoddily revealed that Santiago's long-sought after treasure is...treasure. Literally. Buried treasure. A box in the sand filled with gold coins and diamonds and jewelry and crowns, and all the other cliche treasure images you can think up. What the hell?So what message are we supposed to take from this book then? Money is the most important thing in the world? Women are objects meant to be seen and valued for their beauty, there to serve you and wait around forever while you go on wild goose chases across continents in search of money?Obviously I'm being facetious, and Coelho intended to say that one should follow their dreams no matter what, even if it transcends a nice, content life, so long as you are in pursuit of a life that would be even greater than you can ever imagine, sacrificing what is good now for what can be great later. But he did so in an extremely simplistic way, and the revelation of the Santiago's treasure being literally treasure was a major disappointment.The thing was, despite his simplicity, the book had a nice message going for a while. If Fatima was Santiago's treasure, that I could have gotten behind, even if it shows a good deal of contempt for the role of women in relationships (beauty being the most important factor in deciding on a mate, as Santiago is struck by her beauty and immediately professes his love; Fatima more or less acquiesces immediately and pledges herself to Santiago no matter what, even if he must travel the desert forever in selfish pursuit of his own dreams, with no regard for her), because that is something intangible that is meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of financial standing. But then Coelho basically goes on to say that that is just a roadblock in the way of real achievement, and that one should selfishly pursue their own dreams with no regard for those closest to them.How a book can go on and on talking about seeing the everyday symbols and omens in life and taking heed of them, presumably leaving metaphors for life all along the way, and then have what was presumably the biggest metaphor of them all, Santiago's treasure, turn out not to be a metaphor at all, but just money? To me, that summed up everything. I suppose Coelho realizes this, as he begins the book with a brief fable about Narcissus falling into the river because he loved staring at his reflection, and the river's disappointment in this, as the river loved gazing into Narcissus's eyes and seeing the reflection of itself. This is a horrible little story implying that everyone is obsessed only with themselves, a sad, empty little thought that Coelho spends 167 pages endorsing wholeheartedly, under the guise of following your dreams.I understand that other people love this book and find it inspiring, and I think I would have felt the same way years ago, when I was just out of college and it appeared I had my whole life ahead of me and a lifetime to live it. I'm older now, and I've found someone who I consider to be a real treasure, and while I still have dreams, I'm not willing to sacrifice the happiness that this life brings me every day in a single-minded pursuit of something that I want for selfish reasons (fame, fortune, etc.). If I was Santiago, I would have never left Fatima in the first place if she truly made me happy, as Santiago claimed she did. Perhaps that makes me a coward in Coelho's eyes, not unlike the Crystal merchant from the story. But it'd also make menotthe sad Englishman, whose single-minded pursuit of his \"personal legend\" had cost him all his money, friends, and family and left him alone in an oasis burning lead in a tent in the vain hopes it will turn to gold.I guess what I'm trying to say in this long-winded review, is that this book is all about being selfish and doing what you think will make you happy, regardless of everything else. I can see why that appeals to people, especially those who want to show the doubters and find their own treasure beneath a sycamore tree, but it's sad, in a way. We live in a culture where everyone wants selfish things like fame or money or power, just to satisfy some gaping hole in their own souls, ignoring the real problems that lead to these compulsions in the first place.

Whoever the ghost writer is for Donald Trump books12. AlchemistJokes aside,The Alchemistby Paulo Coelho is an endlessly quotable book. It reads like a fable, with very catchy and accessible writing that is meant to empower and make you feel good. This really works for a lot of people—I mean this was awidelysuccessful novel—and I’m happy that so many people could be moved and inspired by a book. Especially a book that unites people around the world by being an international success. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it all comes across as a pristine facade without much behind it, offering something that can be quickly digested but isn’t actually filling. This is a book that I recall enjoying enough when I read it as a teen but haven’t thought of since, so when someone picked it as our next read for our book club I was excited to revisit it seeing as I remembered literally nothing about it. I hate to say it, but being fun but forgettable is my takeaway from it again.‘There is only one way to learn... It's through action.’Coelho said the book was written very quickly because ‘the book was already written in my soul,’ and in the forward he discusses how this novel was his own Personal Legend. ‘I was living my own metaphor,’ he said, being thrilled just to get it picked up by a Brazilian publisher who, in 1988, only ran 900 copies assuming it would not be a big success. The book ended up taking off, with the 1993 English translation becoming a massive hit and lead to numerous further translations. Coelho even holds a Guinness World Record for “most translations of a single title signed by the author in 1 sitting”, signing his book in 53 different translated editions at a book event in Germany. So I can really appreciate that aspect, and his own personal journey into publishing and believing in himself is honestly better than the book itself.Fun fact: The Alchemist had a big boost in sales when then-President Bill Clinton was photographed reading it.For those who don’t know, the story follows a young boy, Santiago, as he journeys across the desert and meets a lot of interesting people along the way. Literally every person has a pearl of positive wisdom to share it seems, and it becomes a rapid fire of empowerment quotes that could all go on one of those inspirational posters made for office walls in the 90s. Actually, I’m fairly certain I’ve seen one that quoted this book. The characters all feel like a mouthpiece for Coehlo to pass along his positive message, or wisdom, and one can easily imagine this being a self-help book had he not decided to attach a fictional narrative to it. It is a nice message, that you have to believe in yourself and in your goals and, if you truly do (“only those who are true of heart” vibes like in fairy tales) the universe will conspire to help you achieve your goal. Which is a nice inspirational message and sometimes that is what you need to hear to break free from self doubt. Particularly as another primary message is that we must overcome fear to accomplish what we need to do. ‘Don't give in to your fears,’ Coelho writes, ‘If you do, you won't be able to talk to your heart.’ So great, yea, believe in yourself. I dig that.‘To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation.’I do, however, see it as a bit of a back-patting perspective. Like yes, if you are successful it is nice to feel like it is because you are pure of heart. He tells us that those who don’t follow their dreams end up in ruin and sadness. This is sort of a success fallacy in a way, as it implies that if things are bad its because you just didn’t try hard enough. Which…ehhhhh…I mean there are a lot of forces acting in society that gatekeep and sometimes it’s more than just not overcoming adversity. And I get it, keep trying, yea, but it feels a bit like shaming? Which is honestly overthinking it though as this book is not that nuanced or deep (something I kept saying during debates over minor details during book club: “I don’t think he even considered that and its beside the point because it’s not actually that deep”). It is meant to be a fun and empowering story that paints in broad strokes and yea, I get why it means a lot to many people. For me it just seemed a bit flat and like a snack when I wanted a meal.‘Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.’Okay, fine, I don’t know how to write a good book or how to live my life either, but I just know this one wasn’t it for me.I did appreciate how it was aimed at a general positive idea of spirituality that, while using different religions, was not necessarily religious. Spiritual, or mystic would seem the better term. I liked the idea of the universe, the sand, the wind, etc as conscious entities that can collaborate with you. While I really disliked the deus ex machina ending, the whole idea of the world as a spiritual presence was well done. Coelho does sort of pull an orientalism in his depiction as an outsider of the region as this wild and savage land full of wise sages and cutthroat robbers, but it does seem with the aim of capturing the feel ofOne Thousand and One Nightsor other tales of adventure and ‘finding yourself’ in exotic locale. Which I think is a topic that people have had a more nuanced discussion on since this book was written.‘It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting,’ Coelho writes, and this I can agree with. However, inThe Alchemist, the general tone of the book is that dreams seem a thing only for men. Fatima, Santiago’s love interest, lacks much agency in the tale and is more or less written as a prize for following his Personal Legend. She is an element of his journey, while I guess he is all her journey gets to be. He tells her ‘I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you,’ which…isn’t all that romantic or great? Hey, the universe popped you into my life, guess you’ll do for a bride. C’mon, man, does she have any personality or intelligence you enjoy and don’t just tell me how beautiful she is. Didn’t vibe with any of that aspect of the book.I also didn’t really like the ending. Sure it is riffing on the whole “it’s the journey not the destination” aspect but it felt a bit flat for me with the deus ex machina moment. It is a happy ending though, and one full of success and rewards. As a bookclub member pointed out, it sort of resonates with a quote byT.S. Eliot: ‘We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.’So in the end, I’m mostly ambivalent to this book. I see why people enjoy it and it is admittedly pretty and sweet and uplifting. It’s a good vibe to be in.

So here's how they all played out in my head:Simon - Aaron Taylor-JohnsonFor some reason, I always imagined Simon as young Eisenheim. And a part of me wants to kick myself for associating the 2006 film with this book in any way.Alec - Ezra MillerAnd no, it'snotbecause he's queer.Isabelle - Jessica SzohrBecause I wanted to put this picture in here, 'kay?Jace - Draco MalfoyI mean come on.

All I know is that she pretty much copy-pasted whole wads of text from another FF writer, from published books, from TV dialogue - into herDraco Dormienstrilogy, without providing any credit to the original authors.I also know that she lifted wads of text fromDraco Dormiensinto her publishedMortal Instruments. What remains a mystery, though, is whetherthesebits copied intoThe Mortal Instrumentswere her own original pieces of writing, or some of them even plagiarized work?I won't go much into the whole plagiarism thing, since if indeed any plagiarized work exists inThe Mortal Instruments, that is pretty much speculation.However, it does bring to mind questions of ethic;should a plagiarist be published?Some people strongly believe in giving second chances. I think people only deserve second chances when theyadmitto their errors and have truly proven their repentance. Both cases which I have not as of yet heardCassandra Claredo.Other questions popping into my head includeshouldn't there be some sort of punishment for plagiarists?!I mean, if I did in university whatCassandra Claredid inDraco Dormiens(and, arguably,The Mortal Instruments), then I would've been kicked out on the curb and my pretty Master's degree ripped to shreds. And, similar to the wholeChris Browndebacle, instead of condemning her far below ethical work habits, we, the consumers, commend their \"artwork\", as if sending the message that whatever wrongs they have done, it doesn't matter because people still eat their shit up. There is no learning curve here; or at least, no deterrence factor.But anyway, I tried to suppress these nagging questions while I read the book, because I wanted to know if I would truly,objectively, enjoyCity of Bones. Especially after the whole \"GR Bullies\" absurdity, where an increasing number of voices proclaim thatReviews Should Be About Books And Completely Separate From The Author.Well, ladies and gentlemen, my experience readingCity of Boneswill provide evidence (alongside many other ample evidence out there), that no -sometimeswe, as readers, cannot keep the two things separate.Sometimes, our moral and ethic code just won't let us. Reading is, after all, a subjective experience, andall sorts of thingsinfluence our enjoyment of it, including our perception of the author. And if that affects our enjoyment of a book, then it damn welldoesbelong in a review if we choose to put it there.So. Anyway. Now that I'm off my soapbox. The biggest thing that stands out while I readCity of Boneswashow inconsistent the writing was. It was so lazy and repetitive, information was handed over to us on a silver platter - there was no subtlety or any depth going on. But then there would be brief, short scenes or dialogues thatactually made me laugh out. Those few and interspersed scenes surprised me, like one wet and icky autumn day, when I found a five dollar bill while raking up my neighbour's filthy garden.Try as I might to ignore it, I was at a dilemma.Should I enjoy this?I mean, it's only five dollars. Surely they couldn't miss it. And, I mean, I'm working myarseoff in this horrible weather because mymotherowes them a lawnmower. And anyway, it might not evenbetheirs to begin with.In the end, I took the money (come on, you would've, too!), but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I would have. And thedelightI should have felt atfinding moneyjust wasn't there.These funny bits of dialogues and scenes filled me with just as much inner turmoil as my five-dollar-note dilemma, and even though Iknowthat maybe, perhaps, it could be that these are allCassandra Clare's own words, I still couldn't shake off the icky suspicions out off my gut - did she \"draw inspiration\" from some other unknown source, here?In the end, it just ravaged me with too much guilt and suspicions that what originally would have been a five-star scene was reduced down to three stars and a really, really sad face.Also a part of the inconsistent writing, was theinconsistent narration. I know 3rd person omniscient gives the narrator the power to sift through characters' thoughts and emotions as they please, but this is what made the narrative sound forced and contrived. We would normally follow Clary as the novel progresses - until it is convenient for us to see things from another character's perspective, in which case off we'll jump into another person's head.Theseconveniencesare justoneexample of what I mean when I say thatthe narrative lacked subtlety. When we aren't directly being fed a certain character's thoughts and emotions through his/her own point of view, we are blatantlytoldtheir feelings by the character themselves. Rarely are people in real life so honest andself-awareas the characters inCity of Bones.\"An asshat?\" Jace looked as if he were about to laugh.\"What you said to Simon--\"\"I was trying to save him some pain. Isabelle will cut out his heart and walk all over it in high-heeled boots. That's what she does to boys like that.\"*\"(...) You want to know what it's like when your parents are good church-going folk and you happen to be born with the devil's mark?\" He pointed at his eyes, fingers splayed. \"When your father flinches at the sight of you and your mother hangs herself in the barn, driven mad by what she's done? When I was ten, my father tried to drown me in the creek. I lashed out at him with everything I had--burned him with everything I had--burned him where he stood. (...)\"*\"I didn't think you liked me all that much.\"Isabelle's brightness faded and she looked down at her silvery toes. \"I didn't think I did either,\" she admitted. \"But when I went to look for and Jace, and you were gone...\" Her voice trailed off, \"I wasn't just worried about him, I was worried about you, too. There's something so ... reassuring about you. And Jace is so much better when you're around.\"The point I'm trying to make, here, is that we get to know the characters becauseother characters are constantly telling us about them, instead of us making our own informed opinions of them based on their actions and words. This is why I saythe writing was lazy and lacked depth. And howCassandra Claretried to show us that her characters have background and troubles and areoh such damaged goodswas more or less through self-testimonials such as the second quote up above, where Magnus Bane so conveniently gave away his entire childhood to three random teenagers. The chapterThe Werewolf's Talewas another one of these self-testimonials for another partially-important character.This is a whole new level of telling-instead-of-showing.Where unimaginative writers just unload all these information through descriptive prose,Cassandra Clarewas at least creative enough to hide it into her dialogue. But the same underlying problem is still there - weseenone of this \"damaged goods\". I didn't needSweeney Toddto tell me his past to know that he was a damaged, troubled man. Hisactionsspoke it for me.As forinformation being handed to us on a silver platter-- all you need to do is take a look at the entire ending scene with Valentine to see my point. The whole chapter was an infodump session. Rarely do I read villains who are so eager to reveal their past and provide explanations to their potential victims. TheHarry Potternovels were slightly guilty of this - especially in the earlier books - but I believe a lot of other things about the books redeemed itself from this one fault.Jace was also a bit of an infodumper, but I don't take away points for this. I mean, I get it - it's hard to get on withoutonecharacter at least explaining what the blazes was going on.Speaking ofcharacters... this is rather tough.Many reviewers despised Jace because he was such an asshole.Clary herself accuses Jace of being an asshole plenty of times. But I've lived a fair amount of years, and I was friendly with quite a few assholes during my own teenage years. And let me tell you one thing: Jace is no asshole. He's a guy with daddy issues, trying to act tough. Andthatis as deep as any of the characters get. I guess, he would be my favourite character out of the whole lot - notmy favourite characteras in the one I liked the most, but the character whom, in my opinion, was the most developed, withoutself-testimonialsorother characterstelling us about him.But remember my five-dollar-note dilemma? Yeah. Jace was, without a doubt, a direct cut-and-paste of theDracofromClare'sDraco Dormienstrilogy - who, by default, is a creation ofJK Rowling's. So forgive me if I\"can't separate the book from the author\"because frankly? If I enjoyed this book simply because of Jace, that doesn't say much about the rest of the book, or the quality of writing, because Jace is not evenClare's original character.Further illustrating theinconsistenciesofClare's writing, though, was thesudden and drastic change in Jace's characterduring the scene with Valentine. There is no way one person, in such a short amount of time, could thoroughly convince and change Jace into such an ... obedient? passive? receptive? character. No matterwhothe person claimed he was, orwhatevidence he brings to the table. Even if Jace believed in everything Valentine told him, there isno wayit would have drastically changed him in such a manner and such a short time.Just as unlikely, was the way Jace was ready to walk the ends of the world with Valentine, build a new life with him, and in the next moment - after a few words from Clary - was ready to throw that all away once again.Thedouble inconsistenciesastound me.Claresimply does not understand human psychology or even humannatureenough to make solid characters.The other characters were forgettable,to say the least. They all sounded the same, I'm afraid. Witty, dry sort of humour. It gets tiring after a while. Also, the Magnus-and-Alec thing? Can I just say,ew? Magnus is like, what? Forty? And Alec is ... sixteen?Even Valentine the Villain was ...not much of a villain.He didn't frighten me, or evendauntme. I kept reading how Clary was disgusted at howmanipulativehe was during his scenes, but reading the pages myself, reading his words, his actions? He wasn't particular conniving or ingenious - really, it was just that Jace was so ready to have a family back, he was willing to lap up every bit of contradicting information he heard.Plot progression and twists were unsurprising.Uninspired. No, wait, theywereinspired. ByStar WarsandHarry Potter, to name a few. Perhaps even a bit ofBuffyin there.And this is where my final dilemma lies.To like, or not to like? That is the question.For light fluff, it has entertainment value enough. Butwhat little entertainment value therewas, was lifted off other, better, pieces of workout there. To say that I did not enjoyCity of Boneswould be a lie; but the question is, did I enjoyCity of Bones, or did I enjoy the bits ofHarry PotterandStar WarsinCity of Bones?I'll let you decide if it's fine to like a book filled with other writers' characters, other authors' plot twists, other screenwriters' dialogue. Perhaps I'm being too uptight, but here's how I see it. New York with Potterverse and Star Wars. Take that away and what are you?, error: 19 Apr '16Bet you're sick of my updates, now.Just for reference, on the recent Sherrilyn Kenyon v Cassandra Clare.Kenyon hasfiled a lawsuitagainst Clare, and also provides alist of alleged similaritiesbetween Clare's work to her own.Read and decide for yourself.15 Jun '13update again!Saw some stills for the movie, and to be honest, despite being slightly spurious in my \"casting\" ofCity of Bones, I actually think my version is much better than the movie version.I mean, look at Isabelle, and look at Clary.Correct me if I'm wrong, but Isabelle is supposed to bewayhotter than Clary.And don't even get me started on Jace.I mean, Jamie Campbell Bower was cute in a couple of his other films, but.... Jace was supposed to be..... I dunno... swoon-on-your-feet-panty-wettinghawwwt.And Simon.....I mean, he has \"friendzone\" written all over him.12 Jan '13I know this is now being made into a film, and Iknowthey've all got the cast sorted out, but I imagined them very differently. So here's how they all played out in my head:Simon - Aaron Taylor-JohnsonFor some reason, I always imagined Simon as young Eisenheim. And a part of me wants to kick myself for associating the 2006 film with this book in any way.Alec - Ezra MillerAnd no, it'snotbecause he's queer.Isabelle - Jessica SzohrBecause I wanted to put this picture in here, 'kay?Jace - Draco MalfoyI mean come on. Is there even a debate on this??Clary - Kristen StewartOnly because her acting skills match the quality of Clary's personality.11 Aug '12Also known asWhy Readers CAN Review An Author As Well As His/Her Book, And Why STGRB Are Full of Shit And Obviously Never Took English Lit Classes For Telling Us We're Not Allowed To.I heard aboutthe whole plagiarism issuelong before I even heard ofCassandra Clare's books, so I tried getting into it as objective as possible, given the circumstances. All I know is that she pretty much copy-pasted whole wads of text from another FF writer, from published books, from TV dialogue - into herDraco Dormienstrilogy, without providing any credit to the original authors.I also know that she lifted wads of text fromDraco Dormiensinto her publishedMortal Instruments. What remains a mystery, though, is whetherthesebits copied intoThe Mortal Instrumentswere her own original pieces of writing, or some of them even plagiarized work?I won't go much into the whole plagiarism thing, since if indeed any plagiarized work exists inThe Mortal Instruments, that is pretty much speculation.However, it does bring to mind questions of ethic;should a plagiarist be published?Some people strongly believe in giving second chances.

And, similar to the wholeChris Browndebacle, instead of condemning her far below ethical work habits, we, the consumers, commend their \"artwork\", as if sending the message that whatever wrongs they have done, it doesn't matter because people still eat their shit up.

            "Translation failed for: As I write this review, the year is 2012. We do not live in a perfect world; in fact, in many ways we don't even live in a good world. But one thing I believe with all my heart is that we live in a world which, on the whole, is better than it was fifty years ago. Now, I know I'm writing with limited perspective and that progression and development hasn't been the same all over the globe and even the definition of those words can change depending on what part of the world you live in. But here's what I do know: the average world life expectancy is higher, the infant mortality rate is lower, access to education is greater and the amount of countries that hold regular, fair elections has increased.On average, people today are smarter than they were fifty years ago. And I know this is where older generations throw up their hands in indignation and start yelling about how exams were much harder in \"their day\" and they really had to work for it. I am not disputing this, I have no idea if it's true or not. But what is true is that more people today than ever before are going on to further education after high school, the barriers that once stopped the working class from being as smart as society's more privileged members are slowly starting to break down bit by bit. Literacy rates have been on the rise the whole world over:It's true. We have entered the age of computers and electronics, social networking and personal media players... and the world has not ended, the robots haven't taken over and people haven't become so stupid that they feel the need to rage a war against books. And this is the main reason why I think Bradbury's dystopian tale is out of date and ineffective. The author was writing at a time when technology was really starting to get funky, the digital age was still decades away but people were doing all kinds of crazy things like listening to music with little cones plugged into their ears. Bizarre.Readers often choose to view Bradbury's story as one about censorship instead of technology because that allows a more modern reader to connect with the world portrayed. But taken as it was intended, I just don't share the author's sentiments. Not all technology is good, but I'm of the opinion that the good outweighs the bad: medical advancements, entertainment, access to information via the internet... I'm the very opposite of a technophobe because, in my opinion, forward is the way to go. And I'm sure it's because of the age I was born into, but I cannot relate to the apprehension that Bradbury feels when he tells of this true story (note: this is not in the book):\"In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451 I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.\"I know many still think today that we are becoming a completely unsociable species because of mobile/cell phones, social networking sites, etc. but I have made friends from all over the world thanks to technology. I have talked to people that fifty years ago I would never have known, I have learned about different cultures and ways of life because I have access to most areas of the world through the web. So, no, I'm not scared of this so-called technological threat that is somehow going to turn our brains to mush and create a society where we cannot concentrate long enough to read a book. And here is where I (finally) get on to details of this novel.What I am supposed to believe in here is that - because of technology - humanity has become so stupid that they couldn't concentrate on books. So books were simplified at first for easier understanding, then banned, then burnt. Why? I am okay with the realistic aspect of \"people have short attention spans because of technology so they don't want to read books\", but why burn books? I don't see why this would need to happen and why it would become a criminal offense to have books in your home. This is where I understand why so many people prefer to apply this novel's message to censorship, because it works so much better that way. The argument for the technological side of it is weak - even for the time in question.The best thing about this whole book is the discussion about the phoenix and the comparisons made between the legendary bird and humanity: in the same way that the bird dies in flames only to be reborn again from the ashes, humanity constantly repeats mistakes made throughout history and never seems to learn from them. Secondly, to give credit where it's due, the writing is suitably creepy for a dystopian society and I understand why people who do actually share Bradbury's concerns would be caught up in the novel's atmosphere. But, overall, this wasn't a great dystopian work for me, I didn't agree with the point it was trying to sell me and I don't think it made a very successful case for it. Furthermore, I had some problems with the pacing. The book is split into three parts and the first two are much slower and uneventful than the last one - which seems to explode with a fast sequence of events in a short amount of time and pages.

But, overall, this wasn't a great dystopian work for me, I didn't agree with the point it was trying to sell me and I don't think it made a very successful case for it. Furthermore, I had some problems with the pacing. The book is split into three parts and the first two are much slower and uneventful than the last one - which seems to explode with a fast sequence of events in a short amount of time and pages. Disappointing. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: I read the end of The Catcher in the Rye the other day and found myself wanting to take Holden Caulfield by the collar and shake him really, really hard and shout at him to grow up. I suppose I've understood for some time now that The Catcher in the Rye -- a favorite of mine when I was sixteen -- was a favorite precisely because I was sixteen. At sixteen, I found Holden Caulfield's crisis profoundly moving; I admired his searing indictment of society, his acute understanding of human nature, his extraordinary sensitivity (I mean, come on, he had a nervous breakdown for God's sake, he had to be sensitive). At sixteen, I wanted to marry Holden Caulfield. At forty, I want to spank him. After all, Holden's indictment of society boils down to the \"insight\" that everybody is a phony. That's the kind of insight a sixteen year old considers deep. A forty year old of the grown-up variety recognizes Holden's insight as superficial and banal, indulging in the cheapest kind of adolescent posturing. It suggests a grasp of society and of human nature that's about as complex as an episode of Dawson's Creek. Holden and his adolescent peers typically behave as though the fate they have suffered (disillusionment and the end of innocence) is unique in human history. He can't see beyond the spectacle of his own disillusionment (and neither can J. D. Salinger); for all his painful self-consciousness, Holden Caulfield is not really self-aware. He can't see that he himself is a phony.Compare Salinger's novel of arrested development, for instance, with a real bildungsroman, Great Expectations. Holden Caulfield is an adolescent reflecting on childhood and adolescence; Pip Pirrip is an adult reflecting on childhood and adolescence. Holden Caulfield has the tunnel vision of teendom, and he depicts events with an immediacy and absorption in the experience that blocks out the broader context, the larger view. Pip Pirrip has the wonderful double vision of a sensitive adult recollecting the sensitive child he used to be; he conveys at the same time the child's compelling perspective and the adult's thoughtful revision of events. While Holden Caulfield litters his narrative with indignant exposes of phonies and frauds, Pip Pirrip skillfully concentrates on \"the spurious coin of his own make\" -- that is, without letting the child Pip and the adolescent Pip in on the joke, he exposes himself as a phony. Pip Pirrip grows up. Holden Caulfield has a nervous breakdown.I suppose the only reason I begrudge him his breakdown is that so many in our culture -- many more, unfortunately, than just the legitimate adolescents among us -- seem fixated on Holden as a symbol of honesty and socially-liberating rebellion. We view nervous collapse and dysfunction as a badge of honor, a sign -- to put it in Caulfieldian terms -- that we are discerning enough to see through all the crap. Our celebration of overwrought disaffection reminds me of the last sentence of Joyce’s Araby: “Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.” Here is the adolescent pose non-pareil. Equally self-accusing and self-aggrandizing, it captures the adolescent at the precise moment when his own disillusionment becomes the object of his grandiose and self-dramatizing vision. That’s the kind of crap that Holden Caulfield (and J. D. Salinger) cannot see through. And it is often the kind of crap that we “adults” like to slosh around in.The Barney beating of several years ago is another symptom of our arrested adolescence, our inability to ride the wave of disillusion into the relatively calm harbor of adulthood -- as though flailing around in the storm and raging at the wind were in themselves marks of distinction and a superior sensibility. I remember a news story about a woman in a Barney costume being seriously injured when a rabid (and probably drunken) anti-Barney fanatic attacked the big purple dinosaur at some public event. Now, I don’t know the age of the Barney-beater, but the act itself is a supremely adolescent one, in which the impulsive response to disillusionment is to lash out at those symbols of childhood which made the biggest dupes of us. At the dawn of adolescence, when Barney begins to appear cloying and false, it seems natural to want to beat up on him, as though it was Barney himself who pulled one over on us instead of our own poignant and necessary misapprehension of the nature of things. I could see Holden Caulfield beating up on Barney (at least rhetorically), and I could see Holden Caulfield missing Barney (as he misses all the “phonies” at the end of the book), but I cannot see Holden Caulfield accepting the postlapsarian Barney on new terms, as a figure who is meant for children and not for him. For all his touching poses about wanting to be the “catcher in the rye,” what Holden really wants is not to save children but to be a child again., error: Przeczytałem ostatnio zakończenie Buszującego w zbożu i poczułem, że mam ochotę wziąć Holdena Caulfielda za kołnierzyk, potrząsnąć nim naprawdę mocno i nakrzyczeć na niego, żeby dorósł. Chyba od jakiegoś czasu zrozumiałem, że Buszujący w zbożu — mój ulubiony film, kiedy miałem szesnaście lat — był moim ulubionym właśnie dlatego, że miałem szesnaście lat. W wieku szesnastu lat kryzys Holdena Caulfielda wydawał mi się głęboko poruszający; podziwiałem jego miażdżącą krytykę społeczeństwa, jego przenikliwe zrozumienie natury ludzkiej, jego niezwykłą wrażliwość (no cóż, na litość boską, miał załamanie nerwowe, musiał być wrażliwy). W wieku szesnastu lat chciałem poślubić Holdena Caulfielda. W wieku czterdziestu lat chciałbym go wychłostać. W końcu oskarżenie społeczeństwa przez Holdena sprowadza się do „wglądu”, że każdy jest fałszywy. To jest ten rodzaj wglądu, który szesnastolatek uważa za głęboki. Czterdziestolatek z dorosłego pokolenia uznaje spostrzeżenia Holdena za powierzchowne i banalne, oddając się najtańszemu rodzajowi młodzieńczego pozowania. Sugeruje to zrozumienie społeczeństwa i natury ludzkiej, które jest mniej więcej tak złożone jak odcinek Jeziora marzeń. Holden i jego dorastający rówieśnicy zazwyczaj zachowują się tak, jakby los, który ich spotkał (rozczarowanie i koniec niewinności) był wyjątkowy w historii ludzkości. Nie potrafi patrzeć poza spektakl własnego rozczarowania (i J. D. Salinger również nie potrafi); pomimo całej swojej bolesnej samoświadomości Holden Caulfield nie jest naprawdę samoświadomy. Nie potrafi dostrzec, że sam jest oszustem. Porównajmy na przykład powieść Salingera o zahamowanym rozwoju z prawdziwą powieścią o dorastaniu, Wielkie nadzieje. Holden Caulfield jest nastolatkiem rozmyślającym o dzieciństwie i okresie dojrzewania; Pip Pirrip jest dorosłym rozmyślającym o dzieciństwie i okresie dojrzewania. Holden Caulfield ma tunelowe widzenie okresu dojrzewania i opisuje wydarzenia z bezpośredniością i pochłonięciem doświadczeniem, które blokuje szerszy kontekst, szerszą perspektywę. Pip Pirrip ma cudowną podwójną wizję wrażliwego dorosłego, który wspomina wrażliwe dziecko, którym kiedyś był; przekazuje jednocześnie przekonującą perspektywę dziecka i przemyślaną rewizję wydarzeń przez dorosłego. Podczas gdy Holden Caulfield zaśmieca swoją narrację oburzonymi demaskatorami oszustw i naciągaczy, Pip Pirrip umiejętnie koncentruje się na „fałszywej monecie, którą sam wytworzył” — to znaczy, nie pozwalając dziecku Pipowi i nastoletniemu Pipowi wciągnąć się w żart, demaskuje siebie jako naciągacza. Pip Pirrip dorasta. Holden Caulfield ma załamanie nerwowe. Przypuszczam, że jedynym powodem, dla którego zazdroszczę mu tego załamania, jest to, że tak wielu w naszej kulturze — niestety znacznie więcej niż tylko prawowitych nastolatków wśród nas — wydaje się być zafiksowanych na Holdenie jako symbolu uczciwości i buntu wyzwalającego społeczeństwo. Postrzegamy załamanie nerwowe i dysfunkcję jako oznakę honoru, znak – mówiąc językiem Caulfielda – że jesteśmy wystarczająco spostrzegawczy, by dostrzec cały ten syf. Nasze świętowanie przesadnego niezadowolenia przypomina mi ostatnie zdanie z Arabii Joyce’a: „Patrząc w ciemność, zobaczyłem siebie jako istotę napędzaną i wyśmiewaną przez próżność; a moje oczy płonęły udręką i gniewem”. Oto niezrównana poza nastolatka. Równie samooskarżająca i samouwielbiająca, uchwyca nastolatka w chwili, gdy jego własne rozczarowanie staje się przedmiotem jego wzniosłej i autodramatyzującej wizji. To jest ten rodzaj syfu, którego Holden Caulfield (i J. D. Salinger) nie potrafią dostrzec. I często jest to rodzaj gówna, w którym my, „dorośli”, lubimy się tarzać. Bicie Barneya sprzed kilku lat jest kolejnym objawem naszej zatrzymanej młodości, naszej niezdolności do płynięcia na fali rozczarowania do stosunkowo spokojnego portu dorosłości – jakby machanie rękami w burzy i wściekanie się na wiatr były same w sobie oznakami wyróżnienia i wyższej wrażliwości. Pamiętam doniesienia o kobiecie w kostiumie Barneya, która została poważnie ranna, gdy wściekły (i prawdopodobnie pijany) fanatyk anty-Barneya zaatakował wielkiego fioletowego dinozaura na jakimś publicznym wydarzeniu. Teraz nie wiem, ile lat miał ten, który bił Barneya, ale sam czyn jest niezwykle młodzieńczy, w którym impulsywną reakcją na rozczarowanie jest atak na te symbole dzieciństwa, które nas najbardziej oszukały. Na początku okresu dojrzewania, gdy Barney zaczyna wydawać się mdły i fałszywy, wydaje się naturalne, że chcemy go pobić, jakby to sam Barney nas oszukał, zamiast naszego własnego przejmującego i koniecznego niezrozumienia natury rzeczy. Mogę sobie wyobrazić Holdena Caulfielda bijącego Barneya (przynajmniej retorycznie) i mogę sobie wyobrazić Holdena Caulfielda tęskniącego za Barneyem (podobnie jak tęskni za wszystkimi „fałszywcami” na końcu książki), ale nie mogę sobie wyobrazić Holdena Caulfielda akceptującego postlapsariańskiego Barneya na nowych warunkach, jako postać, która jest przeznaczona dla dzieci, a nie dla niego. Pomimo wszystkich jego wzruszających póz o chęci bycia „buszującym w zbożu”, Holden naprawdę nie chce ratować dzieci, ale znów być dzieckiem. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: ~ 2 stars ~TW/CW:talk of rape and homicide, physical and mental abuse / torture, misogynyThis has to be my most disappointing read of the year so far. Everything I expected, and everything I wanted never happened. I thought that the political aspect was interesting, and while I liked that part, it sadly was not enough to save this book.I’ve been wanting to read this for a while as it’s considered such a staple in dystopian, and in general literature. I’ve even watched a school play which I enjoyed, but of course, that had excluded all the problematic aspects, so I had no idea what I was getting myself into.This book takes on an authoritarianism and totalitarian government, propaganda, censorship, surveillance, etc. and I thought it dealt with that well enough, and making connections between current day and this book was an experience, i'll say that.Having known this going in, it seemed like something I would love, and it checked off many boxes of what I was looking for at the time. I even had many quotes I had highlighted for this review that I thought were insightful, but my very smart self returned the ebook without recording them all. Other than the ones I used for my reading updates of course, but most of those were ones I used to complain.But other than that aspect, it felt like a chore to read. So many things that I didn’t like, and so many things that angered me. I’m reading a story, I want to be immersed, and invested, not bored out of my mind. The writing was nothing special, and the story itself was blander than white bread.The info dumps were absolutely painful too. I don’t know how I pushed through, though barely considering it took me almost 20 days to complete. There was one particular infodump that I especially suffered through, one that would serve to bring up some of these political discussions and simultaneously throw up a bunch of world building on me. It took up more than 13% of the entire book. 13 PERCENT. My brain felt all mushy by the end, and I’m not sure I properly processed any of it. What was the reason? It couldn’t have been any less digestible.And then of course we have the characters. I would gladly fist fight Winston, who is our protagonist. I don’t care if some would consider that elder abuse, I would if I could. I have read from such unlikable characters before, but Winston is on another level of terrible. Again, must I ask, what was the reason? Why was he so absolutely horrible? He constantly sexualizes the women he “loves” in disgusting ways, and her youth, and has some weird grudge against anyone that is “pure”, whatever that means. No, sorry, he just hates women in general. Before knowing Julia, his love interest, he imagined raping her, and then slitting her throat for being, what he thought then, celabite. He contemplated smashing her head against the wall. And those weren’t solidary situations. He spends the entire book saying and thinking creepy, disgusting and irritating stuff. I hate him.And then we have Julia, the only female character that spoke more than one line. And her only role is that she is shallow and weak, existing solely for Winston and his pleasure, and his sexual fantasies. And that is all she cares about. Sex. That is all she lives for, and nothing else. She has no thoughts of her own, and her personality is as annoying as can be. It definitely plays into the whole “women are objects” thing, which of course angered me even more. I mean for goodness sake, the misogyny was so strong with this one. As in the overused trope, which in itself promotes that internalized misogyny. Julia outright says how she hates women. Excuse you?And all the other characters didn’t matter, at least to me, so that neither hurt or helped my experience, but the two we knew the most made me want to chuck the book out the window more times than I could count.And Winston and Julia together was even worse than I could ever imagine. Not only do they not have any chemistry, just a lot of possessiveness, but they are already confessing their love never having properly talked before. Winston spends a good chunk of the book hating on her, but then when she confesses her love, suddenly he is in love with her too. Winston even tells Julia about how he wanted to *coughs* murder her, and she just laughs it off as if it is something normal. If only this behavior was condemned, as it should be.This is the most unromantic relationship ever. And obviously I am aware that perhaps I should not judge the book by it’s characters, and their portrayal, as that is not what the story is truly about. That’s not what is important. But don’t you think that if I’m going to be following their story, that I should at least be able to tolerate them? At the very least. I don’t think I am being unerasable. And perhaps I could have overlooked the characters, had I actually been interested in the story itself, but I did not. Little by little, any hope I had was crushed, and I was bored to no extent, so having to deal with an incel on top of it all did not bode well forFinal Thoughts:Overall, I dragged through this. It was not a good read. This is so highly praised and I just expected better. I can see where people who like it are coming from in some way, but it was a big no for me.

I knew that \"Wrinkle\" was considered to be a classic, but I was unaware that it was considered a Beloved Classic Beyond Criticism. I read this in grade school and just REread it aloud, to my daughter. I didn't have a clear memory of it, though I remember that I loved the way it started. Now I realize why I forgot so much of it. I STILL love the first 3 chapters, and dislike the rest. But since some of you found (and WILL find, I'm sure) my review to be judgmental, harsh and undiplomatic (a review IS a critique, right?) to the point of insulting, I thought I'd do a little research, look over the book again, think about it some more. So I've edited this review. But I find I just can't retract my statements. They are my opinion, that's all, and I haven't changed my mind. I can only try to be open minded, be honest, and try to explain my thoughts & feelings more clearly. Otherwise, I'd be a simpering fake.Like C.S. Lewis books (especially the last of his Chronicles of Narnia, The Last Battle), A Wrinkle In Time has strong, (heavy-handed, I think), overtones of Christian doctrine. I'm not anti-spiritual, but I have a personal discomfort with this kind of religious doctrine. (You many not, and that's fine.) But more than that issue, the book is an odd combination of intelligent hard science, interesting quantum science that is brushed over, and quotes from the bible. At least there are a few respectful mentions of other spiritual leaders from other cultures, and moral messages from classic literature and philosophers. I understand this combination garnered criticism from both religious fundamentalists as well as atheists and secular society. L'Engle has earned my respect for taking on the difficult and controversial marriage of science and religion. She has also earned my criticism for raising this issue and then failing to really grapple with it. It's treated lightly, as though it's a natural thing that should be easy to accept, in spite of the many holes and inconsistencies in her story. I wouldn't even mind, except that this book takes itself SO seriously! It's easy to imagine that a school teacher might use this book to demonstrate that Evolutionist Theory and Creationism can be combined, but I find science and religion to have a disjointed and uneasy coexistence in this book. One is always dropped abruptly for the other. Or at least, it seems so to me.Ok. Now that I have tackled that big one, let's move on. I found the characters rather flat, (the genius child, the misfit girl, the beautiful, genius, scientist mother who nonetheless stays home and cooks stew in bunsen burners while her husband has adventures). The story itself is made up of vague scenarios of conflict of the psyche and spirit, with the entire Universe at stake. L'Engle's metaphors are obvious and their manifestations flat. [SPOILER ALERT] There is a quest to fight a \"Darkness\" (oooh!) that wants to rid us all of individuality & free will. There are 3 beings who used to be stars before they died in the fight with the \"Darkness\" and became something beyond our comprehension. They can appear in any form to us, so that we have some way of processing their existence. They are, in fact, so beyond anything knowable that I can't feel much for them or say much about them, except that they make a convenient plot device for transporting the characters throughout the Universe and the story. Anyway, the \"Darkness\" takes over a planet which turns into a kind of sci-fi beehive, with brainwashed automatons. I found the planet to be delightfully creepy and would have liked to know more about it, (even if it seems suspiciously like a thinly veiled anti-communist warning message.) So guess what's doing the brainwashing? - a giant, evil, disembodied brain, called IT, who is personally responsible for spreading the Darkness across the Universe. Really? A brain? Doesn't anyone else find this simplistic and cliche? The main character defeats this brain by gushing love. I am quite sure that many, many readers were moved to tears by Meg's gushing, but I do not happen to be that kind of person. Before Meg realizes that she has the power to gush love, the crusaders tesser through time and space (no explanation of how the father can do this) to a fascinating planet with very interesting aliens who can't see, but have other senses. I'd have loved to know more about their society and these mysterious other senses, but again, these ideas aren't very developed.These are the things in this book, and in L'Engle's writing that I love: As I mentioned, I love her courage in at least attempting a controversial issue like mixing science and spirituality. I love that this book has the heart to recognize love as the greatest power, and that it has the wisdom to recognize fear as one of the biggest weapons. I love that individuality prevails, and the romantic in me approves of the loving, whole family. I love that she has enough respect for children that she included difficult vocabulary and a few difficult concepts. Many children are far more capable of handling complex ideas than we give them credit for, especially if we expose them to these things early on. I love that L'Engle doesn't underestimate them in this way, at least initially, on the surface. Since my biggest problems with this book all involve my finding it simplistic, naive, and certain parts of it cliche & obvious, I wonder if I need to remind myself that it's meant for children. Perhaps children should be idealistic, or even naive, in the way that this book is. But then I wonder if that is another way of underestimating them. ESPECIALLY since I felt exactly the same way when I read this book as a child!Wind In The Willows makes me feel closer to God, or a creative power (though there's some gushing in there too, at the end.) The Jungle Book explores social constructs and morals, more deeply and naturally, for me. A Sound Of Thunder blew my mind, in grade school, with its \"butterfly effect\" theory of the power and responsibility of each individual. All of these are childrens' books, though they span generations, and time and space, more gracefully than tessering did for me. I could name so many more.But, if A Wrinkle In Time opened your mind to new ideas, (instead of making you feel frustrated by light treatment of them), made you question some latent prejudice, (instead of feeling bored by obvious metaphors), lifted your spirits & made you cheer for bookish outcasts, (instead of feeling that no one is that one-dimensional) or cry for the love of a big sister & little brother, (instead of cringing when a version of \"I love you Charles Wallace\" appears 19 times in 2 pages), then it is a wonderful book.

Before Meg realizes that she has the power to gush love, the crusaders tesser through time and space (no explanation of how the father can do this) to a fascinating planet with very interesting aliens who can't see, but have other senses. I'd have loved to know more about their society and these mysterious other senses, but again, these ideas aren't very developed.These are the things in this book, and in L'Engle's writing that I love: As I mentioned, I love her courage in at least attempting a controversial issue like mixing science and spirituality. I love that this book has the heart to recognize love as the greatest power, and that it has the wisdom to recognize fear as one of the biggest weapons. I love that individuality prevails, and the romantic in me approves of the loving, whole family. I love that she has enough respect for children that she included difficult vocabulary and a few difficult concepts. Many children are far more capable of handling complex ideas than we give them credit for, especially if we expose them to these things early on. I love that L'Engle doesn't underestimate them in this way, at least initially, on the surface. Since my biggest problems with this book all involve my finding it simplistic, naive, and certain parts of it cliche & obvious, I wonder if I need to remind myself that it's meant for children. Perhaps children should be idealistic, or even naive, in the way that this book is. But then I wonder if that is another way of underestimating them. ESPECIALLY since I felt exactly the same way when I read this book as a child!Wind In The Willows makes me feel closer to God, or a creative power (though there's some gushing in there too, at the end.) The Jungle Book explores social constructs and morals, more deeply and naturally, for me. A Sound Of Thunder blew my mind, in grade school, with its \"butterfly effect\" theory of the power and responsibility of each individual. All of these are childrens' books, though they span generations, and time and space, more gracefully than tessering did for me. I could name so many more.But, if A Wrinkle In Time opened your mind to new ideas, (instead of making you feel frustrated by light treatment of them), made you question some latent prejudice, (instead of feeling bored by obvious metaphors), lifted your spirits & made you cheer for bookish outcasts, (instead of feeling that no one is that one-dimensional) or cry for the love of a big sister & little brother, (instead of cringing when a version of \"I love you Charles Wallace\" appears 19 times in 2 pages), then it is a wonderful book.

            "Translation failed for: This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly. Just like the spate of Native American pop fiction in the late eighties, this is overwhelmingly colonized literature, in that it pretends to reveal some aspect of the 'other' culture, but on closer inspection (aside from the occasional tidbit) it is a thoroughly western story, firmly ensconced in the western tradition.Even those tidbits Hosseini gives are of such a vague degree that to be impressed by them, one would have to have almost no knowledge of the history of Afghanistan, nor the cultural conflicts raging there between the Shia and Sunni Muslims, or how it formed asurrogate battlegroundfor Russia and the United States in the Cold War, or forColonial conflictsin the centuries before. Sadly, for all the daily news reports about Afghanistan, most people know very little of its history.Hosseini's story is thickly foreshadowed and wraps up so neatly in the end that the reader will never have to worry about being surprised. Every convenient coincidence that could happen, does happen. He does attempt to bring some excitement to the story with dramatized violence, but that's hardly a replacement for a well-constructed plot. He is also fond of forcing tension by creating a small conflict between two characters and then having them agonize over it for years, despite the fact that it would be easy to fix and the characters have no reason to maintain the conflict. And since the conflict does not grow or change over time, everything is quickly reduced to petty and repetitive reactions.He even creates a cliched 'white devil' character, a literal sociopath (and pedophile) as the symbol for the 'evils' of the Taliban. This creates an odd conflict in the narrative, since one of the main themes is that simple inequalities and pointless conflicts stem from Afghan tradition, itself. His indelicate inclusion of wealthy, beautiful, white power as the source of religious turmoil in the mid-east negates his assertion that the conflicts are caused by small-mindedness.The fact that this character seems to have the depth of motivation of a Disney villain also means that he does not work as a representation of the fundamental causes of colonial inequality, which tend to be economic, not personal. The various mixed messages about the contributors to the ongoing Afghan conflict suggest that Hosseini does not have anything insightful to say about it.Perhaps the worst part about this book is how much it caters to the ignorance of White America. It will allow naive readers to feel better about themselves for feeling sympathy with the larger mid-east conflict, but is also lets them retain a sense of superiority over the Muslims for their 'backwards, classicist, warlike' ways. In short, it supports the condescending, parental view that many Americans already have about the rest of the world. And it does all this without revealing any understanding of the vast and vital economic concerns which make the greater mid-east so vitally important to the future of the world.It is unfortunate that nowhere amongst this book's artfully dramatized violence and alternative praising and demonizing of the West is there the underlying sense of why this conflict is happening, of what put it all into place, and of why it will continue to drag us all down. The point where it could turn sympathy into indignation or realization is simply absent.There is a bad joke on the internet showing a map of the world with the mid-east replaced by a sea-filled crater with the comment 'problem solved'. What this map fails to represent is that there is a reason the Westkeeps meddlingin the affairs of the mid-east, and that every time we do, it creates another conflict--because almost every group who we decry as terrorists now were originally trained and armed by the US and Western powers to serve our economic interests.As long as we see extremists as faceless sociopaths, we can do nothing against them. We must recognize thatnormal people fall down these paths, and that everyone sees himself as being 'in the right'. Who is more right: the Westerner whose careless bomb kills a child, or the Muslim's that does?The point shouldn't be to separate the 'good Muslims' from the 'bad Muslims', because people aren't fundamentally good or bad. They are fundamentally people. Almost without exception, they are looking out for their future, their children, and their communities. Calling someone 'evil' merely means you have ceased to try understanding their point of view, and decided instead to merely hate because it's easier to remain ignorant than to try to understand.This book isn't particularly insightful or well-written, but that is in no way unusual in bestsellers. The problem is that Americans are going to use this book to justify their ignorance about the problems in the east. This book will make people feel better about themselves, instead of helping them to think better about the world.For an actually insightful, touching view of the Afghan conflict, I would suggest avoiding this bit of naive melodrama and looking up Emmanuel Guibert's'The Photographer'., error: This is the sort of book White America reads to feel worldly.

            "Translation failed for: If there are no wrong answers, can we really say that something has any meaning?It is very easy to start an interesting science fiction story. Simply begin with a mystery. Don't explain things to the reader and leave them in a state of wonder. In this way, everything will seem interesting, intriguing, and worth exploring. Tap into the reader’s powers of imagination and allow them to make your story interesting in ways you need not imagine, and perhaps cannot create. This is a good plan for starting a science fiction story. Lots of science fiction stories begin in this way. On television, almost all of them do – ‘X-Files’, ‘Lost’, ‘Battlestar Galactica’, ‘The 4400’, ‘The truth is out there.’ ‘They have a plan.’‘The Giver’ starts in this way. In the first few pages as the setting unfolded, I was struck by the parallels to China after the cultural revolution – the bicycles, the uniform-like clothing, the regulated life, the shame based culture, and ‘the sameness’. I also thought of China, because I immediately grasped that this had to be a culture which was designed to gently crash its population. There were many clues that the world was heavily overpopulated and the primary goal of the culture so described was to crash the population without descending into society destroying anarchy - the highly regulated birthrate, which was insufficient to sustain the population. To sustain the population, more than 17 out of each 25 females would have to be assigned to be birth mothers, and this clearly wasn’t the case. The replacement rate for a society is about 2.3 live births per female (maybe 2.1 in a society that is safe and careful) – clearly they were implied to be below this ratio so clearly this was a society that was trying to shed population.Equally clearly, this was a society that engaged in widespread euthanasia for the most trivial of causes, which hints at a culture which doesn’t value life because people are in such abundance that they can be readily disposed of. I suspected that ‘Release’ was euthanasia almost immediately from the context in which it was introduced, and this was almost immediately confirmed when it was revealed that infants were subject to ‘release’. Clearly, infants can't be meaningfully banished, so clearly release was euthanasia. So I was intrigued by the story. I wanted to see what happened to Jonas and his naive family who had so poised themselves on the edge of a great family wrecking tragedy in just the first few dozen pages of the story. I wanted to receive from the storyteller answers to the questions that the story was poising, if not some great profound message then at least some story that followed from what she began.But it was not to be. The first clue that the whole construct was to eventually come crashing down was that Jonas clearly didn’t understand ‘release’ to mean ‘euthanasia’. Nor in fact did anyone seem to know what ‘release’ meant. This shocked me, because in the context of the setting it was virtually impossible that he and everyone else did not know. I could very easily imagine a stable society where human life was not prized – after all, societies that believe that human life is intrinsically valuable are historically far less common than ones that don’t. We know that the society is life affirming, both because we are told how pained and shocked they are by loss and by the fact that Jonas responds to scenes of death with pity and anger. What I could not believe in was a society which held the concept of ‘precision of language’ so tightly and so centrally that the protagonist could not imagine lying could in fact be founded on lies. That’s impossible. No society like that can long endure. Some technological explanation would be required to explain how the society managed to hide the truth from itself. If release took place in some conscious state of mind, then surely the dispensers of Justice, the Nurturers, the Caregivers, and the sanitation workers would all know the lie, and all suspect – as Jonas did – that they were being lied to as well. Surely all of these would suspect what their own future release would actually entail, and surely at least some of them would reject it. Surely some not inconsequential number of new children, reared to value precision of language and to affirm the value of life, would rebel at the audacity of the lie if nothing else. Even in a society that knew nothing of love, even if only the society had as much feeling as the members of the family displayed, and even if people only valued others as much as the Community was shown to value others, surely some level of attachment would exist between people. Soma or not, the seeds of pain, tragedy, conflict and rebellion are present if ever the truth is known to anyone.Nothing about the story makes any sense. None of it bears any amount of scrutiny at all. The more seriously you consider it, the more stupid and illogical the whole thing becomes. We are given to believe that the society has no conception of warfare, to the point that it cannot recognize a child’s war game for what it is, and yet we are also given to believe that they train pilots in flying what is implied to be a fighter craft and that the community maintains anti-aircraft weapons on a state of high alert such that they could shoot down such a fighter craft on a moments notice. We are given to believe that all wild animals are unknown to the community, yet we are also given to believe that potential pest species like squirrels and birds are not in fact extinct. How do you possibly keep them out of the community if they exist in any numbers elsewhere? We are given to believe that technology exists sufficient to fill in the oceans and control the weather and replace the natural biosphere with something capable of sustaining humanity, but that technological innovation continues in primitive culture. We are given to believe that they are worried about overpopulation and starvation, and yet also that most of the world is empty and uninhabited or that this inherently xenophobic community lives in isolation if in fact it doesn’t span the whole of the Earth. We are given to believe that this is a fully industrial society, yet the community at most has a few thousands of people. Surely thousands of such communities must exist to maintain an aerospace industry, to say nothing of weather controllers. Why is no thought given to the hundreds of other Receivers of Memory which must exist in their own small circles of communities in the larger Community? Surely any plan which ignores the small communities place in the larger is foredoomed to failure? Surely the Receiver of Memory knows what a purge or a pogrom is?How are we to believe that Jonas’s father, whose compassion for little Gabriel is so great that he risks breaking the rules for his sake, whose compassion for little Gabriel is so great that he risks face by going to the committee to plead for Gabriel’s life, whose compassion for little Gabriel is so great that he discomforts himself and his whole family for a year for the sake of the child, is the same man who so easily abandons that same child at a single setback when he has witnessed the child grow and prosper? Doesn’t it seem far easier to believe that this same man, who is openly scornful of the skills and nurturing ability of the night crew, would more readily blame the night crew for Gabriel’s discomfort? I can only conclude, just as I can only conclude about the illogical fact that no one knows what release is, that everything is plastic within the dictates of the plot. Jonas’s father feels and acts one way when the needs of the plot require it and feels and acts in different ways when the needs of the plot require something else. What I can’t believe is that this is any sort of whole and internally consistent character or setting. Every single thing when held up to the light falls apart. There is not one page which is even as substantial as tissue paper.It is almost impossible to draw meaning from nonsense, so it is no wonder that people have wondered at the ending. What happens? The great virtue of the story as far as modern educators are probably concerned is that there are no wrong answers. What ever you wish to imagine is true is every bit as good of answer as any other. Perhaps he lives. Perhaps he finds a community which lives in the old ways, knowing choice – and war and conflict (which probably explains why the community needs anti-aircraft defenses). But more likely from the context he dies. Perhaps he is delusional. Perhaps he gets to the bottom and lies down in the deepening snow which the runners can no longer be pushed through and he dies. Perhaps he dies and goes to heaven, maybe even the heaven of the one whose birthday is celebrated by the implied Holiday. Perhaps it is even the case that he was sent to his death by the cynical Giver, who knew his death was necessary to release the memories he contained by to the community. Perhaps he didn’t just die, but was slaughtered as the sacrificial lamb – killed by a murderous lie from the one he trusted too well. For my entry in the meaningless answers contest, I propose that the whole thing was just a dream. This seems the easiest way to explain the contradictions. A dream doesn’t have to make sense. And the biggest clue that it is a dream is of course that Jonas sees the world in black and white, with only the occasional flashes of recognized color around important colorful things as is typical of that sort of black and white dream. Perhaps Jonas will wake up and engage in dream sharing with his family, and they will laugh at the silliness and then go to the ceremony of twelves. Or perhaps the whole community is only a dream, and Jonas will wake up and go downstairs and open his Christmas presents with his family., error: If there are no wrong answers, can we really say that something has any meaning?It is very easy to start an interesting science fiction story.

            "Translation failed for: I found a lot of this book incredibly tedious. I tend to avoid the winners of the Man / Booker – they make me a little depressed. The only Carey I haven’t liked won the Booker (Oscar and Lucinda), I really didn’t like the little bit ofVernon God LittleI read and I never finishedThe Seadespite really liking Banville’s writing. So, being told a book is a winner of the Booker tends to be a mark against it from the start, unfortunately.I’m going to have to assume you have read this book, as if I don’t I won’t be able to say anything about it at all. Apparently, when Yann Martel wrote this he was feeling a bit down and this was his way of plucking himself up. Well, good on him. That’s just great. I was a little annoyed when I found out that the person the book is dedicated to had also written a story about a man in a boat with a wild cat and had considered suing for plagiarism.The book is written by a member of that class of people who are my least favourite; a religious person who cannot conceive of someone not being religious. There is some fluff at the start in which atheism is ‘discussed’ (read, discarded) as something people inevitably give up on with their dying breath. But the religious are generally terribly arrogant, so it is best not to feel insulted by their endless insults – they know not what they do.Parts of this were so badly over written that it was almost enough to make me stop reading. The bit where he is opening his first can of water is a case in point. This takes so long and is so incidental to the story and written in such a cutesy way that I started to pray the boat would sink, the tiger would get him … I would even have accepted God smiting him at this point as a valid plotting point, even if (or particularly because) it would bring the story to an abrupt end.This is a book told as two possible stories of how a young man survives for 227 days floating across the Pacific Ocean told in 100 chapters. That was the other thing that I found annoying – much is made of the fact this story is told in 100 chapters – but I could not feel any necessity for many of the chapters. Just as I could not feel any necessity for the Italic voice that sounded like Tom Waits doing, “What is he building in there?” Well, except to introduce us again to Pi some number of years later. You know, inInvisible CitiesCalvino has necessary chapters – this book just has 100 chapters. It was something that annoyed me from early on in the book – that the chapters seemed far too arbitrary and pointing it out at the end just made me more irritated. There may well be some Hindu reason for 100 chapters – but like Jesus ticking off the ancient prophecies on his way to martyrdom, I still couldn’t see why these chapters were needed in themselves.Pi is the central character in the book who, for some odd reason, is named after a swimming pool – I started playing with the ideas of swimming pools and oceans in my head to see where that might lead, but got bored. He is an active, practicing member of three of the world’s major religions. There is a joke in the early part of the book about him possibly becoming Jewish (ha ha – or perhaps I should draw a smiley face?). The only religion missing entirely from the book is Buddhism. Well, when I say entirely, it is interesting that it is a Japanese ship that sinks and that the people Pi tells his story to are Japanese engineers. I’ve known Hindus who consider Buddhists to be little more than dirty, filthy atheists – so perhaps that is one reason why these Japanese engineers are treated with such contempt at the end of the book.The Japanese make the connections between the two stories – but we can assume that they stuff up these connections. While it is clear the French Cook is the hyena, Pi’s mum is the orang-utang, and the Asian gentleman is the zebra, I’m not convinced Pi is meant to be the tiger. In fact, the one constant (that’s a pun, by the way, you are supposed to be laughing) in both stories in Pi.My interpretation is that the tiger is actually God. Angry, jealous, vicious, hard to appease, arbitrary and something that takes up lots of time when you have better things to do – sounds like God to me.The last little bit of the book has Pi asking which is the better story- the one with animals or the one he tells with people. I mean, this is an unfair competition – he has spent chapter after chapter telling the animal story and only the last couple telling the people story. The point of this, though, is Pascal’s wager said anew. If we can never really know if there is no god and it ultimately makes no difference if we tell the story with him or without him in it, but if the story is more beautiful with him in it – then why not just accept him in the story and be damned.Well, because the story isn’t improved with the animals and life isn’t just a story and kid’s stories are great sometimes, but I often like adult stories at least as much – and sometimes even more.This is yet another person all alone survival story, but one I don’t feel that was handled as well as it could have been – mostly because the writer had an ideological message that he felt was more important than the story – never a good sign. Worse still, in the end I really couldn’t care less about Pi – I knew he was going to survive and knew it would be ‘because of’ his faith.He does talk about Jesus’ most petulant moment with the fig tree – so I was quite impressed that rated a mention – but, all the same, I haven’t been converted to any or all of the world religions discussed in this book.Compare this tale with the bit out ofA History of the World in Ten and a Half Chaptersabout the painting – I know, it is not a fair comparison, Barnes is a god, but I’ve made it anyway.I didn’t really enjoy this book, I felt it tried too hard and didn’t quite make it. But Christians will love it – oh yeah – Christians will definitely love it., error: I found a lot of this book incredibly tedious. I tend to avoid the winners of the Man / Booker – they make me a little depressed. The only Carey I haven’t liked won the Booker (Oscar and Lucinda), I really didn’t like the little bit ofVernon God LittleI read and I never finishedThe Seadespite really liking Banville’s writing. So, being told a book is a winner of the Booker tends to be a mark against it from the start, unfortunately.I’m going to have to assume you have read this book, as if I don’t I won’t be able to say anything about it at all. Apparently, when Yann Martel wrote this he was feeling a bit down and this was his way of plucking himself up. Well, good on him. That’s just great. I was a little annoyed when I found out that the person the book is dedicated to had also written a story about a man in a boat with a wild cat and had considered suing for plagiarism.The book is written by a member of that class of people who are my least favourite; a religious person who cannot conceive of someone not being religious. There is some fluff at the start in which atheism is ‘discussed’ (read, discarded) as something people inevitably give up on with their dying breath. But the religious are generally terribly arrogant, so it is best not to feel insulted by their endless insults – they know not what they do.Parts of this were so badly over written that it was almost enough to make me stop reading. The bit where he is opening his first can of water is a case in point. This takes so long and is so incidental to the story and written in such a cutesy way that I started to pray the boat would sink, the tiger would get him … I would even have accepted God smiting him at this point as a valid plotting point, even if (or particularly because) it would bring the story to an abrupt end.This is a book told as two possible stories of how a young man survives for 227 days floating across the Pacific Ocean told in 100 chapters. That was the other thing that I found annoying – much is made of the fact this story is told in 100 chapters – but I could not feel any necessity for many of the chapters. Just as I could not feel any necessity for the Italic voice that sounded like Tom Waits doing, “What is he building in there?” Well, except to introduce us again to Pi some number of years later. You know, inInvisible CitiesCalvino has necessary chapters – this book just has 100 chapters. It was something that annoyed me from early on in the book – that the chapters seemed far too arbitrary and pointing it out at the end just made me more irritated. There may well be some Hindu reason for 100 chapters – but like Jesus ticking off the ancient prophecies on his way to martyrdom, I still couldn’t see why these chapters were needed in themselves.Pi is the central character in the book who, for some odd reason, is named after a swimming pool – I started playing with the ideas of swimming pools and oceans in my head to see where that might lead, but got bored. He is an active, practicing member of three of the world’s major religions. There is a joke in the early part of the book about him possibly becoming Jewish (ha ha – or perhaps I should draw a smiley face?). The only religion missing entirely from the book is Buddhism. Well, when I say entirely, it is interesting that it is a Japanese ship that sinks and that the people Pi tells his story to are Japanese engineers. I’ve known Hindus who consider Buddhists to be little more than dirty, filthy atheists – so perhaps that is one reason why these Japanese engineers are treated with such contempt at the end of the book.The Japanese make the connections between the two stories – but we can assume that they stuff up these connections. While it is clear the French Cook is the hyena, Pi’s mum is the orang-utang, and the Asian gentleman is the zebra, I’m not convinced Pi is meant to be the tiger. In fact, the one constant (that’s a pun, by the way, you are supposed to be laughing) in both stories in Pi.My interpretation is that the tiger is actually God. Angry, jealous, vicious, hard to appease, arbitrary and something that takes up lots of time when you have better things to do – sounds like God to me.The last little bit of the book has Pi asking which is the better story- the one with animals or the one he tells with people. I mean, this is an unfair competition – he has spent chapter after chapter telling the animal story and only the last couple telling the people story. The point of this, though, is Pascal’s wager said anew. If we can never really know if there is no god and it ultimately makes no difference if we tell the story with him or without him in it, but if the story is more beautiful with him in it – then why not just accept him in the story and be damned.Well, because the story isn’t improved with the animals and life isn’t just a story and kid’s stories are great sometimes, but I often like adult stories at least as much – and sometimes even more.This is yet another person all alone survival story, but one I don’t feel that was handled as well as it could have been – mostly because the writer had an ideological message that he felt was more important than the story – never a good sign.

Sure, it’s awesome to watch sea-faring maniacs risk life and limb to haul in the nasty creatures that pay their bills, but there’s nothing else to it, just dudes getting stoked over a huge haul of crabs, or lamenting some element of the life they’ve chosen.

I don’t even know what the hell that statement on the cover is supposed to mean, but ‘postwar America’ were powerful buzzwords at the time, and truly, what else could you possibly use as a thematic defense for this book, seeing as the book has nothing to offer except the ridiculous tale of a weathered old pervert ogling young girls on the hopscotch courts, finding one that epitomizes his unacceptable desires, and eventually having his way with her before attempting to completely control her young body and mind during a trek that can only be considered kidnapping on the grandest scale. Let’s not forget that when his precious nymphette is purloined by an unknown fiend, he goes off to ambush the guy and shoot his ass; this is not the behavior of the ‘hypercivilized’; my own rather sloppy upbringing declares that anyone with a shred of civility offers his adversary a duel rather than attack him unawares, Humbert is a lowly coward of the worst disposition.

            "Translation failed for: He slapped her hard. Salander opened her eyes wide, but before she could react, he grabbed her by the shoulder and threw her on to the bed. The violence caught her by surprise. When she tried to turn over, he pressed her down on the bed and straddled her.That's just to give you a little taste of what one is dealing with by picking up this book. If you can handle that and the previousxamount of paragraphs and the followingxamount of paragraphs, you're golden. If that sort of makes that thing in your throat rise up a little bit and make your mouth taste sour, you might reconsider reading this book.Carry on.I wasn't going to read this book, ever. But then I saw the theater up the street from me (a cool one that plays those indie and art films, and their popcorn is always sort of either stale or slightly burnt, and the employees all have an air of snootiness - it's one of my favorite places in town) is showing the foreign movie. My first thought was, \"When did they make a movie of this book?\" My second thought was, \"Dammit. I sort of want to see that movie.\" My third thought was, \"Sonsofbitches. I can't see it until I read it.\" (Yes, I'm hard on myself, thanks.) So last weekend when we went out of town I decided it was the best time to purchase it and read it. The mini-break was going to entail my boyfriend spending hours playing guitars with his brother and then later with his BFF, and his brother's fiance and his BFF's wife were all conveniently elsewhere for the most part, so I had the fantastic opportunity to tag along andnot have to do a damn thing. I sat on the couch/futon/floor and read. I read a freaking lot. This was the book I had along to read.It passed the time. It didn't bore me. It held my attention.And... that's about it.It didn't turn my world upside down, or even teeter it necessarily. This is what I like to refer to as a nice popcorn read. I didn't have to give it a lot of thought, the story sort of did the work for me, I was just an innocent and willing bystander. I actually got a little annoyed the few times when it felt like I was beginning to have to work. Like figuring out who the hell Larsson was talking about at any given moment - he was apparently one of those authors who liked to use a character's first name in one sentence and then refer to the same character by their last name in the next sentence. What's up with that? Make a freaking decision and stick with it. Eventually I stopped caring so much.My biggest annoyance with the book (and likely to be the most offense to lovers of this book who stumble across my humble review here) was not the violence and the rape; it actually was Lisbeth Salander. The female protagonist. Okay, so she's cool. Igetthat. She's Hotty-McHotterson, all corporate and world-weary and a computer hacker to boot. She's pierced and inked, and for some reason this is such a source of fascination for Larsson (and apparently everyone who reads this book). Every time Salander comes into the story there is a mention about her piercings, her surly attitude, her tough clothes, her tattoos. At one point another character counts her tattoos. Six.Six. This apparently contributes to some point Larsson was trying to make that Salander is a social freak, but he's still clearly obsessed with the image of her. For the record, numerous piercings, surly attitudes, tough clothes and six tattoos sums up just about every female I know. It's not all that bizarre. This is, after all, the 21st century. Anyone who lived through the 80s/90s either embodies all of those things or at least doesn't bat an eyelash at those things in others. Maybe it's different in Sweden. Maybe they're just now getting the whole dyed-hair-pierced-faces-crazy-tattoos craze there. Wow. Way to go, Sweden. Maybe if you all hadn't spent the last 30 years listening to ABBA and Europeobsessively, you might actually not find kick-ass girls in boots all that magical.All of these unfair generalizations aside, I can honestly say that I read this book and I'm not all that excited about it. I'm not dying to read the next one, but I'm sure I will eventually (probably if they make a movie of it too). I'm certainly not waiting with bated breath for the third book in the trilogy to come out. I guess I'm just not that fascinated by Salander in particular, so I don't really care what happens to her next. Maybe the movie will make me feel differently. We'll see.ETA (01/14/12): I have since readThe Girl Who Played with Firewhich I enjoyed more than this first book, though my impression of Lisbeth hadn't changed that much. I have also seen the Hollywood version ofThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoowhich I liked more than the book because the performances were fantastic, Fincher is a wonderful director, and I felt like the characters could breathe which is something I felt they were unable to do in the book because they were so constricted and pigeon-holed., error: Uderzył ją mocno. Salander szeroko otworzyła oczy, ale zanim zdążyła zareagować, złapał ją za ramię i rzucił na łóżko. Przemoc ją zaskoczyła. Kiedy próbowała się obrócić, przycisnął ją do łóżka i usiadł na niej okrakiem. To tylko po to, żeby dać ci mały przedsmak tego, z czym masz do czynienia, biorąc tę ​​książkę do ręki. Jeśli możesz to znieść, poprzednią ilość akapitów i następną ilość akapitów, jesteś zwycięzcą. Jeśli to sprawia, że ​​to coś w twoim gardle trochę się podnosi i sprawia, że ​​twoje usta smakują kwaśno, możesz rozważyć ponowne przeczytanie tej książki. Kontynuuj. Nie zamierzałem czytać tej książki, nigdy. Ale potem zobaczyłem, że kino na końcu ulicy ode mnie (fajne, w którym grają te filmy niezależne i artystyczne, a ich popcorn jest zawsze albo zwietrzały, albo lekko spalony, a wszyscy pracownicy mają aurę zarozumiałości - to jedno z moich ulubionych miejsc w mieście) wyświetla zagraniczny film. Moją pierwszą myślą było: „Kiedy nakręcili film na podstawie tej książki?” Moją drugą myślą było: „Do cholery. Chcę zobaczyć ten film”. Moją trzecią myślą było: „Skurwysyny. Nie mogę go obejrzeć, dopóki go nie przeczytam”. (Tak, jestem dla siebie surowy, dzięki.) Więc w zeszły weekend, kiedy wyjechaliśmy z miasta, zdecydowałem, że to najlepszy moment, żeby go kupić i przeczytać. Mini-wypad miał oznaczać, że mój chłopak spędzi godziny na graniu na gitarach ze swoim bratem, a później ze swoim najlepszym przyjacielem, a narzeczona jego brata i żona jego najlepszego przyjaciela byli wygodnie gdzie indziej przez większość czasu, więc miałem fantastyczną okazję, żeby się przyłączyć i nie musieć nic robić. Usiadłem na kanapie/futonie/podłodze i czytałem. Czytałem cholernie dużo. To była książka, którą miałem ze sobą do przeczytania. Zabijała czas. Nie nudziła mnie. Przykuwała moją uwagę. I... to tyle. Nie wywróciła mojego świata do góry nogami, ani nawet nie zachwiała nim koniecznie. To jest to, co lubię nazywać przyjemną lekturą na popcorn. Nie musiałem się nad tym zbytnio zastanawiać, historia w pewnym sensie zrobiła za mnie robotę, byłem po prostu niewinnym i chętnym widzem. Właściwie trochę mnie to zirytowało, gdy kilka razy czułem, że zaczynam musieć pracować. Jakbym próbował zrozumieć, o kim do cholery mówi Larsson w danym momencie - najwyraźniej był jednym z tych autorów, którzy lubią używać imienia postaci w jednym zdaniu, a następnie odnosić się do tej samej postaci po nazwisku w następnym zdaniu. O co chodzi? Podejmij cholerną decyzję i trzymaj się jej. W końcu przestałem się tak bardzo przejmować. Moją największą irytacją w tej książce (i prawdopodobnie największą obrazą dla miłośników tej książki, którzy natknęli się na moją skromną recenzję tutaj) nie była przemoc i gwałt; to była Lisbeth Salander. Główna bohaterka. Okej, więc jest spoko. Rozumiem. Jest Hotty-McHotterson, cała korporacyjna i zmęczona światem, a do tego hakerka komputerowa. Ma piercing i tatuaż, i z jakiegoś powodu jest to tak fascynujące dla Larssona (i najwyraźniej każdego, kto czyta tę książkę). Za każdym razem, gdy Salander pojawia się w opowieści, jest wzmianka o jej piercingu, jej ponurym nastawieniu, jej twardych ubraniach, jej tatuażach. W pewnym momencie inna postać liczy jej tatuaże. Sześć. Sześć. To najwyraźniej przyczynia się do pewnego momentu, w którym Larsson próbował przedstawić Salander jako towarzyską dziwaczkę, ale nadal jest wyraźnie zafascynowany jej wizerunkiem. Dla porządku, liczne piercingi, ponury nastawienie, twarde ubrania i sześć tatuaży podsumowują niemal każdą kobietę, którą znam. To wcale nie jest takie dziwne. W końcu to XXI wiek. Każdy, kto przeżył lata 80. i 90., albo uosabia wszystkie te rzeczy, albo przynajmniej nie mrugnie okiem na te rzeczy u innych. Może w Szwecji jest inaczej. Może dopiero teraz ogarnia ich moda na farbowane włosy, przekłute twarze, szalone tatuaże. Wow. Dobra robota, Szwecja. Może gdybyście nie spędzili ostatnich 30 lat na słuchaniu ABBY i Europe obsesyjnie, nie uważalibyście tych niesamowitych dziewczyn w butach za coś magicznego. Pomijając wszystkie te niesprawiedliwe uogólnienia, mogę szczerze powiedzieć, że przeczytałem tę książkę i nie jestem nią specjalnie podekscytowany. Nie umieram z ochoty, żeby przeczytać kolejną, ale jestem pewien, że w końcu to zrobię (prawdopodobnie jeśli nakręcą też film). Na pewno nie czekam z zapartym tchem na wydanie trzeciej części trylogii. Chyba po prostu nie jestem aż tak zafascynowany Salander, więc nie obchodzi mnie, co się z nią stanie. Może film sprawi, że poczuję się inaczej. Zobaczymy.ETA (14.01.12): Od tamtej pory przeczytałam Dziewczynę, która bawiła się ogniem, która podobała mi się bardziej niż pierwsza książka, chociaż moje wrażenie o Lisbeth nie zmieniło się aż tak bardzo.

            "Translation failed for: This is actually a very difficult book for me to rate. Certain aspects of it were very good. Others, I didn't care for at all. I suppose I can say that as a whole I liked it \"okay\". Somewhere between a 2 and a 3, but I'm going to round down due to the seriousness of my dislikes.What worked for me:- Attention to detail (more on that below, however). It was very easy for me to visualize scenes and actions.- In general, the premise for the novel was interesting. And some parts of it were very exciting to read with lots of good drama.- Claire was in some ways a decently strong protagonist. I liked her smart mouth and I liked the way she pushed back against her male counterparts. For the most part, I liked her.- I like Jamie quite a bit (more than that below, however). I found him to be a very likable character and well fleshed out. He was a nice blend of good traits and bad, and he had a lot of depth to him. I'll say that I didn't find him quite as swoony as some do, but I did like him a lot. I loved the way he loved Claire. I bought it - the chemistry and his care for her. And there were more than a few scenes where their relationship was very touching.- I liked the tie-ins with history. The author seemed to have put quite a bit of research into this. It felt fairly authentic, at least as far as books such as this go.- Some of the secondaries were really well done.- As a whole, the writing was better than average.What didn't work for me:- First, this book needed a serious round of editing. I like long books and as I mentioned above, I liked the author's attention to detail. But this was long out of mostly author self indulgence. There were several scenes that just went on and on and on, going into far more detail than necessary, to the point of major plot distraction. And then other scenes really added nothing at all. Despite what the length of this novel would suggest, the plot was pretty simple. It was just repetitive and long-winded. I'd say a solid 1/3 of it could have been whacked and the story wouldn't have suffered at all.- Secondly, the abundence of sexual violence - rape, assault, etc - was a big turn off for me. Or really, not the existance of it in the book, but how the author chose to utilize it over and over as plot devices. I do get that rape and such was common historically. I'm not objecting to the author using it once or even twice. That's realistic.But EVERY plot point in this book was driven by it. Over and over, either against Claire (she was *almost* raped something like 5-6+ times... and was saved each time) or Jamie (who was stalked all over bloody Scotland by a madman sadistic rapist and who was ultimately violently brutalized to what... again, save Claire.)More than anything, I just think it was... lazy and probably a little careless to repeatedly use it as the driver for the plot.- I wasn't keen on the \"beating scene\". Again, I get that it's historically believable and I don't so much object to the beating itself so much as the fact that Jamie enjoyed it. That seemed OOC to me based on everything else he'd shown, and frankly, that took him down a few notches as a character for me.Really, like the amount of sexual violence, the level of general person on person violence/abuse was a little eh for me, too. Yes, people beat each other a lot back in those days, sometimes for very good reasons (i.e. parental discipline). But the author spent A LOT of time discussing it and focusing on it, throughout the entire novel. It wasn't clear to me what exactly she was trying to accomplish in doing so either. In other words, exactly what theme she was going for? Half the time it felt like she was trying to justify abuse by saying, \"Oh, it's just the times.\"ETA: Also, I forgot to mention this when I originally posted this review, but I got rather tired of the continual shooting/raping/beating the hell out of Jamie. More than once, I was like, \"Okay, that's enough. We get that he's tough and noble and has character. You can stop torturing him now. Move on to someone else.\" Like other things, I found it overly repetitive.- I think Randall was overdone as a villain. He came off as almost a caricature.- Lastly, and while it probably matters not to most readers (especially those reading for just the romance aspects), but it does matter to me, her time travel logic needed some major help. It's difficult to create a believable time traveling story in the first place, but the author didn't spend any real time making her version seem feasible.If you really think about where she was going with Geilie's date of time travel (1967) versus Claire's (1945) and the fact that Geilie was already in the past when Claire arrived, it leads you to the conclusion that the author's version of time travel is based on some notion that all time exists in the same moment rather than in a line or wave or various other versions some sci fi authors use. And that paradox can take you down a very deep and very confusing rabbit hole. Really, if she'd have left out the bit about Geilie coming from the future, it would have worked better. That she did have it there just made things more complicated than they needed to be.So... in conclusion, I suppose, as I said above, I liked it \"okay\". Some parts were quite enjoyable. Others made me want to throw my kindle (I literally did once). I'm definitely not in love with it like I know many are. But it was still an overall entertaining read.Also, as an aside, after having read some long, detailed summaries of the subsequent novels in this series, I've decided I won't be continuing. The later novels' plots are far too convoluted and really just not that interesting for me. I think I'll just pretend that it all ends with this book and be happy enough., error: This is actually a very difficult book for me to rate. Certain aspects of it were very good. Others, I didn't care for at all. I suppose I can say that as a whole I liked it \"okay\". Somewhere between a 2 and a 3, but I'm going to round down due to the seriousness of my dislikes.What worked for me:- Attention to detail (more on that below, however). It was very easy for me to visualize scenes and actions.- In general, the premise for the novel was interesting. And some parts of it were very exciting to read with lots of good drama.- Claire was in some ways a decently strong protagonist. I liked her smart mouth and I liked the way she pushed back against her male counterparts. For the most part, I liked her.- I like Jamie quite a bit (more than that below, however). I found him to be a very likable character and well fleshed out. He was a nice blend of good traits and bad, and he had a lot of depth to him. I'll say that I didn't find him quite as swoony as some do, but I did like him a lot. I loved the way he loved Claire. I bought it - the chemistry and his care for her. And there were more than a few scenes where their relationship was very touching.- I liked the tie-ins with history. The author seemed to have put quite a bit of research into this. It felt fairly authentic, at least as far as books such as this go.- Some of the secondaries were really well done.- As a whole, the writing was better than average.What didn't work for me:- First, this book needed a serious round of editing. I like long books and as I mentioned above, I liked the author's attention to detail. But this was long out of mostly author self indulgence. There were several scenes that just went on and on and on, going into far more detail than necessary, to the point of major plot distraction. And then other scenes really added nothing at all. Despite what the length of this novel would suggest, the plot was pretty simple. It was just repetitive and long-winded. I'd say a solid 1/3 of it could have been whacked and the story wouldn't have suffered at all.- Secondly, the abundence of sexual violence - rape, assault, etc - was a big turn off for me. Or really, not the existance of it in the book, but how the author chose to utilize it over and over as plot devices. I do get that rape and such was common historically. I'm not objecting to the author using it once or even twice. That's realistic.But EVERY plot point in this book was driven by it. Over and over, either against Claire (she was *almost* raped something like 5-6+ times... and was saved each time) or Jamie (who was stalked all over bloody Scotland by a madman sadistic rapist and who was ultimately violently brutalized to what... again, save Claire.)More than anything, I just think it was... lazy and probably a little careless to repeatedly use it as the driver for the plot.- I wasn't keen on the \"beating scene\".

            "Translation failed for: **If you're planning on reading this book, don't read my review. I give away the horribly disappointing ending. On second thought, don't read this book, read my review.**I know several people who have read this book, so I decided to give it a go. I was immediately intrigued by the subject of the book. The Fitzgerald family has one daughter, Kate, dying of kidney failure. The kidney failure is a result of her weary body's 14 year battle with a rare form of leukemia. Their other daughter, Anna, is a perfect donor match to Kate. The fact that Anna is a perfect match is no surprise considering Anna was conceived with Kate in mind. Anna was no accident; doctors specifically chose the embryo that would be a perfect genetic match for Kate's needs.Now thirteen years later, and several procedures later, Anna is refusing to donate a kidney. She seeks the legal help of Campbell Alexander, and together they petition the court for Anna's medical emancipation from her parents. Anna's argument is compelling. Simply, she argues \"it never stops.\" When Anna was born they gave her cord blood to Kate. Later Anna gave lymphocytes, then bone marrow, then granulocytes, then peripheral blood stem cells. And now she is expected to give a kidney. Anna feels like she only exists to perpetuate Kate's existence. At this point doctors don't even believe Kate would survive a kidney transplant, but her parents still want the procedure done.This is a fascinating plot, since there are no clear cut right/wrong answers. How do you weight the lives of these two young girls? The author came up with a brilliant grey pool of possibilities.But the book sank.While the writing is exceptional in small burst, it's most often barely digestible and often painful. The story is told from each characters' point of view, and this leads to a lot of flashbacks and unnecessary digressions. The flashbacks of the mother, Sara, are necessary as she tells the history of Kate's illness. But were also given a side plot between Campbell and Julia, Anna's guardian ad litem. And I promise that the author's writing takes a sudden dive for the 'painful' end of the spectrum when Julia is speaking. I was bored with the lame history of the high school romance between Campbell and Julia. They had a sudden breakup, and now 15 years later they still secretly pine for one another - blah. Let me first say that if my high school sweetheart broke my heart and I still haven't gotten over it FIFTEEN YEARS LATER, slap the shit out me!The plot is stupid: Julia was the poor girl that ended up in a rich school her oh-so-loving parents desperately got her into. She's the rebel with pink hair and no friends. Campbell is drawn to her because apparently no other girl in his rich kid school thought to dye their hair. Apparently rich kids don't do such crazy things.What was even worse was the dialogue between Julia and Campbell or Julia and her sister. A lot of horrible one-liners; just awful dialogue in general. I blame Picoult's editor. Why wasn't she told to cut all this crap out?The story when told through Jesse, the 18-year-old delinquent brother of Anna and Kate, is also generally ridiculous. We're given more cheesy dialogue and digressions that add very little to the main plot.Picoult could've easily cut out about 200 pages and had a much better story.Although the stories of Jesse, Campbell, and Julia are irritating, nothing is more infuriating than how the author ties up the story in the end. She creates this wonderful dilemma but (and here's where I get nasty) doesn't have the talent to pull it off. Instead of wading around in the murkiness of deciding between the possibility of saving one life (if only for a short while) and respecting the life and decisions of another, Picoult takes the easy way out. When on the stand, Anna now explains that she not only started the petition for personal or selfish reasons, but because Kate secretly asked her too. While this might be a very probable scenario in real life - a chronically ill patient simply wanting it to all end - I was interested in seeing where Picoult could take us without this shortcut. The starting topic no longer becomes such a controversy when the recipient doesn't want what the donor is offering. That's right, we learn that Anna was willing to donate her kidney until Kate told her not to. (Can you see the satin bow coming out, about to be neatly tied around all of this?)In the end, Anna is granted medical emancipation from her parents. Even still, Anna considers giving her kidney to Kate. On one hand she doesn't want to lose her sister, but another part of her realizes her life may be better once Kate is dead. But we never learn what Anna decides in the end, because the author commits the ultimate cop out. She kills Anna off. Anna gets into a horrible car accident where she's conveniently made brain dead, but still physically alive so her organs can be harvested. That's right! Kate gets her kidney after all and lives! This ending was complete bullshit. The ethical and moral questions that set this book up were abandoned in the end. In the end, no tough decisions needed to be made.Eight years later, Kate is alive and well. Her parents, although deeply effected by Anna's death, have managed to pull themselves back together. We're told that Brian, the father, had a drinking problem for a while after Anna's death, but not to worry - he clawed his way back to the family. Good for him. And Jesse the badass teenager who made moonshine in his room, dropped LSD, and who, oh by the way, was an ARSONIST, is now a decorated police officer. How nice; glad that whole setting elementary schools on fire stage passed for him.I felt that throughout the book the author was making a case for Anna and how invisible she felt in her own family. Anna desperately wanted to be in charge of her own life. Anna wanted to be seen as an individual, not Kate's lifeline. Instead of Kate always being giving a chance, Anna wanted a chance to become her own person. In the end, her creator, her author, didn't even care enough to find out what that might mean., error: **If you're planning on reading this book, don't read my review.

I'm not sure why, but it seems that they have this idea that Caucasian = hotness. Boys, being boys, well ... they snatch up every opportunity. What really bugs me though, is not the immense cheapness of these girls (and guys), but the extent to which they will go out there and hunt these western boys.The heroine of this book reminds me a lot of those girls. This one sentence wraps it up for me:\"I was a pretty dhampir, one who didn't mind getting into trouble and pulling crazy stunts. I became a novelty; they liked having me around for the fun of it.\"Just like those girls who also know these foreigners only keep them around for the \"fun\" of it, appealing to their Asian-fetish, “not minding” that they’re playing into the stereotype.Just like them, Rose Hathaway is the kind of girl who'd hook up with a guy just because he's hot. She'll be with one guy, but thinking about another. She is constantly thinking about getting with guys:\"You flirted with the other guys simply for the sake of flirting. You flirted with Jesse in the hopes of getting semi-naked with him. He was a royal Moroi, and he was so hot, he should have worn a warning: flammable sign.\"and yet when someone accuses her of being a slut, she's all indignant. What, if you don't go as far as sex, then it annuls any tendencies of sluttiness? Please. I have a lot of promiscuous friends - I'm not exactly wearing a promise ring myself - but at least have the decency to embrace your inner slut.What irritates me even more with this character is how she would then go about referring to other dhampirs who offer \"services\" to morois as \"bloodwhores\". Bitch, please - you're not so far off yourself. Hypocritical characters are just not my thing. ESPECIALLY when they don't realize they're being hypocritical, or when/if the author doesn't realize s/he's writing a hypocritical character.Now, there is a difference between confidence and arrogance; both I find charming in their own ways. But Rose Hathaway is neither. She is downright up herself, which is not a trait that I find endearing. I had to roll my eyes every time she described her sexiness...\"I knew I was pretty, but to Moroi boys, my body was more than just pretty: it was sexy in a risqué way.\"\"I knew perfectly well that there weren't a lot of girls at this school who looked as good in a bra as I did.\"The first one or two times were perhaps forgivable. But the third time around, I really couldn't help but groan. But in fact, Rose seems to be only obsessed with looks (which is odd, considering her \"occupation\" as a guardian); you'd think considering what she's been through, she'd be a little less shallow than that.\"Me. Turning into Alberta. Her...and all the other female guardians. They're all leathery and stuff. Fighting and training and always being outdoors - they aren't pretty anymore.\" I paused.\"This...this life. It destroys them. Their looks, I mean.\"But forget her vanity for a second. Let's take a look at her apparently \"redeeming\" characteristic; her loyalty to her best friend, Lissa. You know, the one whose relationship she sabotaged?\"Why don't you just leave her alone? Are you so messed up and desperate for attention that you can't tell when someone doesn't like you?\" He scowled. \"You're some crazy stalker, and she knows it. She's told me all about your weird obsession-how you're always hanging out in the attic together, how you set Ralf on fire to impress her. She thinks you're a freak, but she's too nice to say anything.\"...and for no other reason than jealousy. Oh, and because this dude comes from a shamed family. Never mind how much her best friend obviously adores him. Never mind how muchheobviously cares about her in return.All in all, I just couldn't sympathize for Rose. She was an attempt of a kick-ass, independent, empowered young girl - but she came across as conceited, hypocritical, and shallow.Then the princess girl? Lissa? I don't know ... she was just bland. None of the characters in the book stood out for me. Even the romance seemed kind of forced (not to mention predictable - but aren't they all?!). It seemed the only reason Dimitri and Rose had this vibe going on was because of their mutual hotness (a word frequently thrown out there in the book). There was this brief explanation of how it was also because of their shared extreme dedication in being guardians - which I didn't buy. I have an extreme dedication in journalism, but I don't fall in love with every dedicated journalists out there.Plot-wise... meh. Nothing special. The story was about a vampire and her half-human, half-vampire guardian, who had run away from a \"vampire academy\" and at the beginning of the book were captured and returned. The secret behind their escape was obviously a device to keep us hooked, but when it was finally revealed, it didn't seem too \"wow, omigod\" for me.The Vampires in this story didn't even seem like your traditional vampires, other than their weakness when exposed to direct sunlight, and their occasional \"feeding\". There was apparently another type of Vampire, which were called the \"strigoi\", which we didn't see much of; and even when we did, it wasn't even that exciting.Editing-wise... could be better. \"describrd\" on page 142 is one of the errors that I remembered. There were more, but I can't be bothered flipping through the pages to find them.In conclusion. Maybe I would've liked this better if I were... 15? 16?

ESPECIALLY when they don't realize they're being hypocritical, or when/if the author doesn't realize s/he's writing a hypocritical character.Now, there is a difference between confidence and arrogance; both I find charming in their own ways. But Rose Hathaway is neither. She is downright up herself, which is not a trait that I find endearing. I had to roll my eyes every time she described her sexiness...\"I knew I was pretty, but to Moroi boys, my body was more than just pretty: it was sexy in a risqué way.\"\"I knew perfectly well that there weren't a lot of girls at this school who looked as good in a bra as I did.\"The first one or two times were perhaps forgivable. But the third time around, I really couldn't help but groan. But in fact, Rose seems to be only obsessed with looks (which is odd, considering her \"occupation\" as a guardian); you'd think considering what she's been through, she'd be a little less shallow than that.\"Me. Turning into Alberta. Her...and all the other female guardians. They're all leathery and stuff. Fighting and training and always being outdoors - they aren't pretty anymore.\" I paused.\"This...this life. It destroys them. Their looks, I mean.\"But forget her vanity for a second. Let's take a look at her apparently \"redeeming\" characteristic; her loyalty to her best friend, Lissa. You know, the one whose relationship she sabotaged?\"Why don't you just leave her alone? Are you so messed up and desperate for attention that you can't tell when someone doesn't like you?\" He scowled. \"You're some crazy stalker, and she knows it. She's told me all about your weird obsession-how you're always hanging out in the attic together, how you set Ralf on fire to impress her. She thinks you're a freak, but she's too nice to say anything.\"...and for no other reason than jealousy. Oh, and because this dude comes from a shamed family. Never mind how much her best friend obviously adores him. Never mind how muchheobviously cares about her in return.All in all, I just couldn't sympathize for Rose. She was an attempt of a kick-ass, independent, empowered young girl - but she came across as conceited, hypocritical, and shallow.Then the princess girl? Lissa? I don't know ... she was just bland. None of the characters in the book stood out for me. Even the romance seemed kind of forced (not to mention predictable - but aren't they all?!). It seemed the only reason Dimitri and Rose had this vibe going on was because of their mutual hotness (a word frequently thrown out there in the book). There was this brief explanation of how it was also because of their shared extreme dedication in being guardians - which I didn't buy. I have an extreme dedication in journalism, but I don't fall in love with every dedicated journalists out there.Plot-wise... meh. Nothing special. The story was about a vampire and her half-human, half-vampire guardian, who had run away from a \"vampire academy\" and at the beginning of the book were captured and returned. The secret behind their escape was obviously a device to keep us hooked, but when it was finally revealed, it didn't seem too \"wow, omigod\" for me.The Vampires in this story didn't even seem like your traditional vampires, other than their weakness when exposed to direct sunlight, and their occasional \"feeding\". There was apparently another type of Vampire, which were called the \"strigoi\", which we didn't see much of; and even when we did, it wasn't even that exciting.Editing-wise... could be better. \"describrd\" on page 142 is one of the errors that I remembered. There were more, but I can't be bothered flipping through the pages to find them.In conclusion. Maybe I would've liked this better if I were... 15? 16? But then again, maybe not. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

That's the whole point ofMoby Dick.HOMER: Oh Lisa, the point ofMoby Dickis 'be yourself.'--The Simpsons, Season 15, Episode 5, “The Fat and the Furriest”(Ahoy, Matey! Thar be spoilers ahead).There, there. Stop your crying. You didn’t like Herman Melville’sMoby Dick? You didn't even finish it? I’m here to tell you, that’s okay. You’re still a good person. You will still be invited to Thanksgiving dinner. You won’t be arrested, incarcerated, or exiled. You will not be shunned (except by English majors; they will shun you). Your family and friends will still love you (or at least stand you). Your dog will still be loyal (your cat, though, will remain indifferent).Moby Dickcan be a humbling experience. Even if you get through it, you may be desperately asking yourself things like “why didn’t I like this” or \"am I totally missing something” or \"how long have I been sleeping?\" See,Moby Dickis the most famous novel in American history. It might bethegreat American novel. But in many ways, it’s like 3-D movies or Mount Rushmore: it’s tough to figure out why it’s such a big deal.I suppose any discussion aboutMoby Dickmust start with thematic considerations. It is, after all, “classic” literature, and must be experienced on multiple levels, if at all. So, what’s the point ofMoby Dick? Is it about obsession? The things that drive each of us in our ambitions, whether they be wealth, hate, prejudice or love? Is it a deconstruction of Puritan culture in colonial America? Is it a Joseph Campbell-style hero’s journey? Is it a good ol' yarn of men against the sea? Is it all of these things?Perhaps.Is it a colossal bore?Decidedly.Now, I hate to use that word, the b-word. Boring. It means so little. It means nothing. It is the ultimate grade-school criticism: subjective; vague; and expressing annoyance at having been forced to experience the thing at all. To say something is boring implies that nothing happens, when in fact, something is always happening. Whether or not that happening is exciting is another question.Having said all that, I foundMoby Dickboring in the purest sense of the word. On just about every page, I felt a distinct lack of interest. And this is not a response to the subject matter. I love sea stories. I enjoyed Nathaniel Philbrick’sIn the Heart of the Seaand Steven Spielberg’s adaptation ofJaws. Normally, a novel about an obsessed man trying to harpoon a terrifying monster would be right in my wheelhouse.What was the problem? More specifically, what was my problem? (Because despite what I say, most people are going to blame me rather than Melville).It all comes down to density. I’ve never actually harpooned a whale (or anything, for that matter), but I can only assume that it is slightly easier than finishing this turgid, mammoth work of literature. I found it almost impenetrable. Like reading Hawthorne, except it doesn't end, ever. I tried reading it three different times, and failed. In a meta turn of events, the novel became like my white whale, elusive and cagey, an arch opponent.I would get through the first few chapters all right. The dinner at the Spouter-Inn. The homo-erotically charged night two men share in bed. Melville’s exquisitely detailed description of his breakfast companions:You could plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage. That man next to him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic yawn, but slightly bleached withal;hedoubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.Somewhere in the neighborhood of the fortieth page, when Father Mapple starts to give his sermon, I’d start to get a little restless. A few pages into his fire-and-brimstone screed, my mind would wander. By the end of the chapter, I’d realize that instead of paying attention to the text, I’d actually started to amuse myself by trying to calculate my income taxes in my head. And then I’d quit.During one of my periodic bouts of self-improvement (which I regularly intersperse with bouts of day-drinking), I decided to finish this damn thing once and for all. To do this, I hit upon a plan: I brought it to work and forced myself to read twenty pages a day at lunch. No more surfing the internet or listening to podcasts. No more chatting with coworkers. Until I finished, I would dedicate the hour to 20 pages of Melville. As a result I: (1) finished the book; and (2) grew to hate lunch (which is really quite a sad turn of events).What did I learn?Not too much.Moby Dickis about a milquetoast named Ishmael who sets out on a whaling ship called thePequod. Like many literary heroes, he is a bit of an outcast. Also, following in the tradition of Charles Dickens’ tedious first-person narrators, he is a bit of a cipher. Ishmael doesn't do much, except offer endless exegeses on every aspect of whaling, as well as stultifying digressions on topics too numerous to count (don’t miss the chapter about how the color white can be evil!). Ishmael's pedagogic ramblings will soon have you pleading for the whale – or a squid or an eel or a berserk seagull – to eat him, and eat him quickly (but painfully) so the book will end.ThePequodis commanded by Captain Ahab, the one-legged nut who is obsessed with finding the whale that ate his now-absent limb. He's sort of the 19th century version of the psycho ex-boyfriend who just can't seem to let go the past. Ahab is an interesting character in the abstract. Profoundly, almost suicidally driven. The obvious progenitor of Robert Shaw’s captivating performance as Quint in Spielberg’sJaws. However, in the context of the book's thees and thous and utterly excessive verbiage and arcane sentence structure, the sheen wears off mighty quick. It’s one of those instances in which I’d much prefer someone to tell me about Ahab, rather than read about him myself. (In other words, I need an interpreter to translate from Ye Olde English to English).The challenging language permeatesMoby Dick. Melville writes in a overly-verbose, grandiloquent style. His book is packed with symbols and metaphors and allusions and nautical terms. There were very few pages in which I didn't have to stop reading and flip to the back of the book, to read the explanatory notes or consult the glossary. There are digressions and soliloquies and even, at certain points, stage directions. It is also a primer on whaling, in case you wanted to learn:ThePequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was hoisted against the ship’s side – about half way out of the sea, so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over it, by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that blood-dripping head hung to thePequod’s waist like the giant Holofernes’s from the girdle of Judith.Maybe you are familiar with the giant Holfernes and Judith’s girdle. Maybe you want to be familiar with them. If so, by all means, proceed.Melville’s other notable character is Queequeg, the South Seas cannibal with whom Ishmael shares a bed at the Spouter-Inn (a scene that has launched a thousand dissertations). Ishmael’s best friend on thePequod, Queequeg expresses the duality of man: outwardly a tattooed savage, he is also purveyor of what might be termed Christian ethics (he gets along with people; he turns the other cheek; and he’s willing to jump into the ocean to save a stranger’s life).The rest of the cast is too large to get into. Besides, they all run together in my mind. For example, I can’t tell you off the top of my head whether Starbuck or Stubb was the first mate. Frankly, I don't really care. They all end up in the same place. Hint: think Jonah. (Melville really harps on this Biblical allusion, as he harps on everything).None of this is to say thatMoby Dicklacks any charms. There are passages of great beauty. For instance, there is a moment when Pip, the black cabin boy, falls out of one of the longboats and is left in the ocean. Upon being rescued, he is irrevocably changed:The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmate's called him mad.I’m not going to lie and say I have the slightest idea of what that all means, but it sure is pretty. I suppose that was part of the allure thatMoby Dickheld for me. Even though I often wanted to quit, every once in awhile, a passage would jump out at me and smack me across the face with its classicalness. Unfortunately, you have to wade through so much, the mind becomes numb.Moby Dickis quite simply a slog. It is tedious. Detail-laden. Attention-demanding. Then, after 56 billion pages, the climax comes in an instant, and in a matter of a few pages, everything you learned about the ship, the knots that held the sails, the crewmembers, Ahab – everything – is for naught, because it's all gone, and the sea rolls on, as it has for a thousand years. In a way, it's kind of cool to do it that way; I mean, that's life. You don't always get a great death scene. But on the other hand, what a gyp!I realize my tone is preemptively defensive. After all, I consider myself a high functioning individual. Like you (I assume), I don’t like being told: “You just don’t get it.” Oh no, I get it. At least, I tried very hard to get it. I just didn't like it. And I’ll admit, I didn't like having to try so hard. This complaint is not simply a function of having my brain rotted by soda pop, candy, and first-person-shooter video games. Rather, there is an important argument to be made for clarity. Some say Melville’s stylized prose is elegant; I think it’s tortured. Some find his allusions illuminating; I find them hopelessly outdated. Some discover a higher pleasure in unpacking each complex theme; I just wanted to push Ishmael over the gunwale or hang him from the yardarm.Melville can gussy things up as much as he wants. He can toss off references to 19th century prizefighters, Schiller’s poetry, and the Bible; he can discourse on civilization and savagery, on man and God; he can teach you every knot needed to sail a whaler; and he can draw out enough metaphors to keep SparksNotes in business for the next hundred years.Melville can do all these things, but he can’t hide the fact that this is a story about some guys going fishing. That’s it. That simple story is the vessel for Melville’s explorations. Upon this he heaps his complications. Whether Melville’s technique is effective or not, or whether Melville has convinced you that it’s effective, is an open question.Well, not to me. I think I’ve answered the question.In short, I would rather be harpooned, fall off my ship, get eaten by a great white shark, and then have the great white shark swallowed by a whale, then read this book ever again.I can’t get any clearer than that., error: LISA: Dad, you can't take revenge on an animal.

His book is packed with symbols and metaphors and allusions and nautical terms. There were very few pages in which I didn't have to stop reading and flip to the back of the book, to read the explanatory notes or consult the glossary. There are digressions and soliloquies and even, at certain points, stage directions. It is also a primer on whaling, in case you wanted to learn:ThePequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was hoisted against the ship’s side – about half way out of the sea, so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over it, by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that blood-dripping head hung to thePequod’s waist like the giant Holofernes’s from the girdle of Judith.Maybe you are familiar with the giant Holfernes and Judith’s girdle. Maybe you want to be familiar with them. If so, by all means, proceed.Melville’s other notable character is Queequeg, the South Seas cannibal with whom Ishmael shares a bed at the Spouter-Inn (a scene that has launched a thousand dissertations). Ishmael’s best friend on thePequod, Queequeg expresses the duality of man: outwardly a tattooed savage, he is also purveyor of what might be termed Christian ethics (he gets along with people; he turns the other cheek; and he’s willing to jump into the ocean to save a stranger’s life).The rest of the cast is too large to get into. Besides, they all run together in my mind. For example, I can’t tell you off the top of my head whether Starbuck or Stubb was the first mate. Frankly, I don't really care. They all end up in the same place. Hint: think Jonah. (Melville really harps on this Biblical allusion, as he harps on everything).None of this is to say thatMoby Dicklacks any charms. There are passages of great beauty. For instance, there is a moment when Pip, the black cabin boy, falls out of one of the longboats and is left in the ocean. Upon being rescued, he is irrevocably changed:The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmate's called him mad.I’m not going to lie and say I have the slightest idea of what that all means, but it sure is pretty. I suppose that was part of the allure thatMoby Dickheld for me. Even though I often wanted to quit, every once in awhile, a passage would jump out at me and smack me across the face with its classicalness. Unfortunately, you have to wade through so much, the mind becomes numb.Moby Dickis quite simply a slog. It is tedious. Detail-laden. Attention-demanding. Then, after 56 billion pages, the climax comes in an instant, and in a matter of a few pages, everything you learned about the ship, the knots that held the sails, the crewmembers, Ahab – everything – is for naught, because it's all gone, and the sea rolls on, as it has for a thousand years. In a way, it's kind of cool to do it that way; I mean, that's life. You don't always get a great death scene. But on the other hand, what a gyp!I realize my tone is preemptively defensive. After all, I consider myself a high functioning individual. Like you (I assume), I don’t like being told: “You just don’t get it.” Oh no, I get it. At least, I tried very hard to get it. I just didn't like it. And I’ll admit, I didn't like having to try so hard. This complaint is not simply a function of having my brain rotted by soda pop, candy, and first-person-shooter video games. Rather, there is an important argument to be made for clarity. Some say Melville’s stylized prose is elegant; I think it’s tortured. Some find his allusions illuminating; I find them hopelessly outdated. Some discover a higher pleasure in unpacking each complex theme; I just wanted to push Ishmael over the gunwale or hang him from the yardarm.Melville can gussy things up as much as he wants. He can toss off references to 19th century prizefighters, Schiller’s poetry, and the Bible; he can discourse on civilization and savagery, on man and God; he can teach you every knot needed to sail a whaler; and he can draw out enough metaphors to keep SparksNotes in business for the next hundred years.Melville can do all these things, but he can’t hide the fact that this is a story about some guys going fishing. That’s it. That simple story is the vessel for Melville’s explorations. Upon this he heaps his complications. Whether Melville’s technique is effective or not, or whether Melville has convinced you that it’s effective, is an open question.Well, not to me. I think I’ve answered the question.In short, I would rather be harpooned, fall off my ship, get eaten by a great white shark, and then have the great white shark swallowed by a whale, then read this book ever again.I can’t get any clearer than that. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

            "Translation failed for: My greatest disappointment in'The Screwtape Letters'was that Lewis was not able to demonstrate what made his good people good or his bad people bad. The closest he got to defining goodness was that you could tell the good people from the vague aura of light that surrounded them--and which even shone in their cat. In this book, the cat is much bigger.Aslan had no character, he was just a big, dull stand-in. Lewis often tells us how great he is, but never demonstrates what it is that makes him great or impressive. Sure, he helps the kids, but all that makes him is a plot facilitator. He also has his big Jesus moment, but that has the same problem as the original: if he already knows that there will be no lasting negative outcome, how much of a sacrifice is it, really?But then, Aslan isn't based on the original fig-cursing, church-rejecting, rebel Jesus, but the whitewashed version. Like Mickey Mouse, Jesus started out as an oddball troublemaker with his fair share of personality, but becoming the smiling face of a multinational organization bent on world domination takes a lot out of a mascot, whether your magic castle is in California or Rome.Such a visible figure must become universally appealing, universally friendly and loving, lest some subset of followers feel left out. And it's this 'Buddy Christ' tradition from which Aslan springs. Devoid of insight, wisdom, or charm, Aslan is just here to do all the things that our protagonists can't do.This also beggars the question: why didn't Aslan just take care of all this stuff long before the kids arrived? Why did all the animals and fairies and giants have to suffer the pain of an endless winter? We're never given any good reason Aslan had to wait for the kids--since in the end, he does it all on his own, anyways. Sure, Lewis mentions something vague about a prophecy, but in fantasy, prophecy is always a bandaid authors stick over their plot holes:'Uh, the shlubby nobody is a hero because the prophecy says he is--he defeats the ultimate evil because the prophecy says he can'.The only thing the kids do is help run the battle, but this is only necessary because Aslan is absent, and he's only absent because the kids screwed up, meaning the entire thing would have gone off without a hitch if they had never showed up in the first place.In that regard, I have to say Lewis did an excellent job boiling down Christianity into a fable, and leaving theproblem of evilcompletely intact. Some readers suggest that Aslan lets the queen take over to teach the kids a lesson, but is it really worthwhile to let all the inhabitants of a kingdom suffer a century of misery just to teach a few kids about the true meaning of friendship?The villain is just as poorly-constructed, and seems less concerned with defeating her enemies than with being pointlessly capricious. She manages to trick one of the children, but instead of taking advantage of this fact, she immediately makes it clear that she tricked him. I mean, how did someone that incompetent take over in the first place?Selectively stupid characters are silly and convenient, especially as villains, because this completely undermines their role as foil. It is impressive when characters overcome challenges, but not when challenges simply crumble before them. The children are lucky the Queen was more of afart-stealing Old Nickthan a Miltonian Satan, otherwise they never would have stood a chance.It is interesting to look at how many Christian authors have tried to reconcile their faith with complex fairy mythologies; not that Christianity doesn't have its ownmagical fairy tales, but these other traditions are not exactly compatible. Dante has Virgil lead him through hell, the Buddha wasmade into a saint, holidays were given new meanings (even if they often keptold symbols and names), and magical monsters were also given a place in the new faith.In the Middle Ages, monks compiled'Bestiaries', which described the roles of dragons, unicorns, and real animals in Christian synbolism; there were even century-spanning debates aboutwhether dog-headed men were descended from Adam. These books were rarely accurate, but allowed Christian theology to adopt many stories and superstitions from earlier periods; for instance, the connection between unicorns and virginity or the belief that pelicans fed their own blood to their young, in imitation ofcommunion.So Lewis' attempt to take myth and adapt it to a Christian cosmology is hardly new--there is a long and storied tradition explored throughout the Chivalric period and recognizable today in books likeThe Once and Future King, but Lewis doesn't do a very good job of reconciling these disparate mythologies.Like most Protestants, Lewis' religion was a modern one--not magical and mystical, but reasonable and utilitarian. He did not draw on the elaborate, convoluted apocrypha of hallucinatory monsters and miracles that mystics obsess over, instead, he made a small, sane, reasonable magical world--which rather defeats the point. It is unfortunate that many of today's readers think of Lewis' writings as defining English fairy tales, since his late additions to the genre are not original, nor are they particularly well-executed examples.Many authors have come to the genre with much more imagination, a deeper sense of wonder, and a more far-reaching exploration of magic. We have examples fromKipling,Lewis Carroll,Dunsany,Eddison,Morris, and even modern updates byGaimanandClarke. Lewis, like Tolkien, may be a well-known example, but both are rather short-sighted, and neither one achieves as much as the many talented authors who came before.I'm not saying Lewis is bad, merely that he is unremarkable, and is hardly preeminent in fantasy, or even in children's fantasy. However, I do think his fundamental message is a bad one, even if he didn't realize he was creating it.In all his worlds, all his stories, he takes the sorts of people he dislikes, defines them as 'evil', then sets himself apart from them. There is no attempt to comprehend or to come to mutual understanding. I cannot respect a book which encourages people to vilify what they don't understand and to call isolation righteous. If any worldview deserves the epithet of 'evil', it is the sort of willful, prideful, self-indulgent ignorance Lewis displays.My List of Suggested Fantasy Books, error: My greatest disappointment in'The Screwtape Letters'was that Lewis was not able to demonstrate what made his good people good or his bad people bad. The closest he got to defining goodness was that you could tell the good people from the vague aura of light that surrounded them--and which even shone in their cat. In this book, the cat is much bigger.Aslan had no character, he was just a big, dull stand-in. Lewis often tells us how great he is, but never demonstrates what it is that makes him great or impressive. Sure, he helps the kids, but all that makes him is a plot facilitator. He also has his big Jesus moment, but that has the same problem as the original: if he already knows that there will be no lasting negative outcome, how much of a sacrifice is it, really?But then, Aslan isn't based on the original fig-cursing, church-rejecting, rebel Jesus, but the whitewashed version. Like Mickey Mouse, Jesus started out as an oddball troublemaker with his fair share of personality, but becoming the smiling face of a multinational organization bent on world domination takes a lot out of a mascot, whether your magic castle is in California or Rome.Such a visible figure must become universally appealing, universally friendly and loving, lest some subset of followers feel left out. And it's this 'Buddy Christ' tradition from which Aslan springs. Devoid of insight, wisdom, or charm, Aslan is just here to do all the things that our protagonists can't do.This also beggars the question: why didn't Aslan just take care of all this stuff long before the kids arrived? Why did all the animals and fairies and giants have to suffer the pain of an endless winter? We're never given any good reason Aslan had to wait for the kids--since in the end, he does it all on his own, anyways. Sure, Lewis mentions something vague about a prophecy, but in fantasy, prophecy is always a bandaid authors stick over their plot holes:'Uh, the shlubby nobody is a hero because the prophecy says he is--he defeats the ultimate evil because the prophecy says he can'.The only thing the kids do is help run the battle, but this is only necessary because Aslan is absent, and he's only absent because the kids screwed up, meaning the entire thing would have gone off without a hitch if they had never showed up in the first place.In that regard, I have to say Lewis did an excellent job boiling down Christianity into a fable, and leaving theproblem of evilcompletely intact. Some readers suggest that Aslan lets the queen take over to teach the kids a lesson, but is it really worthwhile to let all the inhabitants of a kingdom suffer a century of misery just to teach a few kids about the true meaning of friendship?The villain is just as poorly-constructed, and seems less concerned with defeating her enemies than with being pointlessly capricious. She manages to trick one of the children, but instead of taking advantage of this fact, she immediately makes it clear that she tricked him. I mean, how did someone that incompetent take over in the first place?Selectively stupid characters are silly and convenient, especially as villains, because this completely undermines their role as foil. It is impressive when characters overcome challenges, but not when challenges simply crumble before them. The children are lucky the Queen was more of afart-stealing Old Nickthan a Miltonian Satan, otherwise they never would have stood a chance.It is interesting to look at how many Christian authors have tried to reconcile their faith with complex fairy mythologies; not that Christianity doesn't have its ownmagical fairy tales, but these other traditions are not exactly compatible. Dante has Virgil lead him through hell, the Buddha wasmade into a saint, holidays were given new meanings (even if they often keptold symbols and names), and magical monsters were also given a place in the new faith.In the Middle Ages, monks compiled'Bestiaries', which described the roles of dragons, unicorns, and real animals in Christian synbolism; there were even century-spanning debates aboutwhether dog-headed men were descended from Adam. These books were rarely accurate, but allowed Christian theology to adopt many stories and superstitions from earlier periods; for instance, the connection between unicorns and virginity or the belief that pelicans fed their own blood to their young, in imitation ofcommunion.So Lewis' attempt to take myth and adapt it to a Christian cosmology is hardly new--there is a long and storied tradition explored throughout the Chivalric period and recognizable today in books likeThe Once and Future King, but Lewis doesn't do a very good job of reconciling these disparate mythologies.Like most Protestants, Lewis' religion was a modern one--not magical and mystical, but reasonable and utilitarian. He did not draw on the elaborate, convoluted apocrypha of hallucinatory monsters and miracles that mystics obsess over, instead, he made a small, sane, reasonable magical world--which rather defeats the point. It is unfortunate that many of today's readers think of Lewis' writings as defining English fairy tales, since his late additions to the genre are not original, nor are they particularly well-executed examples.Many authors have come to the genre with much more imagination, a deeper sense of wonder, and a more far-reaching exploration of magic. We have examples fromKipling,Lewis Carroll,Dunsany,Eddison,Morris, and even modern updates byGaimanandClarke. Lewis, like Tolkien, may be a well-known example, but both are rather short-sighted, and neither one achieves as much as the many talented authors who came before.I'm not saying Lewis is bad, merely that he is unremarkable, and is hardly preeminent in fantasy, or even in children's fantasy.

            "Translation failed for: I find it really weird how many American media products have the word \"American\" in the title. Obviously, this; a few weeks back I also readAmerican Rust. You've got yourAmerican Beauty,American Ninja,An American Werewolf in London.American Psycho.American Sniper.American Pie,American Dad,American Graffiti. What is going on here, what are they trying to prove?? I really don't understand it. I mean you'd never get \"British Beauty\", \"French Psycho\", would you? That just seems completely laughable.Anyway, I really didn't get this book. It made no sense to me at all. I mean it's a fun conceit, that gods are living among men in modern day America, desperate to regain the faith they once commanded, but I just felt like it wasn't thought through properly. It presents itself as being predicated on the idea that ‘America is a bad land for gods’ – this is something that characters keep saying to one another, moodily, that America is a really bad land for gods – and this is apparently why all the gods are now living hand-to-mouth existences as drifters or menial labourers.Only – huh? Are we talking about the same America here? The one where 51 percent of the population think that humans were created by a divine being, and a further 40 percent think they were created by evolution which was set in motion by a divine being (leaving, as Tim Minchin said, a very small percentage of Americans who are right)? Is that the America that is supposed to be a bad land for gods? Do me a favour, it must be one of the most religious countries in the western world. I've driven through my share of rural Tennessee, where much ofAmerican Godstakes place, and one of the most striking things about these communities is the fact that there seems to be one church for every six or seven houses. God is invoked on the currency, on the news, by the head of state, and in schoolrooms every morning by little kids.This is what is so frustrating about the book, because it seems like a brilliant chance to examine religion in the US in a cool and interesting way – but it doesn't. It either doesn't dare or it doesn't bother. I mean – if you're going to run with this idea that gods are walking around, with the more powerful deities being those who have the most believers, then where the fuck is Yahweh? I'm supposed to believe that Anubis is twatting around driving a hearse in fucking Cairo, IL. – despite the fact that no one in the history of America has ever worshipped Anubis – and yet Jesus doesn't make a single appearance? Somehow it's OK to play around with foreign gods that seem quaint or folkloric, but monotheism's off the table. It just didn't make any sense to me.¹Instead, what we have to propel the narrative along is just a kind of comic-book war that we're supposed to care about. So although there were quite a few scenes that had me flipping the pages with engagement, there was always this nagging feeling that none of it really meant anything and that I didn't really care very much what happened to anyone. It doesn't help that the protagonist (with the dreadful name of ‘Shadow Moon’) is, for a central character, annoyingly passive and lacking in personality (although the goddesses he encounters still have a remarkable habit of wanting to have sex with him).As for the writing style, well, it's fine, but it has absolutely no flair. There's quite an interesting bit in the Acknowledgements where Gaiman thanks many of his beta-readers and editors for spotting ‘stray and unintentional anglicisms’, presumably so he could remove them; this I think is something that contributes to the featureless blandness of his style. I'm not saying he is unentitled to this voice or anything like that – his wife is American, he lives in America, this is totally an authentic voice for him. It's just not one that has any character. It works in a kind of tab-A-into-slot-B way.This is certainly not a bad book and it's quite readable – I think I'm just disappointed because I had unfairly high hopes, and I liked the concept, and I have a lot of friends who really enjoyed it. For me it was just a bit baffling and cartoony. In the same way thatHis Dark Materialsis like a children's story for grown-ups,American Godsfelt like an adult story for children. This is my third Neil Gaiman book (afterSandmanandSmoke and Mirrors) and they have all been underwhelming; I think I'll just leave him alone now, since I'm sure they deserve higher ratings than I'm prepared to give them, but that's what you get when I try and squeeze in a review at 01:23 am in a foreign city when I still have another two hours' work to do before I can go to bed.¹This \"Tenth Anniversary Edition\" includes in its appendices a brief section in which Jesus does, in fact make a brief appearance. This was cut from the original published version, and you can see why; it is very short and it raises more questions than it answers. The problem is, these are the questions the book should have been about., error: Uważam, że to naprawdę dziwne, jak wiele amerykańskich produktów medialnych ma słowo „amerykański” w tytule. Oczywiście, że tak; kilka tygodni temu przeczytałem też American Rust. Masz American Beauty, American Ninja, An American Werewolf in London, American Psycho, American Sniper, American Pie, American Dad, American Graffiti. Co tu się dzieje, co oni próbują udowodnić?? Naprawdę tego nie rozumiem. Mam na myśli, że nigdy nie zrozumiesz „British Beauty”, „French Psycho”, prawda? To wydaje się po prostu całkowicie śmieszne. W każdym razie, naprawdę nie zrozumiałem tej książki. W ogóle nie miała dla mnie sensu. Mam na myśli, że to zabawny koncept, że bogowie żyją wśród ludzi we współczesnej Ameryce, zdesperowani, by odzyskać wiarę, którą kiedyś nakazali, ale po prostu czułem, że nie zostało to odpowiednio przemyślane. Przedstawia się jako oparta na idei, że „Ameryka jest złą ziemią dla bogów” – to coś, co postacie ciągle sobie powtarzają, ponuro, że Ameryka jest naprawdę złą ziemią dla bogów – i to jest najwyraźniej powód, dla którego wszyscy bogowie teraz żyją z dnia na dzień jako włóczędzy lub robotnicy najemni. Tylko – co? Czy mówimy o tej samej Ameryce? O tej, w której 51 procent populacji uważa, że ​​ludzie zostali stworzeni przez istotę boską, a kolejne 40 procent uważa, że ​​zostali stworzeni przez ewolucję, którą wprawiła w ruch istota boska (pozostawiając, jak powiedział Tim Minchin, bardzo mały odsetek Amerykanów, którzy mają rację)? Czy to jest ta Ameryka, która ma być złą ziemią dla bogów? Zrób mi przysługę, musi to być jeden z najbardziej religijnych krajów w świecie zachodnim. Przejechałem przez moją część wiejskiego Tennessee, gdzie odbywa się większość amerykańskich stawek bogów, i jedną z najbardziej uderzających rzeczy w tych społecznościach jest fakt, że wydaje się, że jest jeden kościół na sześć lub siedem domów. Bóg jest wzywany na walucie, w wiadomościach, przez głowę państwa i w klasach szkolnych każdego ranka przez małe dzieci. To jest to, co jest tak frustrujące w tej książce, ponieważ wydaje się ona genialną okazją do zbadania religii w USA w fajny i interesujący sposób – ale tak nie jest. Albo nie odważa się, albo nie zawraca sobie tym głowy. Mam na myśli – jeśli zamierzasz podążać za tym pomysłem, że bogowie chodzą dookoła, a najpotężniejsze bóstwa to te, które mają najwięcej wyznawców, to gdzie, kurwa, jest Jahwe? Mam uwierzyć, że Anubis kręci się i prowadzi karawan w pieprzonym Kairze, IL. – pomimo faktu, że nikt w historii Ameryki nigdy nie czcił Anubisa – a mimo to Jezus nie pojawia się ani razu? Jakoś można bawić się obcymi bogami, którzy wydają się dziwaczni lub folklorystyczni, ale monoteizm nie wchodzi w grę. Po prostu nie miało to dla mnie sensu.¹Zamiast tego, to, co musimy napędzać narrację, to po prostu pewnego rodzaju wojna komiksowa, która powinna nas obchodzić. Więc chociaż było całkiem sporo scen, które sprawiły, że przewracałem strony z zaangażowaniem, zawsze miałem to irytujące uczucie, że nic z tego tak naprawdę nie znaczyło i że tak naprawdę nie obchodziło mnie, co się z kimkolwiek stało. Nie pomaga fakt, że protagonista (o okropnym imieniu „Shadow Moon”) jest, jak na główną postać, irytująco bierny i pozbawiony osobowości (chociaż boginie, które spotyka, nadal mają niezwykły zwyczaj chęci uprawiania z nim seksu).Jeśli chodzi o styl pisania, cóż, jest w porządku, ale nie ma absolutnie żadnego polotu. Jest całkiem interesujący fragment w Podziękowaniach, gdzie Gaiman dziękuje wielu swoim beta-czytelnikom i redaktorom za wyłapanie „zabłąkanych i niezamierzonych anglicyzmów”, prawdopodobnie po to, aby mógł je usunąć; myślę, że to coś, co przyczynia się do bezcechowej nijakości jego stylu. Nie mówię, że nie ma prawa do tego głosu ani nic takiego – jego żona jest Amerykanką, on mieszka w Ameryce, to całkowicie autentyczny głos dla niego. Po prostu nie ma on żadnej postaci. Działa to w taki sposób, że zakładka A wsuwa się w szczelinę B. To z pewnością nie jest zła książka i jest całkiem czytelna – myślę, że jestem po prostu rozczarowany, ponieważ miałem niesprawiedliwie wysokie nadzieje i spodobał mi się koncept, a mam wielu przyjaciół, którym się naprawdę podobała. Dla mnie była po prostu trochę zagadkowa i kreskówkowa. Podobnie jak Jego Mroczne Materie jest jak opowieść dla dzieci dla dorosłych, Amerykańscy Bogowie wydawali się być opowieścią dla dorosłych dla dzieci. To moja trzecia książka Neila Gaimana (po Sandmanie i Dymie i lustrach) i wszystkie były rozczarowujące; Myślę, że zostawię go teraz w spokoju, ponieważ jestem pewien, że zasługują na wyższe oceny, niż jestem gotów im dać, ale tak właśnie się dzieje, gdy próbuję wcisnąć recenzję o 01:23 w nocy w obcym mieście, kiedy mam jeszcze dwie godziny pracy do zrobienia, zanim pójdę spać.¹W dodatku do tego „Tenth Anniversary Edition” znajduje się krótki fragment, w którym Jezus rzeczywiście się pojawia. Został on wycięty z oryginalnej opublikowanej wersji i widać dlaczego; jest bardzo krótki i stawia więcej pytań, niż udziela odpowiedzi. Problem w tym, że to są pytania, o których powinna być ta książka. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: Edit (1 May, 2023):Okay so, i wrote my previous review 3 years ago when i was an angry teenager and i didn't want to update this since it was mypersonalopinion at that time (and i totally accept that i wasn't being the most critical person in my review) but since (some) \"fans\" of this certain book claim to be \"changing the society\" and being \"extemely open to others thoughts\" and \"diversity\" but can't even give people the margin toexpress their thoughts on a book on a sitemeant to express your thoughts about books, i decided to update things a little and maybe write some more critical points.Opinion No. 1:SoC is extremely slow paced. Go argue with the wall if you can't stomach that fact. And i don't like the fact that a book about a freaking heist was slow paced. This book could've been over in 100 pages but it dragged so much. I've never ever been a fan of slow paced books. Even if every other thing is perfect, the slow pacing destroys things for me.Thereweresome good quotes tho.Opinion No. 2:This book would've been better if all characters had been older. YES i know it's fantasy and the author can do whatever they want but didn't that beloved show of y'all's favvvvvv book cast actors which were ranging from 25-30?? I didn't see anyone screaming then about how they're older. Everyone was just happy. But when the critics of this book say that the characters should be older, then we're \"attention seekers\" bah.And let me tell you what the show did better:- it paced the story better.- the age of the characters BETTER suited the things that they were doing.which immediately made the show more likable.Opinion No. 3:I don't like too many tragic backstories. And i definitely didn't like that every single character had one. Maybe there are irl groups pulling heists like this where all of them have had a tragic past. Maybe there are people who gain happiness and comfort from this book. But umm? this is a book in the end. If you have the ticket to love it, then i/other people have the ticket to dislike it too yk? It doesn't make us bad people who don't have \"empathy\". It just makes us people who don't like a certain thing.Opinion No. 4:Some people like this kind of stuff. GREAT FOR YOU. Some people don't like it. GREAT FOR PEOPLE LIKE US TOO. We're not commenting under the reviews raving about this book. We're not being angry at them. We !! just !! don't !! like !! something !! If someone likes this book or loves it or it's their entire life orwhateverthen it's great for them. THIS IS ALL JUST AN OPINION?And for people who claim to be the most open minded fandom who support every kind of freaking diversity known to man, some of you sure aren't what you'd like to believe lol.That being said, some fans of this book have commented under my review and told me that they loved my review and it made them laugh even though they liked this book and THAT is being understanding. THAT is being open minded. THAT is being a person who knows others have opinions (i have a special place in my heart for these people btw).Anyhow, i hope that y'all can give it a fucking break. Not everyone has to love something that you love or have a high opinion of. If you don't like my review then move over.OG Review:Aaah. To hate a series everyone loves ... feels bad dude. I have been known to have unpopular opinions in the past and my friends just tell me to \"lower my expectations\" but please answer me :If a book has an average of 4.45 rating, If that book is in the 'favorites' shelf of almost all of your friends, If that book is going to be developed into a TV show, If you open a user on goodreads and they have their username including the words \"Kaz\" and \"Brekker\", If they have mentioned in their about section that they will only befriend you 'if' you 'love' this book, If it takes you nearly five minutes to find a one star review of a book ...

THAT andTHIS IS JUST MY NIGHTMARE COME TO LIFE.Anyway that's all i can think right now. I will rant more when my sugar bowl is full., error: Edit (1 May, 2023):Okay so, i wrote my previous review 3 years ago when i was an angry teenager and i didn't want to update this since it was mypersonalopinion at that time (and i totally accept that i wasn't being the most critical person in my review) but since (some) \"fans\" of this certain book claim to be \"changing the society\" and being \"extemely open to others thoughts\" and \"diversity\" but can't even give people the margin toexpress their thoughts on a book on a sitemeant to express your thoughts about books, i decided to update things a little and maybe write some more critical points.Opinion No. 1:SoC is extremely slow paced. Go argue with the wall if you can't stomach that fact. And i don't like the fact that a book about a freaking heist was slow paced. This book could've been over in 100 pages but it dragged so much. I've never ever been a fan of slow paced books. Even if every other thing is perfect, the slow pacing destroys things for me.Thereweresome good quotes tho.Opinion No. 2:This book would've been better if all characters had been older. YES i know it's fantasy and the author can do whatever they want but didn't that beloved show of y'all's favvvvvv book cast actors which were ranging from 25-30?? I didn't see anyone screaming then about how they're older. Everyone was just happy. But when the critics of this book say that the characters should be older, then we're \"attention seekers\" bah.And let me tell you what the show did better:- it paced the story better.- the age of the characters BETTER suited the things that they were doing.which immediately made the show more likable.Opinion No. 3:I don't like too many tragic backstories. And i definitely didn't like that every single character had one. Maybe there are irl groups pulling heists like this where all of them have had a tragic past. Maybe there are people who gain happiness and comfort from this book. But umm? this is a book in the end. If you have the ticket to love it, then i/other people have the ticket to dislike it too yk? It doesn't make us bad people who don't have \"empathy\". It just makes us people who don't like a certain thing.Opinion No. 4:Some people like this kind of stuff. GREAT FOR YOU. Some people don't like it. GREAT FOR PEOPLE LIKE US TOO. We're not commenting under the reviews raving about this book. We're not being angry at them. We !! just !! don't !! like !! something !! If someone likes this book or loves it or it's their entire life orwhateverthen it's great for them. THIS IS ALL JUST AN OPINION?And for people who claim to be the most open minded fandom who support every kind of freaking diversity known to man, some of you sure aren't what you'd like to believe lol.That being said, some fans of this book have commented under my review and told me that they loved my review and it made them laugh even though they liked this book and THAT is being understanding. THAT is being open minded. THAT is being a person who knows others have opinions (i have a special place in my heart for these people btw).Anyhow, i hope that y'all can give it a fucking break. Not everyone has to love something that you love or have a high opinion of. If you don't like my review then move over.OG Review:Aaah. To hate a series everyone loves ... feels bad dude. I have been known to have unpopular opinions in the past and my friends just tell me to \"lower my expectations\" but please answer me :If a book has an average of 4.45 rating, If that book is in the 'favorites' shelf of almost all of your friends, If that book is going to be developed into a TV show, If you open a user on goodreads and they have their username including the words \"Kaz\" and \"Brekker\", If they have mentioned in their about section that they will only befriend you 'if' you 'love' this book, If it takes you nearly five minutes to find a one star review of a book ...

            "Translation failed for: LET ME EXPLAIN, GUYS.Okay. I like Marquez. I think his writing is beautiful, his settings are evocative and masterfully portrayed, and yes, his books are pretty romantic, and I always enjoy magical realism (this one could have used more of that last bit, though). The last twenty pages of the book even manged to suck me into the romance of the story, and I found myself finally really invested in this love story instead of being vaguely creeped out (we'll get there). Look, I even found a really nice passage to quote:\"It was as if they had leapt over the arduous calvary of conjugal life and gone straight to the heart of love. They were together in silence like an old married couple wary of life, beyond the pitfalls of passion, beyond the brutal mockery of hope and the phantoms of disillusion: beyond love. For they had lived together long enough to know that love was always love, anytime and anyplace, but it was more solid the closer it came to death.\"See? That's fucking beautiful, and even if I didn't like the story itself, I still liked the writing. So call off the dogs, Marquez apologists, and let's get to the ranting portion of the review.Fair warning to all who proceed past this point: I am preparing to don my Feminist Rage hat and shout about rape culture. Those who plan to leave mean comments calling me an idiot or telling me that I misunderstood the book, remember that you were warned. BEWARE, FOR HERE BE DRAGONS AND ANGRY FEMINISTS.Here's something I learned about myself while reading this: I have absolutely no patience for books about obsession disguised as love. I hated it inTwilight, I hated it inWuthering Heights, I hated it inThe Phantom of the Opera, and I hated it here. It would be one thing, I decided, if Fermina Daza felt as passionately about Florentino Ariza as he felt about her.But she didn't love him. For her, their romance was a brief fling in her teens, and she stopped loving him when she returned from her trip. She continued not loving him, until he wears her down (after writing her letters constantly despite her explicitly telling him to fuck off out of her life) and she basically shrugs her shoulders and says, fine, might as well.The lesson men can take from this book is that if a woman says \"no\" (as Fermina frequently and clearly says to Florentino), she really means, \"make me change my mind.\" NOPE. NOPE NOPE NOPE. THIS PHILOSOPHY IS NOT OKAY AND IT IS WHY RAPE CULTURE EXISTS. NO MEANS FUCKING NO, EVERYBODY. IF A WOMAN TELLS YOU TO LEAVE HER ALONE, YOU LEAVE HER THE FUCK ALONE. IT IS NOT ROMANTIC TO OBSESS ABOUT HER FOR FIFTY YEARS, IT IS CREEPY.And OF COURSE Florentino still fucks anything that moves while claiming to be in love with Fermina, because he is a man and that's just how it works. Which leads me to my next ranting point: this book romanticizes rape.(you can still get out, guys - it's only going to get worse from here)First there was the intensely unsettling way Florentino loses his virginity: while traveling on a ship, a woman drags him into her cabin and forces him to have sex with her. Then Florentino falls in love with her. Because of course he does. I was willing to chalk this scene up to the common misconception that men cannot be sexually assaulted because men are horny dogs who are always up for sex no matter what - fine, whatever, I'll let it go. But then later, a minor female character describes the time she got raped, and I'm going to let you guys read this while I do yoga breaths in the corner and count to ten slowly:\"When she was still very young, a strong, able man whose face she never saw took her by surprise, threw her down on the jetty, ripped her clothes off, and made instantaneous and frenetic love to her. Lying there on the rocks, her body covered with cuts and bruises, she had wanted that man to stay forever so she could die of love in his arms.\"...Once more with feeling: NOPE.AND THEN, as the creepy pedophilic cherry on top of this rape sundae, Florentino's last affair is with a child. When he is in his sixties. The best part is that he doesn't even use the classic pedophile's defense of \"yes, she's young, but she ACTS like a grown woman!\" No, Florentino sees that this child is going to be smoking hot when she grows up, and decides that he can't wait that long. Then this passage happens:\"She was still a child in every sense of the word, with braces on her teeth and the scrapes of elementary school on her knees, but he saw right away the kind of woman she was soon going to be, and he cultivated her during a slow year of Saturdays at the circus, Sundays in the park with ice cream, childish late afternoons, and he won her confidence, he won her affection, he led her by the hand, with the gentle astuteness of a kind grandfather, toward his secret slaughterhouse.\"The hero ofLove in the Time of Cholera, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a round of applause.If anyone wants to join me in the corner, I will be staying here for the rest of the week., error: DAJCIE MI WYJAŚNIĆ, LUDZIE. Okej. Lubię Marqueza. Uważam, że jego styl pisania jest piękny, sceneria jest sugestywna i mistrzowsko przedstawiona, i tak, jego książki są dość romantyczne, a ja zawsze lubię magiczny realizm (choć ta mogłaby mieć więcej tego ostatniego fragmentu). Ostatnie dwadzieścia stron książki wciągnęło mnie w romans historii i w końcu naprawdę zaangażowałem się w tę historię miłosną, zamiast czuć się niejasno przerażonym (do tego dojdziemy). Spójrzcie, znalazłem nawet naprawdę miły fragment do zacytowania: „To było tak, jakby przeskoczyli przez trudną kalwarię życia małżeńskiego i trafili prosto do serca miłości. Byli razem w ciszy jak stare małżeństwo obawiające się życia, poza pułapkami namiętności, poza brutalną kpiną z nadziei i widmami rozczarowania: poza miłością. Bo żyli razem wystarczająco długo, aby wiedzieć, że miłość zawsze była miłością, zawsze i wszędzie, ale stawała się tym trwalsza, im bliżej była śmierci”. Widzicie? To jest cholernie piękne, i nawet jeśli nie podobała mi się sama historia, to i tak podobał mi się styl pisania. Więc odwołajcie psy, apologeci Marqueza, i przejdźmy do części recenzji, w której się wyżywam. Uczciwe ostrzeżenie dla wszystkich, którzy przejdą dalej: przygotowuję się do założenia czapki Feminist Rage i krzyczenia o kulturze gwałtu. Ci, którzy planują zostawić złośliwe komentarze, nazywając mnie idiotą lub mówiąc mi, że źle zrozumiałam książkę, pamiętajcie, że zostaliście ostrzeżeni. UWAGA, BO TU SĄ SMOKI I WŚCIEKŁE FEMINISTKI. Oto coś, czego dowiedziałam się o sobie podczas czytania: nie mam absolutnie żadnej cierpliwości do książek o obsesji przebranej za miłość. Nienawidziłam tego w Zmierzchu, nienawidziłam tego w Wichrowych wzgórzach, nienawidziłam tego w Upiorze w operze i nienawidziłam tego tutaj. To byłoby jedno, zdecydowałam, gdyby Fermina Daza czuła do Florentina Arizy tak namiętnie, jak on do niej. Ale ona go nie kochała. Dla niej ich romans był krótkim romansem w okresie dorastania, a ona przestała go kochać, gdy wróciła z podróży. Nadal go nie kochała, dopóki jej nie wyczerpał (po ciągłym pisaniu do niej listów, mimo że wyraźnie mu kazała się odpieprzyć z jej życia), a ona po prostu wzruszyła ramionami i powiedziała, dobra, równie dobrze. Lekcja, jaką mężczyźni mogą wyciągnąć z tej książki, jest taka, że ​​jeśli kobieta mówi „nie” (jak Fermina często i wyraźnie mówi Florentino), tak naprawdę ma na myśli „zmuś mnie do zmiany zdania”. NIE. NIE, NIE, NIE. TA FILOZOFIA NIE JEST OK I DLATEGO ISTNIEJE KULTURA GWAŁTU. NIE ZNACZY KURWA NIE, WSZYSCY. JEŚLI KOBIETA POWIE CI, ŻEBYŚ ZOSTAWIŁ JĄ W SPOKOJU, ZOSTAWIŁEŚ JĄ W SPOKOJU. NIE JEST ROMANTYCZNE BYCIE OBSESJONALNYM PRZEZ PIĘĆDZIESIĄT LAT NA JEJ TEMAT, JEST TO PRZERAŻAJĄCE. I OCZYWIŚCIE Florentino nadal rucha wszystko, co się rusza, twierdząc, że jest zakochany w Ferminie, ponieważ jest mężczyzną i tak to po prostu działa. Co prowadzi mnie do kolejnego punktu mojego wywodu: ta książka romantyzuje gwałt. (nadal możecie się wydostać, chłopaki - od tego momentu będzie tylko gorzej) Najpierw był niezwykle niepokojący sposób, w jaki Florentino traci dziewictwo: podczas podróży statkiem kobieta wciąga go do swojej kabiny i zmusza do seksu z nią. Potem Florentino się w niej zakochuje. Bo oczywiście, że tak. Byłem skłonny zrzucić tę scenę na karb powszechnego błędnego przekonania, że ​​mężczyzn nie można molestować seksualnie, ponieważ mężczyźni to napalone psy, które zawsze są chętne na seks, bez względu na wszystko - dobra, nieważne, odpuszczę to. Ale później, drugoplanowa postać kobieca opisuje czas, kiedy została zgwałcona, a ja pozwolę wam to przeczytać, podczas gdy ja będę w kącie wykonywać ćwiczenia oddechowe jogi i powoli liczyć do dziesięciu: „Kiedy była jeszcze bardzo młoda, silny, sprawny mężczyzna, którego twarzy nigdy nie widziała, zaskoczył ją, rzucił na molo, zdarł z niej ubranie i uprawiał z nią natychmiastowy i gorączkowy seks. Leżąc tam na skałach, z ciałem pokrytym ranami i siniakami, chciała, żeby ten mężczyzna został z nią na zawsze, żeby mogła umrzeć z miłości w jego ramionach”.... Po raz kolejny z uczuciem: NIE. A POTEM, jako przerażająca pedofilska wisienka na torcie tego gwałtu, ostatni romans Florentino ma z dzieckiem. Kiedy ma sześćdziesiąt lat. Najlepsze jest to, że nawet nie używa klasycznej obrony pedofila: „tak, jest młoda, ale ZACHOWUJE SIĘ jak dorosła kobieta!” Nie, Florentino widzi, że ta dziewczynka będzie gorąca, kiedy dorośnie, i postanawia, że ​​nie może czekać tak długo. Wtedy następuje ten fragment: „Była jeszcze dzieckiem w każdym tego słowa znaczeniu, z aparatem ortodontycznym na zębach i zadrapaniami szkoły podstawowej na kolanach, ale on od razu zobaczył, jaką kobietą wkrótce się stanie, i pielęgnował ją podczas spokojnego roku sobót w cyrku, niedziel w parku z lodami, dziecięcych późnych popołudni, i zdobył jej zaufanie, zdobył jej uczucie, poprowadził ją za rękę, z delikatną przenikliwością miłego dziadka, w stronę swojej tajnej rzeźni”. Bohater Miłości w czasach zarazy, panie i panowie. Dajmy mu owacje na stojąco. Jeśli ktoś chce dołączyć do mnie w kącie, zostanę tutaj do końca tygodnia. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: I want to give a big old round of applause to HarperTEEN and their insane marketing campaign. Bravo. That is not mockery, but a legit salute. I sincerely have to give it up to you for convincing me that Ihadto own this book. I was caught up and boarded the Twitter hypetrainas it drove me round and round the blogosphere'sFactions. (BTW, I still don't know who drives the damn train.) So, by the time I stepped into my local bookstore and laid eyes onInsurgentI happily handed over my $17.99. I wasn't thinkinglogically. It was as if I was under asimulation. (HAHAHA! Did you see what Ididthere?)And that ending? Ugh. I... I... I need a moment. Let me just stop myself right here before I end up writing areallynegative review and 1 starring one of the most anticipated books of 2012.But know I am displeased. VERY. Just look at how long it took me to finish the book!-----------------------------------------------What a shame. The most anticipated book of 2012 is my most disappointing read so far. After all the positive reviews I read, I knew for sure I'd love it. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way. I was conflicted on whether to give this book one or two stars. In the end,Insurgent'ssaving grace is that it simply doesn't belong with some of my other one starred books. So,I feel I must warn whoever stumbles across this review: If this is one of your favorite series and you love it with the burning passion of a supernova, this review might have the potential to piss you off. It might be best for both you and I if you just hit the back button now before things get going.Go on. Spock and I will wait.*whistles*Oh, you're staying, huh? Well, strap yourself in because I have a feeling it might just be one ofthosereviews...Spock tells me this review must contain mild spoilers in order to logically explain this illogical novel. Sorry, kids. Spock's call.The first big negative right off the bat was thatInsurgentpicks up directly afterDivergentleft off. There is virtually no recap to the story or characters and if you read the book a year ago, well, you may be screwed. But thankfully,Roth wrote up a lovely little cheat sheetfor just this purpose. Yay! However, the problem doesn't just lie with remembering names. It lies with the connection the reader may or may not have had with the characters inDivergent, which was now non-existent since I could barely remember who was who. What's that you say? So and so just got shot in the head? I'm sorry, I can't find a single fuck to give. Then, we are introduced to even more characters. So, not only do I have to attempt to remember the old characters, but I have to keep track of these newbies too? That's just way too much work. Obviously, this isn't reallyInsurgent'sfault, but I thought it would helpful to point this out.The Plot:What happened here? What happened to the action packed dystopian series I was introduced to inDivergent? Where the hell was Tris and why was Bella playing her role? Why did Four suddenly update his Facebook status to Douche Bag? Who's idea was it to turnInsurgentinto a DystopianRomance?One thing I loved aboutDivergentwas that the romance took a back seat to the story and action. But inInsurgentthe action is scattered with a heavier focus on Tris and Four's relationship. Look, that is not what I signed up for. I really don't care if Four loves Tris or if they'll end up riding a unicorn that poops rainbows as they ride off into the sunset. Whatever, whatever, whatever.So, the Erudite are trying to take over their world by creating a new serum for those that are Divergent while the Factionless plan a rebellion. But all that usually happens in the background with occasional mention to keep the reader up to date. Most of the novel we are stuck in Tris' head as she goes into angst mode over Four, her parents and Will. It was so boring I felt like I was stuck in a throwback episode ofAs the World Turns.On repeat. Save me. But wait! We have a random plot twist at the end right before the battle is about to go down. Marcus (Four's abusive father) decides to enlist Tris to help him retrieve information stolen from Abnegation. He tells her it's super secret and that he can't tell her what it is because it's something you have to see, that she'll just have to trust him. Doing so would betray Four. She agrees.Wait. Pause.Tris hates Marcus. Tris loves Four. Tris doesn't know what information they would be retrieving. She also doesn't know if Marcus is telling her the truth. She has absolutely no reason to believe him. No real evidence to back up his claim. She agrees. Without much thought. Tris is supposed to have an aptitude for Erudite, right? She's supposed to be logical, RIGHT?!Tris, pack your bags. I think Spock has just voted you off the island.That makes no sense! And then when I found out the super big secret, guess what? He could have easily told her! I smell and easy plot cop-out, folks. The secret is kept long enough from the reader just so it can push you off the cliff on the last page.World Building:InDivergentI let a lot slide and roll off me because I was entertained throughout the entire book. I'm known to do that with a lot of books likeWitherandAcross the Universe, for example. I could not do it withInsurgent. You see, I have the attention span of a fruit fly. If I'm not fully engaged in the book, I'm going to notice things. Things I probably wouldn't care too much about if I were enjoying myself. Like how the Erudite wear glasses just because they're smart. Or how even though Tris is emotionally unbalanced 16-year-old, everyone still looks to her to \"analyze the situation.\" Or even how impossible I find these factions. How is it that you can put all of these traits into neat little boxes and ask a person to choose one over the others? This is the same problem I had withThe Hunt. In both novels the author tries to pitch an idea of human behavior completely different from what reality is, but you can clearly see the flaws with it. However, the main character fully believes in that world and way of thinking. They try to rationalize it, convince you of it. Yes, I realize it's a Dystopian novel, but this is a hard concept to sell because it makes it difficult for me to sympathize with the main character, their conflicted feelings and understand their world. Believability is key for me and I have a hard time believing this world. Tris frequently switches back and forth between her Dauntless, Erudite and Abnegation sides. Other characters comment on her embracing one trait depending on what the situation calls for it. But this doesn't work for me. Real talk, you can't just put logical thinking back in the toy chest when you decide you don't want to play with it anymore. It doesn't work like that. At least... I don't think so. Spock?I'm getting no-ish vibes.Tris:This series gets a lot of comparisons toThe Hunger Gamesand in a way I can see why. You have your young girl who, one way or another, plays an important part in bringing forth change to her society. And if I really had to compare the two, I'd say thatInsurgentis likeMockingjay. Tris is depressed, struggling to hold it together and fight in the war. The difference comes into play when Tris borderline gives up, while Katniss kicked ass until the very end. I'm not saying Tris didn't have the right to be depressed because I do believe she did. But it was really over done for me. I felt like I was drowning in her angst. This book is over 500 pages long and most of the action doesn't even show up to the party until the last 30 pages! So what was Tris doing for the other 500 pages?Not a damn thing.No, scratch that. Spock tells me that is inaccurate. Tris was in fact doing something. She was off being selfless, trying to get herself killed so that no one else would die.Bella is that you? I didn't know you did Dystopias now!That irritated me to no end. At one point she turns herself into the Erudite because they threatened to kill off people until Divergent started surrendering. So, of course, Tris thinks it has to be her and sneaks off to give herself up before the Dauntless can form a plan. Now, let's think about thislogically. Tris knows the Erudite want to experiment on her for a Divergent-proof serum. Which means more people would be enslaved and/or killedbecauseof her turning herself in. *facepalm* Then she almost dies, but it was too late because I had run out of fucks by then! So I had to shake Spock down for some.What do you mean you're out of fucks?! One of us has to care if Tris lives or dies!The Ending:Okay, lots of spoilers here, folks. Spoilers all around from this point on.I didn't like the ending. I felt cheated because I had hung on for the ending. Everyone said how it made up for the rest of the book and what not, but here's the thing: The ending couldn't make up for all the angst-filled fluff the rest of the book was stuffed with. I didn't feel the anticipation throughout the novel and I hate to admit that I was really tempted to skim. The villan was killed really fast without much of a fight. I always hate when that happens. The villan has been giving the characters hell all throughout the story and by the time their number is up, they beg for their life and die by a simple stab wound?\"Yes, if you kill me you'll never find the information!\"*stabby stab*>insert blood and stuff<\"UGH! I'M MELTING!\"*dies*Still no fucks I see. That's cold, bro.And the big secret wasn't anything you couldn't have guessed fromDivergent. It's revealed that the world is in chaos outside of the fence. Murders, destruction, etc. The weird thing is that I actually forgot about their society being enclosed in the fence until it was brought up near the end. It totally slipped my mind. But, I digress. The entire point of their society was to be a fresh start to the world. Somehow by boxing people in these Factions and waiting for the Divergent to emerge that equates to saving humanity. I'm not exactly sure how that works since the book just ends with that revelation and the Acknowledgements rolled. But I feel like Roth wrote herself all the way to a deserted island, sent up her S.O.S. signal and that cliffhanger fell right out of the sky to the rescue. *sigh* I really hate cliffhangers. It was one of the things that I liked aboutDivergent. For the most part things were tied up, but with Insurgent? It's quite the mess we'll be walking into in book three.Will I read the next book? Yes, because I've come this far and I'm hoping I will enjoy book three as much as I enjoyedDivergent. I thinkInsurgentsuffers from \"Second Book Syndrome\" and the infamous \"Hype Train,\" may it die in a fire (the Hype Train, not the book). But ultimately, I'm interested in how Roth will explain away everything. Maybe then this whole series will make perfect logical sense to me. Until then, drink time, Spock?More reviews and shenanigans atCuddlebuggery Book Blog., error: I want to give a big old round of applause to HarperTEEN and their insane marketing campaign. Bravo.

            "Translation failed for: Uh-oh. Why did I break my promise to myself and read this book?Was it my curiosity? Well, I need to be more careful.After all, curiosity killed the cat - and I'm a Leo.Uh-oh.Now I'm afraid that this book may have made me use up a few of my allotted nine lives. O_OWelcome back to the senseless world of dystopian Chicagowhere you are only allowed to have one personality trait, which apparently is determined in what seems to be an equivalent of a 5-question multiple choice test. And this ridiculousness is presented very seriously. Let's catch up, shall we?If you happen to give your seat on a bus to an old lady - well, you must be selfless! Welcome toAbnegationwhere you can enjoy shapeless clothes and bland food.If you have ever wondered how stuff works and dared to ask a smart question - welcome to theEEEEvil Educated Erudites Exclusive Establishment! A set of complementary spectacles and a seat at the library are waiting for you!You frown upon lying?Welcome to candid life of Candor. Enjoy your lie detector tests! Now there's only one answer you can give to the eternal question,\"Does this make me look fat?\"(and punched in the face you will be, no doubt.)You are a tree-hugging (or people hugging) hippie?Amity, 'nuff said.You are a near-suicidal borderline sociopath who loves jumping off moving trains and beat the crap out of people??? Heh-heh.You must beBrainlessDauntless. Enjoy your youth because you'll die young and in true Darwin Awards fashion.But what if you happen to be a normal person with more than one personality trait?What if you are a tree-hugging gardening-loving hippie who helps old ladies cross the street while being able to truthfully recite 34 decimal digits of pi??????HIGH ALERT!!!! YOU ARE DIVERGENT!!! THE HORROR!!! YOU ARE SOMEHOW SPECIAL!!! DANGER TO THE SOCIETY!!! RUN AND HIDE!!!!This how we left things inDivergentthat for all its flaws was quite entertaining. Now we're moving on toInsurgentwhere ridiculous overpowers the fun amidst nothing happening.We start with our lovely heroine Tris, recently tortured and shot in the shoulder after which she lost quite a bit of blood - right away easily jumping off trains and running around like the invincible little special snowflake she is.When she's not defying basic laws of human physiology, she moons over her boyfriend Tobias, and tries to pull the traditional YA self-sacrificing for the sake of the loved one cliché.Peripheral characters die left and right in this book - but Tris is not even slowed down by serious physical injuries. It's like she's Superman's long lost cousin.And how exactly is she so badass? Is it her 'extensive' Dauntless training? I beg to differ.After a few weeks of haphazard training in the Dauntless compound -the training that appeared to consist of teenagers pummeling each other into pulp, shooting guns and throwing knives without any real instructions, jumping from moving trains, and never actually having time to recover from physical injuries, and playing 'Capture the Flag'- Tris is, of course, a highly trained physical menace.If that's what makes you so super-fit in this dystopian world, the rest of them must be so deconditioned they fall over from just walking.Dauntless training:Left:what we are expected to believe it is.Right:what it probably looked like the entire time.Seriously, all the training happened in the previous book. This one really presents Tris as an accomplished badass - again, after a month or so of physical training. Really, book?-------Tobias, apparently less than impressed with Tris's special snowflake-ness, spends the majority of this book pouting at her, yelling at her, being bossy, patronizing, dismissive, and full of double standards. In the meantime, Tris spends quite a bit of time swooning over him,while Nataliya spends quite a bit of time perfecting the eye-rolling exercises(my version of Dauntless workouts, using eye muscles only).-------And here's the worst thing - in many many many many pages of this book not much of significance ever happens. Seriously.The rest of the story (the parts not about Tobias and Tris' relationship) consists of contrived yet repetitive situations in this ridiculously constructed world that is completely unsustainable the way it's presented that read like a 12-year-old wrote them. Go to a new compound, meet stupid and selfish/evil/plotting/weak leaders, engage in a confrontation with the Erudites, meet those prejudiced against you, watch a peripheral character die, do something noble, do something reckless, do something selfless, rinse, repeat, pass 'Go', collect some angst points.Most side characters are so under-developed and one-sidedthat the idea of the world where people are okay with being defined only by a single quality almost begins to make sense - except I think it's less deliberate planning than poor characterization. Add to this the fact that not much actually happens in this book to meaningfully advance the plot in any way - and you see how this can getjuuuuusta bit frustrating.And the much-talked-about ending? I found it (a) ridiculous and (b) quite predictable- I called it not that far into the book, thinking about the only possible way a world so illogical as this one would ever come into being(and, in all honesty, I watched enough of M. Night Shyamalan's films to jump to the conclusion that is the Big Reveal. Call me nerdy? Well, yeah).Hey, but at least we get a mention of prefrontal cortex and mirror neurons in the context of pseudo-science of the Erudites here.Neuroscience Made Ridiculously Simple, huh?If things like that are what makes the Erudite seem smart, this world is screwed.By the way: What did smart people ever do to Veronica Roth?Erudite = Evilgets annoying rather quickly. Why is it that it's the \"brave\" who are awesome - and all the other qualities appear vastly inferior?

Why did I break my promise to myself and read this book?Was it my curiosity? Well, I need to be more careful.After all, curiosity killed the cat - and I'm a Leo.Uh-oh.Now I'm afraid that this book may have made me use up a few of my allotted nine lives. O_OWelcome back to the senseless world of dystopian Chicagowhere you are only allowed to have one personality trait, which apparently is determined in what seems to be an equivalent of a 5-question multiple choice test. And this ridiculousness is presented very seriously. Let's catch up, shall we?If you happen to give your seat on a bus to an old lady - well, you must be selfless! Welcome toAbnegationwhere you can enjoy shapeless clothes and bland food.If you have ever wondered how stuff works and dared to ask a smart question - welcome to theEEEEvil Educated Erudites Exclusive Establishment! A set of complementary spectacles and a seat at the library are waiting for you!You frown upon lying?Welcome to candid life of Candor. Enjoy your lie detector tests! Now there's only one answer you can give to the eternal question,\"Does this make me look fat?\"(and punched in the face you will be, no doubt.)You are a tree-hugging (or people hugging) hippie?Amity, 'nuff said.You are a near-suicidal borderline sociopath who loves jumping off moving trains and beat the crap out of people??? Heh-heh.You must beBrainlessDauntless. Enjoy your youth because you'll die young and in true Darwin Awards fashion.But what if you happen to be a normal person with more than one personality trait?What if you are a tree-hugging gardening-loving hippie who helps old ladies cross the street while being able to truthfully recite 34 decimal digits of pi??????HIGH ALERT!!!! YOU ARE DIVERGENT!!! THE HORROR!!! YOU ARE SOMEHOW SPECIAL!!! DANGER TO THE SOCIETY!!! RUN AND HIDE!!!!This how we left things inDivergentthat for all its flaws was quite entertaining. Now we're moving on toInsurgentwhere ridiculous overpowers the fun amidst nothing happening.We start with our lovely heroine Tris, recently tortured and shot in the shoulder after which she lost quite a bit of blood - right away easily jumping off trains and running around like the invincible little special snowflake she is.When she's not defying basic laws of human physiology, she moons over her boyfriend Tobias, and tries to pull the traditional YA self-sacrificing for the sake of the loved one cliché.Peripheral characters die left and right in this book - but Tris is not even slowed down by serious physical injuries. It's like she's Superman's long lost cousin.And how exactly is she so badass? Is it her 'extensive' Dauntless training? I beg to differ.After a few weeks of haphazard training in the Dauntless compound -the training that appeared to consist of teenagers pummeling each other into pulp, shooting guns and throwing knives without any real instructions, jumping from moving trains, and never actually having time to recover from physical injuries, and playing 'Capture the Flag'- Tris is, of course, a highly trained physical menace.If that's what makes you so super-fit in this dystopian world, the rest of them must be so deconditioned they fall over from just walking.Dauntless training:Left:what we are expected to believe it is.Right:what it probably looked like the entire time.Seriously, all the training happened in the previous book. This one really presents Tris as an accomplished badass - again, after a month or so of physical training. Really, book?-------Tobias, apparently less than impressed with Tris's special snowflake-ness, spends the majority of this book pouting at her, yelling at her, being bossy, patronizing, dismissive, and full of double standards. In the meantime, Tris spends quite a bit of time swooning over him,while Nataliya spends quite a bit of time perfecting the eye-rolling exercises(my version of Dauntless workouts, using eye muscles only).-------And here's the worst thing - in many many many many pages of this book not much of significance ever happens. Seriously.The rest of the story (the parts not about Tobias and Tris' relationship) consists of contrived yet repetitive situations in this ridiculously constructed world that is completely unsustainable the way it's presented that read like a 12-year-old wrote them. Go to a new compound, meet stupid and selfish/evil/plotting/weak leaders, engage in a confrontation with the Erudites, meet those prejudiced against you, watch a peripheral character die, do something noble, do something reckless, do something selfless, rinse, repeat, pass 'Go', collect some angst points.Most side characters are so under-developed and one-sidedthat the idea of the world where people are okay with being defined only by a single quality almost begins to make sense - except I think it's less deliberate planning than poor characterization. Add to this the fact that not much actually happens in this book to meaningfully advance the plot in any way - and you see how this can getjuuuuusta bit frustrating.And the much-talked-about ending? I found it (a) ridiculous and (b) quite predictable- I called it not that far into the book, thinking about the only possible way a world so illogical as this one would ever come into being(and, in all honesty, I watched enough of M. Night Shyamalan's films to jump to the conclusion that is the Big Reveal. Call me nerdy? Well, yeah).Hey, but at least we get a mention of prefrontal cortex and mirror neurons in the context of pseudo-science of the Erudites here.Neuroscience Made Ridiculously Simple, huh?If things like that are what makes the Erudite seem smart, this world is screwed.By the way: What did smart people ever do to Veronica Roth?Erudite = Evilgets annoying rather quickly. Why is it that it's the \"brave\" who are awesome - and all the other qualities appear vastly inferior? Is it because Gryffindor in Harry Potter (another universe that sorted kids by their one defining character trait) housed the brave? Is it because bespectacled kids (the stereotypical 'smart') seem like easy targets on the playground?C'mon, Veronica Roth, smart kids are cool, oh-kay?Cool smart people.

It'll twist your brain around and leave you thinking up is down and right is wrong.”Well, isn’t that the truth?The Battle of Labyrinthis, so far, the most disappointed installment for this series, and very much less exciting than the previous books.As much as I hate to say it, the ship of Percabeth is drowning in this installment instead of sailing.One reason I can’t get behind the Percabeth ship here is because of Annabeth’s continuous but hidden feelings for Luke. Say what you want to say, but she doesn’t shut up about him. You expect me to believe Percabeth is a thing when she’s jealous over Rachel and Percy’s friendshipyetshe clearly isn’t over Luke? I don’t think so. It doesn’t even matter if they aren’t romantic feelings anymore. Even Thalia was able to tell Luke was long gone and gave up on him rather quickly. I liked her attitude on that, because she knew she wasn’t responsible for “saving” someone who didn’t even want it. If Luke was written differently, in a way where we, as the readers, could see he wants help, or has hope to leave the Titan’s and Kronos, I would accept Annabeth’s concern over him. However, even if I don’t hate Luke (shoutout to Rick for that), I cannot bring myself to sympathize with her either. While the previous book showed the future potential for these two, this one officially killed it.While I love Annabeth in the first three books, she frustrated me a lot here. She came across more rude, unwilling to think about how others feel. I despised her attitude towards Rachel, even if I can understand where she was coming from. Some may argue it’s because she was jealous of Rachel and Percy, and while this makes sense, I can’t move on from it due to the reality of how Percy feels.As readers, it’s obvious to see Annabeth has feelings for Percy, but as an outsider’s perspective, if we take Percy into consideration and how he feels, he clearly hasn’t noticed. Honestly, I believe even Percy doesn’t know who he likes and how he feels. He’s shownsomethingfor others like Calypso, and he’s not exactly distancing himself from Rachel, but he doesn’t make himself stand out. He’s a high school freshman now, but as Rachel said, he’s a dude, and he’s blind. Still, in my opinion, he doesn’t give any signals about how he feels, only small things we can interpret. Therefore, Annabeth’s jealousy towards Rachel felt unprovoked, unnecessary and for no good measure. I wanna say it’s childish, but since they are kids, I guess it makes sense. Regardless, I would appreciate this future couple more had Annabeth not been so mixed with her feelings, with her obvious attraction to Percy becoming more obvious but her care and defense for Luke still overcoming it. I’m not reading this series for this couple, especially as it’s still a middle grade novel (though I’d argue it’s more YA now with the kids being in high school), so the romance is not the biggest point here. Still, when everyone who loves this series mentions the two of them together, I would have expected to be feeling the same. Sadly, I couldn’t bring myself to root for them, for their future stories and moments, when Annabeth’s attitude feels rash, completely thoughtless.“What is it with you?” I snapped. “Why do you keep defending him?”Dear Percy, I wanna know that too.Plus, Annabeth’s personality here felt so different than the previous books. Whereas before I thought she was incredibly strong, adventurous, and courageous, here she felt not only rude, but also obnoxious. For as strong as she was before, now her diligence was just concealed. She just feels whiny now, complaining about Luke, and defending Luke all the time. They share a past and history together, so it’s easy to understand how and why Annabeth feels protective over Luke. Regardless, there’s no character development or any type of hint showing character development. There’s no implication that Annabeth is growing from her previous feelings, whether romantic, platonic, or admirable. This will all come down to how one interprets Annabeth’s feelings. Some may see it as her still seeing Luke as her hero, while others, like me, will still see it as something more. Regardless, even if I saw Annabeth as seeing Luke as someone she still looks up to, I still don’t think there has been any character development on her end. I would believe it more had she shown any type of remorse for how shehasbeen feeling. In my opinion, it felt like her entire arc revolves around stating Luke is being manipulated, Luke this, Luke that.So much for being the wise girl, huh? After four books, this is simply disappointing.Also, I feel as if this was the book with the least fitting title. I mean, we still learn about the Labyrinth, but I guess what I’m trying to say is that I expected MORE of thebattleof Labyrinth. I’ve been really excited to see how Percy becomes stronger throughout the books. We don’t really see him training and improving, so it’s safe to say it happens outside the book, which means we don’t read about it all the time. Because of this happening off-page, I have been looking forward to seeing Percy fight more, grow stronger, and show us his potential more. I do think the author’s timeline is working out perfectly well. I don’t think it’s progressing too slow or too fast, and the development of everything happening feels right. Yet, I can’t help but be disappointed with the lack of…powers? Magic? We see more of Percy’s potential here, which is super exciting to finally see, and something we can say we have been waiting for. On the other hand, it has been three years since we met Percy and he joined the camp, yet not much new has happened in regards to who he is, his potential, and what he can do. This had the most fighting and action of the series thus far. While it was nice, it wasn’t the most exciting. I would have expected more resolution to be done. At this point, I can only say there are scenes that feel repetitive concerning who he is as a half-blood.I also thought the entire execution of Pan was underwhelming, as if the entire journey of finding him was not as important. I was happy for Grover, and then I was disappointed. I think it’s fair to say I was expecting a better execution, more performance to show its relevance. This also had some similarity to book 2,The Sea of Monsters, where, once again, the characters felt off in who they are. I can confidently sayThe Sea of Monstersstill provided that laughter and humor this series was looking promising to have. This fourth installment was simply so dull compared to its predecessors. Even with all the fights, action, twists and turns, disappointment makes me too bitter.With that being said, I still think there are praise worthy moments in this book. I’ve loved seeing the new gods we meet through the story, both good and bad, and how they have relevance to Percy and his journey. I’ve loved seeing how Percy becomes more acquainted with those closest to him as well. Grover, though, has shown fantastic character development. I’m looking forward to seeing how his powers evolve. I especially loved that we got more of Tyson here and how he became an important part of Percy’s gang. Seeing him tag along made the journey all the better. Special shoutout to Mrs. O’Leary. I always have a soft spot for animal characters in books, and Mrs. O’Leary being a huge hellhound makes no difference. I’m glad Quintus left her with Percy instead of getting rid of her. It warms my heart knowing she is in good hands. Dionysus, God of Wine, has greatly grown on me. He’s unintentionally hilarious. I wish he had more page-time because his banter created some of that humor and joy missing. I also loved Calypso, even though I feel so bad for her. And of course, Nico, my precious, misunderstood emo baby. I am so excited to learn more about him throughout the series.As mentioned before, I do think the author has written the stories progression really well, timeline wise. The way everything is happening, from the Titan’s army forming and attacking, to how Kronos is being reformed, to how Percy and everyone else are gathering allies and continue learning more about the prophecy; it all comes into a well-done conclusion. Once again, I am a fan of this author’s writing. The way he writes in vivid detail, explaining the monsters and gods is very imaginary. It’s easy to see the descriptions come to life. And even though I was disappointed with Percy’s character arc, I do like seeing more action being done here.

            "Translation failed for: This review has been a long time coming. I readThe Three Musketeerslast year in August. Back then, I had high expectations for the book because a couple of months prior, Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo had become one of my favorite novels of all time and I couldn’t wait to check out more by this brilliant writer. Unfortunately,The Three Musketeerswas a huge disappointment. Sure, there were some funny scenes and captivating moments but all in all, I was truly shocked by how unlikeable (and highly problematic!) our four main protagonists were.D’Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis are absolute shit-heads; so much so that I simply couldn’t root for them at all. But before we get into it, let’s set the scene and remind ourselves whatThe Three Musketeersis actually about: It is the year of our Lord 1625. D'Artagnan, a young nobleman from Gascony, has just arrived in Paris to become a King's musketeer. There he meets Athos, Porthos and Aramis, as well as the Queen's beautiful maid, Constance.Soon he is involved in an intrigue that involves the fate of all of France. Cardinal Richelieu, prime minister of King Louis XIII, is doing everything he can to discredit the Queen in order to further expand his own power in the Kingdom. Heeding his advice, the King is giving a grand ball at which the Queen is to wear the King's gift: a magnificent piece of jewellery with diamond studs. Unfortunately, however, she had given these jewels to her lover, the English prime minister Lord Buckingham.The affair is highly explosive, all the more so because relations between the two countries are very tense. England supports the Protestant rebels of La Rochelle, which is besieged by Louis XIII in a long and gruelling campaign. With the honor of a lady and the stability of the Kingdom at stake, our musketeers decide to intervene. However, the scheming Cardinal has a trump card: his agent, the diabolical Milady de Winter, who will do anything to derail their mission.So far, so good. It sounds like a conventional adventure tale that is bound to have you on the edge of your seat and rooting for the musketeers to preserve the Queen’s honor. Well, it didn’t turn out this way. When actually reading the book, it becomes crystal clear that our supposed heroes—Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan—are actually cruel and criminal. All they do is drink, steal, swindle, or seduce people of lower social classes. Their behaviour is absolutely appalling and disgusting. They even kill other members of their nation’s legitimate military and peacekeeping forces for petty reasons.And to top it all of, D’Artagnan, who is supposed to be our lovely and ambitious country boy, rapes Milady. Yes, you read that right. He actually rapes her. What makes this even more iffy is the fact that most translations of Dumas’ classic have glossed over and altered this scene. However, when you look at the source material it becomes clear that d’Artagnan (in that one fateful scene) pretended to be Milady’s lover, the Count de Wardes, to coerce her into sleeping with him. [If you’re interested in this particular aspect of the story I can only recommend the Richard Pevear translation, as it is the only English translation that is truthful to the source material.]So, yeah, our “heroes”, the people we are supposed to be rooting for, are actually deeply horrible and, quite frankly, disgusting people. The only character who made this novel worth reading was Milady de Winter. In my humble opinion, she is one of the most interesting female characters that were created in this period. She is among the first literary Femmes Fatales to be openly written as the primary villain of a story.Irresistible, merciless and without remorse—this is how she is described inThe Three Musketeers. At the tender age of 22, she has already had an impressive career, including a stint in prison, during which she was given a dishonorable brand on her shoulder, marking her as a criminal.She hid the mark (probably under the pretext of chastity) from her later husband, the Comte de la Fère. But he eventually discovered it, and then tried to hang her (I know … classy). He then ran away and took the name Athos, under which he served the French king as a musketeer. However, the lady's pretty neck withstood the rope, and the two walked the earth believing that their respective partner was dead.Whilst Athos was off fighting for the King, Milady also made a name for herself as a capable and beautiful spy who offers assassinations of high dignitaries in exchange for the elimination of her own enemies. At age 22, she truly was that bitch and had all the men in her nearest vicinity shook. I mean, she kept poison in her ring (for emergency purposes, duh), she seduced men left and right (even those who were explicitly warned about her), she planned the assassination of her enemies with success, she fucking stabbed herself to prove a point (which is a fucking mood) and she raised herself from being a beggarly nun to a respected lady-spy with millions at her disposal.And even though she is written in such a badass way, it’s still interesting to think about the paradoxes in how she is portrayed. I mean, she is described as being brilliant, seductive, ruthless, and demonic, so much so that the musketeers are actually terrified of her. However, at the same time, she also often outwitted and fooled. [I mean, not to re-hash the rape scene but it does make you wonder why she didn’t recognise d’Artagnan in the dark … it’s just such a lazily written plot-device, I cant.]And so, on the one hand, Milady is demonized, which was indispensable because her head does roll by the end of the novel (I know, it’s so sad, I’m still not over it), so Dumas needed to clearly brand her as the enemy and leave little room for empathy for her, so that he could kill her off in peace without getting shit from his readers. But on the other hand, we are also supposed to root for our “heroes” and therefore, they have to outsmart her, even though that’s kinda illogical, since Milady has been portrayed as this demonic mastermind all along. It’s just a little too convenient. And if you, like me, didn’t fall into the trap of thinking of the musketeers as “heroes”, then the treatment of Milady throughout the novel becomes even more infuriating and appalling.I said it in a video before but I truly think that Milady and Edmond (from The Count of Monte Cristo) are two sides of the same coin. They are eerily similar, but while the former is treated like the ultimate source of evil in her tale, the latter is hailed as the hero in his. Just like the Count, Milady comes from nothing. At a young age she is condemned and whipped (by a priest in a convent) and thrown into jail. And whilst Edmond’s prison break is admittedly more iconic, Milady’s is also legendary (and somewhat more realistic): she simply seduces her jailer. We stan.After being branded on her chest with the fleur-de-lis (the mark of a criminal/ prostitute) and all that bullshit between her and Athos, Milady, just like Edmond, has to reinvent herself in order to make a name in high society for her. And she succeeds at that. Just like the Count, she has to mask her true identity in order to stay on the playing field, also by use of various different aliases. [If the two of them had to go head to head in regards to who came up with more ridiculous code names, I’m not sure who would win.] And, most importantly, the two also share the same ultimate goal, the same reason that drives all of their actions: the execution of revenge on the men who have wronged them in the past.So, as you can see, they’re basically the same character but because Edmond is a man (and therefore a protagonist) he is allowed to thrive and be celebrated, while Milady is that evil bitch that gets guillotined by the end of the book. Not fucking fair.All that remains to say is thatThe Three Musketeersleft much to be desired. We think of D’Artagnan and his crew as heroes, simply because we’re told they are.

If this is even half as good as The Count of Monte Cristo I will bow down before Dumas and get him into my olympus of favorite writers., error: This review has been a long time coming. I readThe Three Musketeerslast year in August. Back then, I had high expectations for the book because a couple of months prior, Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo had become one of my favorite novels of all time and I couldn’t wait to check out more by this brilliant writer. Unfortunately,The Three Musketeerswas a huge disappointment. Sure, there were some funny scenes and captivating moments but all in all, I was truly shocked by how unlikeable (and highly problematic!) our four main protagonists were.D’Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis are absolute shit-heads; so much so that I simply couldn’t root for them at all. But before we get into it, let’s set the scene and remind ourselves whatThe Three Musketeersis actually about: It is the year of our Lord 1625. D'Artagnan, a young nobleman from Gascony, has just arrived in Paris to become a King's musketeer. There he meets Athos, Porthos and Aramis, as well as the Queen's beautiful maid, Constance.Soon he is involved in an intrigue that involves the fate of all of France. Cardinal Richelieu, prime minister of King Louis XIII, is doing everything he can to discredit the Queen in order to further expand his own power in the Kingdom. Heeding his advice, the King is giving a grand ball at which the Queen is to wear the King's gift: a magnificent piece of jewellery with diamond studs. Unfortunately, however, she had given these jewels to her lover, the English prime minister Lord Buckingham.The affair is highly explosive, all the more so because relations between the two countries are very tense. England supports the Protestant rebels of La Rochelle, which is besieged by Louis XIII in a long and gruelling campaign. With the honor of a lady and the stability of the Kingdom at stake, our musketeers decide to intervene. However, the scheming Cardinal has a trump card: his agent, the diabolical Milady de Winter, who will do anything to derail their mission.So far, so good. It sounds like a conventional adventure tale that is bound to have you on the edge of your seat and rooting for the musketeers to preserve the Queen’s honor. Well, it didn’t turn out this way. When actually reading the book, it becomes crystal clear that our supposed heroes—Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan—are actually cruel and criminal. All they do is drink, steal, swindle, or seduce people of lower social classes. Their behaviour is absolutely appalling and disgusting. They even kill other members of their nation’s legitimate military and peacekeeping forces for petty reasons.And to top it all of, D’Artagnan, who is supposed to be our lovely and ambitious country boy, rapes Milady. Yes, you read that right. He actually rapes her. What makes this even more iffy is the fact that most translations of Dumas’ classic have glossed over and altered this scene. However, when you look at the source material it becomes clear that d’Artagnan (in that one fateful scene) pretended to be Milady’s lover, the Count de Wardes, to coerce her into sleeping with him. [If you’re interested in this particular aspect of the story I can only recommend the Richard Pevear translation, as it is the only English translation that is truthful to the source material.]So, yeah, our “heroes”, the people we are supposed to be rooting for, are actually deeply horrible and, quite frankly, disgusting people. The only character who made this novel worth reading was Milady de Winter. In my humble opinion, she is one of the most interesting female characters that were created in this period. She is among the first literary Femmes Fatales to be openly written as the primary villain of a story.Irresistible, merciless and without remorse—this is how she is described inThe Three Musketeers. At the tender age of 22, she has already had an impressive career, including a stint in prison, during which she was given a dishonorable brand on her shoulder, marking her as a criminal.She hid the mark (probably under the pretext of chastity) from her later husband, the Comte de la Fère. But he eventually discovered it, and then tried to hang her (I know … classy). He then ran away and took the name Athos, under which he served the French king as a musketeer. However, the lady's pretty neck withstood the rope, and the two walked the earth believing that their respective partner was dead.Whilst Athos was off fighting for the King, Milady also made a name for herself as a capable and beautiful spy who offers assassinations of high dignitaries in exchange for the elimination of her own enemies. At age 22, she truly was that bitch and had all the men in her nearest vicinity shook. I mean, she kept poison in her ring (for emergency purposes, duh), she seduced men left and right (even those who were explicitly warned about her), she planned the assassination of her enemies with success, she fucking stabbed herself to prove a point (which is a fucking mood) and she raised herself from being a beggarly nun to a respected lady-spy with millions at her disposal.And even though she is written in such a badass way, it’s still interesting to think about the paradoxes in how she is portrayed. I mean, she is described as being brilliant, seductive, ruthless, and demonic, so much so that the musketeers are actually terrified of her. However, at the same time, she also often outwitted and fooled. [I mean, not to re-hash the rape scene but it does make you wonder why she didn’t recognise d’Artagnan in the dark … it’s just such a lazily written plot-device, I cant.]And so, on the one hand, Milady is demonized, which was indispensable because her head does roll by the end of the novel (I know, it’s so sad, I’m still not over it), so Dumas needed to clearly brand her as the enemy and leave little room for empathy for her, so that he could kill her off in peace without getting shit from his readers. But on the other hand, we are also supposed to root for our “heroes” and therefore, they have to outsmart her, even though that’s kinda illogical, since Milady has been portrayed as this demonic mastermind all along. It’s just a little too convenient. And if you, like me, didn’t fall into the trap of thinking of the musketeers as “heroes”, then the treatment of Milady throughout the novel becomes even more infuriating and appalling.I said it in a video before but I truly think that Milady and Edmond (from The Count of Monte Cristo) are two sides of the same coin. They are eerily similar, but while the former is treated like the ultimate source of evil in her tale, the latter is hailed as the hero in his. Just like the Count, Milady comes from nothing. At a young age she is condemned and whipped (by a priest in a convent) and thrown into jail. And whilst Edmond’s prison break is admittedly more iconic, Milady’s is also legendary (and somewhat more realistic): she simply seduces her jailer. We stan.After being branded on her chest with the fleur-de-lis (the mark of a criminal/ prostitute) and all that bullshit between her and Athos, Milady, just like Edmond, has to reinvent herself in order to make a name in high society for her. And she succeeds at that. Just like the Count, she has to mask her true identity in order to stay on the playing field, also by use of various different aliases. [If the two of them had to go head to head in regards to who came up with more ridiculous code names, I’m not sure who would win.] And, most importantly, the two also share the same ultimate goal, the same reason that drives all of their actions: the execution of revenge on the men who have wronged them in the past.So, as you can see, they’re basically the same character but because Edmond is a man (and therefore a protagonist) he is allowed to thrive and be celebrated, while Milady is that evil bitch that gets guillotined by the end of the book. Not fucking fair.All that remains to say is thatThe Three Musketeersleft much to be desired. We think of D’Artagnan and his crew as heroes, simply because we’re told they are. But if we actually look at what is shown, we will quickly realize how despicable and horrifying most of their actions are. And then, this supposedly funny adventurous romp reveals itself to be what it truly is at its core: problematic, unoriginal and not fucking funny at all.//Original GIF \"review\":18/8/2019:Watch me fight all the people who dislike Milady but love the Count... meanwhile, her true identity is concealed by various aliases and her main goal in the story is to get revenge on the men who hurt her, so they're basically the same character.

I can see that. I actually could see a writing style development between the first and the second half of the book.This to say that, since from the beginning, I didn’t expect much.But since I’m here do discuss books and not to dig into the author’s background, I’ll admit I’m not a huge fan of the writing. Too many exclamation points!!!!!!too much self-indulgence in the characters descriptions and actions, and, definitely, too much walking around the edges.Sometimes I like it when a bookshowsits contents rather than shoving them explicitly into the writing as to say “hey, here’s how you’re suppose to interpret said emotion and fact”, and so on.I don't like that, nuh-uh.Plus, most of the time, it really looked and felt like a thirteen-year-old fangirl wrote a fanfiction based on scratches of books she's seen her big sister read.The plot is not bad. There’s magic and princes and the right amount of stabby-stabbing.Not bad, but not breath-taking, either. I'm not giving up, though, because I trust my fellow readers and I believe it when they say it's gonna get better.Well,Now, another thing that threw me almost completely off the Throne of Glass Train, was the main character, Celeana Sardothien.Oh, boy. I had such a hard time with this one.Not only I didn't connect with her and her way of thinking before the very last chapters, she's also made it into my Top 3 of most annoying characters thanks to her immaturity.I think only America Singer fromThe Selectionand Zoey Redbird fromMarkedcould top that, and this is saying a lot.She’s like that popular chick in high school who thinks she’s head and shoulders above the others. She’s like Regina George with daggers and an even snarkier holier-than-thou attitude.Basically Celeana in every single line ever:For someone who's supposed to be a deadly assassin, she's pretty weak and dull. I get it that she's a girl who likes being pretty and wearing nice clothes and dating hot boys (I actually love it when a female character can be girly and badass at the same time), but she's just so narcissistic and stubborn, she never (or rarely) speaks without thinking first, that you can't help but put aside her best sides and focus on the tooth-cringing ones. Sometimes, she really lacks tact, not to mention good manners, and, for the most part, she walks around feeling like she invented the concept of being a badass. I’ve got news for you, Cece. You still have a lot of road ahead.So flipping frustrating.Sure, she had her good moments, I actually appreciated her spirit and braveness in many occasions, but they were rare and ephemeral enough that they couldn’t have overcome the flaws even if Batman himself joined the collab.I really hope she’ll redeem herself, or at least, grow some sense into that little superiority complex-affected brain of hers.To be completely honest, sometimes I even enjoyed this book, but I couldn't help but notice they were chapters or paragraphs in which Celeana was silent or absent or too busy fighting for her freedom to care about other stuff.Ahem, I'll leave the math to you, peeps.Bless the multi-pov option!

Unexpected.Even if Huey, Dewey, and Louie engaged in some sort of inevitable, twisted and confused love triangle, which I’ll never be a fan of, I still couldn’t care enough to let it bother me. Just give me some substance, I don’t care who sucks whose face.Now, at the question, do you ship Celeana with Dorian or Chaol, I'll reply: WHAT EVEN IS SHIPPING ANYMORE.Since, y'know, I think it'd too much to hope Dorian and Chaol will both dump Sardothien, grab a dozen puppies each, and ride their way into the sunset, together.The other characters didn’t really convince me that much (although no one got nearly on my nerves as Miss Main Character did), I felt like there could have been more work behind, just like the whole story didn’t exactly engage me from start to end for the very same reason.You can tell someone didn't really do their best at researching. The setting and the way all characters behave could have been a little more authentic, and, holy crow, theooc-ismwas too much, even for a mediocre book.Still, I think after a good 60%, both the writing and the plot really improve right before my eyes.I’m convinced, maybe, I would have loved this book better if I read it when it first came out.I have too high standards now. really, it's like a curse.I’ve never really followed SJM but I feel like I should give her another chance (brain screaming: I WANT MORE DORIAN AND CHAOL). I’ll try not to let it influence negatively my coming judgment and consider this book an isolated case, and also this series’ chance to prove how sometimes books can upgrade in reverse, and put some more hopes intoCrown of Midnight.Until then, two and a half stars are more than enough.ACTUAL RATINGS 2.5/5{update July 2021: while my opinion on this book hasn't changed at all (Throne of Glass was and still is a let down with insufferable characters and cringey writing) I wanted to make this little update to tell whoever will read this review that I ended up caving and I continued the series, and I'm glad I did, because it really does get better.

            "Translation failed for: I'm afraidthis just wasn't for me. I heard it being sold as GRR Martin'sGame of Throneswritten for the female audience --- well, as a female audience, I am offended. As an avid reader of the fantasy genre, I am saddened that this is marketed as a fantasy-for-females. Thisbeing a YA does not excuse it from being riddled with clichés, painfully obvious foreshadowing, and a ghost of a fantasy worldruthlessly overshadowed by romantic overtones.Fans of fantasy -actualfantasy - I don't suppose would much enjoyThrone of Glass, either. And even though the synopsis makes it soundHunger Games-esque, I'm afraid on that front, you'd be disappointed, too.I would say, if you enjoyedThe SelectionbyKiera Cass, but long for a lessself-abasingcharacter than America, then I think you might enjoyThrone of Glass.I must warn you:this review will be long, and most of it dedicated to a bit of a character study if anything; and whySarah J Maas failed at her character of an assassin. But let's start at the beginning.Celaena Sardothien has spent years in the death camps of Endovier, where she will ultimately spend the rest of her life. Until, that is, crown prince Dorian appoints her to enter in a competition for the title of King's Champion, who will be tasked to do the King's secret bidding. But when one by one, the competitors turn up dead, Celaena knows that something evil lurks the castle.Instead of the action-packed novel I was lead to believe I'd be reading, all I got were ... balls and dances, and then some fight scenes are thrown in there just to make sure we don'tforgetthat this is supposed to be a story of an assassin. No,Sarah J Maas, I hopeyoudon't forget what we came here for.When I say thatThrone of Glasslowers the standards of Fantasy, I mean that it doesn't seem to know much about its own setting.Royal Households everywhere, at every turn of the century, have a set of rules dictating things such as etiquette; what is proper and what isimproper. And these rules don't exist for the sake of it - there arereasonsbehind etiquette: to prevent affronting your peers, for instance. To prevent harmful court gossip. To prevent a crown prince from running around and fathering a thousand bastards before he is even dubbed King, creating more than enough future claimants to the throne.I assume the same applies inThrone of Glass; for instance thereareetiquettes mentioned that deem a prince dancing with only one partner something considerably rude.Soit threw me way out of time and placewhen I found out that Chaol, Captain of the Guards, would enter Celaena's chambers at any time of day he wishes - even when she's still dressed in her scanty nightgown.Even the Prince does this; visiting her whensoever he pleases. You may call me a prude, you may call me many anti-feminist names, but this is not acceptable. Not because I give two cents on what the court would say about Celaena; not that I give two cents whether or not the prince was copulating with her; butbecause this is simply not done. Especiallynotwithout repercussion, if even in the form of social stigma.Celaena had a maid waiting on her - but it seems that all she was good for was putting her clothes on. It wasChaolwho barged in her room, underdressed as she was, just to wake her up. He is aCaptain of the Guards. This should not even be his task!These small, ridiculousignorance of Royal Household etiquetteanddivision of labourmade it seem as if the whole thing was poorly researched. You may argue that this wasnotfeudal England; that this world was built entirely ofMaas' imagination, but things such aslogicshould still apply. And when has iteverbeen logical for aCaptain of Guardsto be responsible for waking up guests? When has it ever beenacceptablefor a Prince to come and go, without repercussion, into a common girl's chambers?But that is exactly the problem withThrone of Glass.The entire premisewasn'tlogical.By this I am of course talking about the King's competition.\"(...) He's hosting a competition. He invited twenty-three members of his council to each sponsor a would-be Champion to train in the glass castle and ultimately compete in a duel.\"... and this Champion of his is tasked ...To work for the King of Adarlan as his loyal servant. She raised her chin. To kill for him (...)But where is the logic fail?you ask me. Allow me to reiterate. He wants aloyalsubject to kill for him, without question, with the utmost secrecy. Yet he chooses thisloyal subjectthrough acompetition. Not only that, he makes hiscouncilmenchoose the competitors for him.I may not be a direct member of a royal family myself, but I know there are things such as courtintrigueandhidden agendasand hell, there are hundreds upon thousands of discrete allegiances and plots being made left, right and centre.Do youreallywant yourfuture, \"loyal\" Championto be handpicked out of a number ofcriminalsand entrusted to yourcouncilmen?The whole competition thing wasn't at all very thought through. In the end, it felt as if it was just there to get the story going, to get Celaena into the castle.The competition itself was a let downnstead of some fight-to-the-death (or similar) trope, we get ... a race. An archery competition. Wall-climbing. And a lot of others that happened off screen.Amidst all these competitions and training programs, the plot scattered into flirting banter, gatecrashing parties, and some girl-on-girl hating; as ifthe author wasn't quite sure whether she wanted her novel to be the story of a ruthless assassin, or the romances of a ruthless assassin princess-wannabe.And now I get to Celaena, the princess-wannabe. Allow me to present a number of quotes I've highlighted:She loved clothes--loved the feeling of silk, of velvet, of satin, of suede and chiffon--and was fascinated by the grace of seams, the intricate perfection of an embossed surface. And when she won this ridiculous competition, when she was free ... she could buy all the clothes she wanted.*Everything was wet and half-frozen, and while she could bear sodden hair, she couldn't withstand the agony of wet shoes.*There were more Champions seated at the tables--even the pimply-faced Pelor sat near Chaol! A half-rate boy assassin! She bared her teeth. How dare she be denied an invitation to the feast?You read all that and tell me, do you imagine these thoughts coming from a renown, world-classassassin?An assasin complaining about her wet shoes?About not being invitedto a banquet?No. Two things strike me here: First,she had just spent years at adeath camp, but her behaviour upon leaving it did not portray any humility or gratefulness of being far away from all those whippings and forced labour. You'd think she'd just be glad to be away from the mines and pickaxe to becomplaining about wet shoesSMH.Second;this sounds more like something a ditzy princess-wannabe would say. Oh, after I win this competition,I'm gonna buy myself some clothes. For someone who has spent years suffering, who spent her childhood being trained as a ruthless killer, she comes across sounding soprivileged.Now, I'm not an assassin. I've never beentrainedas one, but for years Ididgo through a whole series of martial arts before finding one that suited my small stature. And ofallmartial arts -- from karate to jiu-jitsu to wushu to the one I finally settled with -- there wasone thingwe were taught was the foundation of any great martial artist.Discipline.And I'm sorry, Celaena. Butyou don't have it.This is her reaction tofailing at a game of pool:A shriek of rage ripped from her throat, and Celaena ran over to the pocket. She first screamed at the ball, then took the cue in her hands and bit down upon the shaft, still screaming through her clamped teeth. Finally the assassin stopped and slapped the three ball into the pocket.This is her discipline at training:\"It's cold,\" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn't care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions--she needed sleep.\"I'm afraid it doesn't work that way; you don't get to tell me that this girl is an accomplished, feared assassin at the age of.... sixteen?.... buther entire mentality, her entirepersonalitydoes not ring true of an assassin.Do you think the realm's greatest killer would be afraid ofwalking in a glass house?\"Only an idiot would walk in a house made of glass.\"(...)The thought of standing on floors of glass made her queasy.....afraid ofheights?She had a terrible headache around her left temple. Everything was sickly and frail. They were so high up, so dangerously high ...Do you think they moan and whinge and complain at the drop of a hat?Once they'd finished their run, they trained in a private room far from her competitor's eyes. Until, that is, she collapsed to the ground and cried that she was about to die of hunger and fatigue.*Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. \"I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.\"For heaven's sake, you're an assassin, not a supermodel. No. Discipline doesn't just mean getting up every morning and training every day. It also means adiscipline of the mind. It means self-restraint. It means keeping your head low. What kind of assassinwantsto be the centre of attention?? To have her skills known?? If you want glory, then you're in the wrong career path. Be a damned knight.But Celaena isvainandself-absorbed. Shewants to be in the spotlight.\"I hate all these guards and nonsense; I hate you telling me to hold back when Brullo sings Cain's praises and I'm just there, boring and unnoticed in the middle.\"*\"Do you know how insulting it is to pretend to be some nobody thief from a small city in Fenharrow?\"Not only that, but she's also very contradictory and hypocritical:What was a \"Champion\" but a dressed-up name for murderer? Could she actually stomach working for him?And I suppose \"assassin\" is just a synonym for mercy-killer? But enough of her faults.Let's take a look at her more positive attributes.She's beautiful. In factsobeautiful that she drains the blood out of peoplewho sees her:Celaena smiled smugly to herself as she nodded to a passing noble-man, who raised his eyebrows at the sight of her. He was immensely pale, she noticed as he opened his mouth to say something, but Celaena continued down the hall.In factsobeautiful that other ladies envy her and she has to shove that in their facesbecause you can't have a YA novel without other girls being envious of our heroine!:She smiled at the young chevaliers as they passed--and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn't blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it. Even Redd, one of the handsomer guards posted outside her rooms, had said so.Also shallow, as it seems, because if Reddhadn'tbeen handsome, his opinion wouldn't have mattered, right?Still not convinced that she's shallow?Why did Chaol never joke with her as Dorian did? Perhaps he truly didn't find her attractive. The possibility of it stung more than she would have liked.You see,because people can only like you if you'reattractive. Oh, sorry, I got sidetracked. We were talking over herpositiveattributes. Well, she's a great dancer:She didn't falter a single step, nor did she seem to care about the many angry female faces that watched as dance after dance passed and they didn't switch partners.She also plays ameanpianobecause music is like, the way we show just how deep and artistic our heroine is:Celaena eyed the pianoforte. She used to play--oh, she'd loved to play, loved music(...)Shelovesdogsbecause that's how we know she's a kind-hearted person. No evil person is an animal lover!:\"Of course I want her,\" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. \"But I want her trained. I don't want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shows and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over (...)Oh, but she doesn't want to beinconveniencedso she doesn't want totrain it herselfof course! She speaks foreign languages,and!just so we canallrelate to her-- she also loves books!I could go on andpoint out her inconsistencies, but this is getting much too long for my liking. In short,Celaena Sardothien is a Mary Sue. But even worse --she is anunlikeable, vain, shallow, self-centred Mary Sue. And if you expect me to believe she's a deadly killer, then you better think again.But that is the final problem I had with this book -- the narratorconstantlytells us what to believe.There was something great and deadly concealed within her, and he didn't like it.while moments later, she's rolling on the ground, crying and whinging that she's gonna die of starvation. Yeah, no.Also,\"Because it looks like he's in love with her,\" he said, and walked away.(...) His shoulders were straight, his back erect. He looked like a man. Like a king.Yeah, if you say so.But,you say to me,there must besomethingyou liked?Well, Ididlike Celaena's relationship with the err, Indian princess. I forgot her name. Because I didn't like the actual princess herself -- she doesn't know tact. She doesn't know diplomacy. She comes to a foreign realm and all she does is whinge and insult their language and clothes and court.So, no. I didn't like the plot, I didn't like the characters. The only stars go to Chaol for being a beacon of sanity amidst all the awfulness. It's a pity he, too, fell for our Mary Sue., error: I'm afraidthis just wasn't for me. I heard it being sold as GRR Martin'sGame of Throneswritten for the female audience --- well, as a female audience, I am offended. As an avid reader of the fantasy genre, I am saddened that this is marketed as a fantasy-for-females. Thisbeing a YA does not excuse it from being riddled with clichés, painfully obvious foreshadowing, and a ghost of a fantasy worldruthlessly overshadowed by romantic overtones.Fans of fantasy -actualfantasy - I don't suppose would much enjoyThrone of Glass, either. And even though the synopsis makes it soundHunger Games-esque, I'm afraid on that front, you'd be disappointed, too.I would say, if you enjoyedThe SelectionbyKiera Cass, but long for a lessself-abasingcharacter than America, then I think you might enjoyThrone of Glass.I must warn you:this review will be long, and most of it dedicated to a bit of a character study if anything; and whySarah J Maas failed at her character of an assassin. But let's start at the beginning.Celaena Sardothien has spent years in the death camps of Endovier, where she will ultimately spend the rest of her life. Until, that is, crown prince Dorian appoints her to enter in a competition for the title of King's Champion, who will be tasked to do the King's secret bidding. But when one by one, the competitors turn up dead, Celaena knows that something evil lurks the castle.Instead of the action-packed novel I was lead to believe I'd be reading, all I got were ... balls and dances, and then some fight scenes are thrown in there just to make sure we don'tforgetthat this is supposed to be a story of an assassin. No,Sarah J Maas, I hopeyoudon't forget what we came here for.When I say thatThrone of Glasslowers the standards of Fantasy, I mean that it doesn't seem to know much about its own setting.Royal Households everywhere, at every turn of the century, have a set of rules dictating things such as etiquette; what is proper and what isimproper. And these rules don't exist for the sake of it - there arereasonsbehind etiquette: to prevent affronting your peers, for instance. To prevent harmful court gossip. To prevent a crown prince from running around and fathering a thousand bastards before he is even dubbed King, creating more than enough future claimants to the throne.I assume the same applies inThrone of Glass; for instance thereareetiquettes mentioned that deem a prince dancing with only one partner something considerably rude.Soit threw me way out of time and placewhen I found out that Chaol, Captain of the Guards, would enter Celaena's chambers at any time of day he wishes - even when she's still dressed in her scanty nightgown.Even the Prince does this; visiting her whensoever he pleases. You may call me a prude, you may call me many anti-feminist names, but this is not acceptable. Not because I give two cents on what the court would say about Celaena; not that I give two cents whether or not the prince was copulating with her; butbecause this is simply not done. Especiallynotwithout repercussion, if even in the form of social stigma.Celaena had a maid waiting on her - but it seems that all she was good for was putting her clothes on. It wasChaolwho barged in her room, underdressed as she was, just to wake her up. He is aCaptain of the Guards. This should not even be his task!These small, ridiculousignorance of Royal Household etiquetteanddivision of labourmade it seem as if the whole thing was poorly researched. You may argue that this wasnotfeudal England; that this world was built entirely ofMaas' imagination, but things such aslogicshould still apply. And when has iteverbeen logical for aCaptain of Guardsto be responsible for waking up guests? When has it ever beenacceptablefor a Prince to come and go, without repercussion, into a common girl's chambers?But that is exactly the problem withThrone of Glass.The entire premisewasn'tlogical.By this I am of course talking about the King's competition.\"(...) He's hosting a competition. He invited twenty-three members of his council to each sponsor a would-be Champion to train in the glass castle and ultimately compete in a duel.\"... and this Champion of his is tasked ...To work for the King of Adarlan as his loyal servant. She raised her chin. To kill for him (...)But where is the logic fail?you ask me. Allow me to reiterate. He wants aloyalsubject to kill for him, without question, with the utmost secrecy. Yet he chooses thisloyal subjectthrough acompetition. Not only that, he makes hiscouncilmenchoose the competitors for him.I may not be a direct member of a royal family myself, but I know there are things such as courtintrigueandhidden agendasand hell, there are hundreds upon thousands of discrete allegiances and plots being made left, right and centre.Do youreallywant yourfuture, \"loyal\" Championto be handpicked out of a number ofcriminalsand entrusted to yourcouncilmen?The whole competition thing wasn't at all very thought through. In the end, it felt as if it was just there to get the story going, to get Celaena into the castle.The competition itself was a let downnstead of some fight-to-the-death (or similar) trope, we get ... a race. An archery competition. Wall-climbing. And a lot of others that happened off screen.Amidst all these competitions and training programs, the plot scattered into flirting banter, gatecrashing parties, and some girl-on-girl hating; as ifthe author wasn't quite sure whether she wanted her novel to be the story of a ruthless assassin, or the romances of a ruthless assassin princess-wannabe.And now I get to Celaena, the princess-wannabe.

            "Translation failed for: \"Oh, you spent a year in India? Well, have you read that bookEat, Pray, Love? She was in India, too! You'd love it!\"If I can forgive Elizabeth Gilbert for being paid upfront to undertake a journey of \"self-discovery\" (and I can--sign me up for \"Clueless in Calcutta\"!), then certainly, she can forgive me for only reading this because I feltobligatedto do so. (And for \"riding her coattails\" in this review, so to speak.)Her style is pretty easy to get into, although I was completely fed up with her sense of humor by I got to the end of the Italy \"eat\" section. There are certainly things we can admire her for: her honesty, for starters, even if she gets really annoying.A style note: I really love that she divided up the book into three main sections, with 36 stories each, for a total of 108 stories. I felt that some of the 36 sections were rather arbitrarily forced into sections, but I still love the set-up.I can't speak for her trips in Italy and Bali, knowing nothing about the culture, but I can speak for India, and it needs it.To sum up the \"Pray\" chapter in one line:Her experience in India was akin to someone coming to America and staying at Disneyland for four months.This is not to belittle her spiritual development there; in fact, I think the India section was my favorite out of the three. I've had friends say that they didn't want to go to India after reading this section, or that it was \"long\" and \"boring\", but I really enjoyed getting inside her head and watching her smooth out some very big knots and minor kinks.When it comes down to it, however, she stayed at an Ashram for the entire duration of her stay in India, only really leaving the compound to drink soda (which, fyi, is called \"Thums-Up\" not \"Thumbs-Up\", and presumably does not have high fructose corn syrup in it, as most Indian sodas use sugar instead).I've been to a few of these compounds, namely, the Root Institute in Bodh Gaya and the Deer Park Institute in Bir. They are modern, clean, and often amazing institutes (Deer Park has a \"plastic room\": they recycle everything, and for those juice boxes and plastic bags they can't? They put them in a room, until the day arrives that they can properly dispose of the material without damage to the environment). For an American tourist, these are great places to go on retreat, because you are largely sheltered from the Indian life outside. You get filtered water, nice and nutritious meals (with low risk of dysentery!), access to hot water (through solar panels, but many places also have heaters that they can switch on for you if it's a cloudy day), Western toilets (over-rated), and you meet some amazing people in these places--usually a mixture of extremely-well-to-do Indians and educated people from around the world. You will, occasionally, meet one or two locals, usually employed by the institutes.But what you experience in these institutes is NOT the culture that lies outside. It's equivalent to Disneyland because you are taken care of, and can pick and choose what you want to do (literally: yoga or meditation? field trip to the fabulous Hindu temple a day's car ride away?), and as American as Disneyland may be, it's only one small facet of what America is and stands for.She mentions, while having a particularly moving spiritual experience, that \"this is the worst nightmare of every American parent whose child has ever run away to India to find herself--that she will end up having orgies with trees in the moonlight.\" I laughed, and asked my mom if she thought that's what I was doing. She didn't say anything, so I said, \"You were probably worried I was havingrealorgies!\"She fails to understand a few key points about India: one, that a female monk, in as many traditions as I am aware, is translated to \"nun\" in the English language; and two, that the reason why flights out of India are often at 4 am is to expediate your transition into another timezone. For instance, if you're traveling from Delhi to Bangkok, your plane will leave late at night so when you arrive in Bangkok, it is morning, and you have to force yourself to stay awake, thus helping you defeat your jetlag. Same with flights from Delhi to New York; I might have been as tired as all hell, but hello New York sunlight!So, would I recommend this book? Probably not, unless you're interested in what a privileged white woman can do with a book advance, or if you're interested in Indian new-age beliefs. This is a bathtub-full-of-bubbles read: completely mindless, but ohhhh pretty bubbles. You might get something out of it, but it is by no means a religious text, or one that's life-changing.The next person that comes up to me, finds out I spent a year in India, and brings up this book is only going to get a sweet smile and, \"Did you enjoy that book? Wait until mine comes out.\", error: „Och, spędziłaś rok w Indiach? No cóż, czytałaś tę książkę „Jedz, módl się, kochaj”? Ona też była w Indiach! Uwielbiałabyś ją!” Jeśli mogę wybaczyć Elizabeth Gilbert, że zapłacono jej z góry za podjęcie podróży „odkrywania siebie” (i mogę — zapisać się na „Clueless in Calcutta”!), to z pewnością ona może wybaczyć mi, że przeczytałam to tylko dlatego, że czułam się zobowiązana to zrobić. (I za „podczepienie się pod jej płaszcz” w tej recenzji, że tak powiem.) Jej styl jest dość łatwy do zrozumienia, chociaż byłam całkowicie zirytowana jej poczuciem humoru, gdy dotarłam do końca sekcji „jedz” we Włoszech. Są z pewnością rzeczy, za które możemy ją podziwiać: jej szczerość, na początek, nawet jeśli staje się naprawdę irytująca. Uwaga dotycząca stylu: naprawdę podoba mi się, że podzieliła książkę na trzy główne części, po 36 historii w każdej, co daje łącznie 108 historii. Odniosłam wrażenie, że niektóre z 36 sekcji zostały dość arbitralnie wtłoczone w sekcje, ale nadal podoba mi się ten układ. Nie mogę wypowiadać się w imieniu jej podróży do Włoch i na Bali, ponieważ nie wiem nic o tamtejszej kulturze, ale mogę wypowiadać się w imieniu Indii, które tego potrzebują. Podsumowując rozdział „Modlitwa” w jednym zdaniu: Jej doświadczenia w Indiach można porównać do sytuacji, w której ktoś przyjeżdża do Ameryki i zatrzymuje się w Disneylandzie na cztery miesiące. Nie chcę umniejszać jej duchowego rozwoju w tamtym miejscu; wręcz przeciwnie, myślę, że sekcja poświęcona Indiom była moją ulubioną spośród trzech. Moi znajomi mówili, że nie chcą jechać do Indii po przeczytaniu tej sekcji lub że jest ona „długa” i „nudna”, ale naprawdę podobało mi się, jak wchodziła do jej głowy i obserwowała, jak wygładzała bardzo duże węzły i drobne zagięcia. Jednak, jeśli chodzi o sedno sprawy, mieszkała w aśramie przez cały okres swojego pobytu w Indiach, opuszczając kompleks tylko po to, aby napić się napoju gazowanego (który, nawiasem mówiąc, nazywa się „Thums-Up”, a nie „Thumbs-Up”, i prawdopodobnie nie zawiera syropu kukurydzianego o wysokiej zawartości fruktozy, ponieważ większość indyjskich napojów gazowanych zawiera cukier). Byłem w kilku z tych kompleksów, mianowicie w Root Institute w Bodh Gaya i Deer Park Institute w Bir. Są to nowoczesne, czyste i często niesamowite instytuty (Deer Park ma „pomieszczenie z plastiku”: poddają recyklingowi wszystko, a co do kartonów po sokach i plastikowych toreb? Umieszczają je w pomieszczeniu, aż nadejdzie dzień, w którym będą mogli prawidłowo zutylizować materiał bez szkody dla środowiska). Dla amerykańskiego turysty są to świetne miejsca na odosobnienie, ponieważ w dużej mierze chronią przed życiem Indian na zewnątrz. Dostajesz filtrowaną wodę, dobre i pożywne posiłki (z niskim ryzykiem dyzenterii!), dostęp do ciepłej wody (dzięki panelom słonecznym, ale wiele miejsc ma również podgrzewacze, które mogą włączyć, jeśli jest pochmurny dzień), zachodnie toalety (przereklamowane) i poznajesz niesamowitych ludzi w tych miejscach — zazwyczaj mieszankę niezwykle zamożnych Hindusów i wykształconych ludzi z całego świata. Od czasu do czasu spotkasz jednego lub dwóch miejscowych, zwykle zatrudnionych przez instytuty. Ale to, czego doświadczasz w tych instytutach, NIE jest kulturą, która leży na zewnątrz. To odpowiednik Disneylandu, ponieważ jesteś pod opieką i możesz wybierać, co chcesz robić (dosłownie: joga czy medytacja? wycieczka do wspaniałej świątyni hinduistycznej oddalonej o dzień jazdy samochodem?), a mimo że Disneyland jest amerykański, to jest tylko jednym małym aspektem tego, czym jest Ameryka i co reprezentuje. Wspomina, mając szczególnie poruszające doświadczenie duchowe, że „to najgorszy koszmar każdego amerykańskiego rodzica, którego dziecko kiedykolwiek uciekło do Indii, aby odnaleźć siebie — że skończy na orgiach z drzewami w świetle księżyca”. Zaśmiałam się i zapytałam mamę, czy uważa, że ​​to właśnie robię. Nic nie powiedziała, więc powiedziałam: „Prawdopodobnie martwiłaś się, że mam prawdziwe orgie!”. Nie rozumie kilku kluczowych punktów dotyczących Indii: po pierwsze, że mniszka, w tylu tradycjach, ile wiem, jest tłumaczona jako „mniszka” w języku angielskim; i po drugie, że powodem, dla którego loty z Indii często odbywają się o 4 rano, jest przyspieszenie przejścia do innej strefy czasowej. Na przykład, jeśli podróżujesz z Delhi do Bangkoku, twój samolot odlatuje późno w nocy, więc kiedy przylatujesz do Bangkoku, jest już poranek i musisz zmusić się, żeby nie zasnąć, co pomaga ci pokonać jet lag. To samo dotyczy lotów z Delhi do Nowego Jorku; mogłam być zmęczona jak diabli, ale cześć nowojorskie słońce! Więc czy poleciłabym tę książkę? Prawdopodobnie nie, chyba że interesuje cię, co uprzywilejowana biała kobieta może zrobić z zaliczką na książkę lub jeśli interesują cię indyjskie wierzenia new age. To jest lektura do wanny pełnej bąbelków: całkowicie bezmyślna, ale ochhhh ładne bąbelki. Możesz z niej coś wyciągnąć, ale w żadnym wypadku nie jest to tekst religijny ani taki, który zmienia życie. Następna osoba, która podejdzie do mnie, dowie się, że spędziłam rok w Indiach i wspomni o tej książce, wywoła jedynie słodki uśmiech i: „Czy podobała ci się ta książka?

Why,I thought so.To all those who still have to start this series and are intentioned to:don’t readA Court of Thornes and Roses. Spoil yourself a little of what happens there andstart with this one. Because -and this is the truly sad thing, as someone else said before me-A Court of Mist and Furycould even be enjoyable if the first book had not happened before.•I won’t go so far as to say that what we have here is a case of lack of “show” and an excess of “tell”, because the first chapters do show that Tamlin, whether for some PTSD or because he has always been a scumbag, undeniably acts like the worst man on the planet. I am even willing to forgive howcaricaturalhis behaviour appears. But, throughout the book, every occasion is a good occasion to throw in a comment tooverturncompletely also all the positive parts of him that are showed in the first book.(In this regard, I should say that inA Court of Thornes and RosesI did not care for Tamlin in any way, so I am not speaking out of frustrated adoration.)In this scenario, Tamlin is the epitome of all evil, while Rhys, of course, the epitome of all good: Tamlin cares for hierarchy, Rhys cares for family and nothing more (ugh); Tamlin wants her caged, Rhys want her free; as it turns out,it was Tamlin’s betrayal to begin the feud between his family and Rhys’s, and so on. I am not in any way saying that a man shouldn’t give freedom to his woman (it’s not that he should;he must, uncompromisingly), or that a plot-twist like the one I mentioned isn’t a good turn of events, even in terms of characterization, but everything is just sostereotypicalandtriteandsickly sweet.All of this,in the name of a ship. I think Maas should understand that falling out of love is just as normal as falling in. People fall out of love for normal reasons even if their exes don’t suddenly turn into maniacs.I am sick of this device, courtesy ofQueen of Shadows, and I don’t need the new love interest to be pushed on me: I am perfectly able to decide for myself.•I’ve seen some reviews in which these two characters are described as complex and multifaceted on the basis of their role reversal. Allow me to say that, in my opinion,nothing about them, in this book, is complex nor controversial.Maas did nothing more than switch their places and their personalities with them: Tamlin was the good one and turns out to be the villain; Rhysand was the villain (somehow, and indeed the Rhysand of the first book is the one I can honestly call intriguing) and now he is nothing short of a Fae Prince Charming.Simple as that.Besides,I liked Rhysandin this book, butI deeply missed the more wicked, morally grey part of himthat we saw Under the Mountain.

Now he’s a thing?-that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I'm thinking maybe he knew that- maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn't work for who- what I am now.\"She hadevery rightto leave the mansion and let him stew for a while, but if that is the result of months and months of undying love, well. He stopped being worth of her love maybe, but I don’t think she fought for it that hard either, especially if he really was dealing with some PTSD. I think love is also about trying to fight for the other person even when they don’t seem to fight for us, to give them time, to give them chances, even though at one point we have to stop.It just would have been nicer and more enjoyable if Feyre’s affection’s shift hadn’t been so swift, that’s it.•All the contradictions. Feyre leave her abusive boyfriend, but then falls in the arms of a man who breaks every bone of a guy who called her names. Uh-uh. And if you say “He did that because he called her ‘whore’, and he’d been called whore too, and thetrauma”, I say: how do you know Tamlin’s behaviour wasn’t due to his trauma too. Maybe he just needed time. But it’s okay if it’s Rhysand that does that because epitome-of-perfection, remember?Hisbeing all possessive is okay. He can say things like “She’s mine” and snarl at people who so much as look at her.

            "Translation failed for: The blurb says:Mason would die to be with Rose...Well that's just silly. If you die to be with someone, you wouldn't be able to be with them, cause you'd be dead! Plus, like everything else in this book, that's such a melodramatic statement.I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what the big deal over this series is. It’s recommended all over the place, the star average for this is really good, and it’s really popular – maybe I got my hopes up too high? I read the first one, was indifferent to it, and then I heard about this series everywhere. It was a series that got better as it went along. There was character development. The heroine was multi-dimensional. Good, strong romance. Interesting characters. So, after a year, I picked up the second one to see if I had missed something and ... eh.On one hand, I do see some positives, like the vampire lore. Most paranormal teen books are painfully simplistic, and I’m glad to say this book does have some world building going on here. I know nothing of vampires, so when I was researching fictional creatures and came across the types of vampires that were in these books, I was quite impressed. Using real mythology to work in your story and giving your own twist on it in a modern setting? Not bad, Mead. If I’m being painfully honest, I thought she just made those words (Strigoi/Dhampir etc) up completely. But hey, come on, some authors don’t even know what happens to vampires when they walk into the sun, not naming any names.And .... that’s pretty much what I liked.I have to laugh when I hear the characters of Vampire Academy being called complex or “deep” – I mean really. Come on. I get what the attraction to Rose is – big mouthed, outgoing, snarky – the exact opposite of the whiny dish mop YA heroines we’re used to, amirite? No, let’s instead make her ANOTHER stereotype and now she’s oh-so-original! Don’t actually bother to make her a three dimensional character, that would be SO MUCH WORK. Just make her the exact opposite of the dish mop heroine, and teens will totally fall for it because she’s so speshul and different – except they DO fall for it! URGH. Rose is just so exaggerated I don’t even really hate her; there’s not enough of her to feel much of anything for. She’s just too obnoxious, too loud, too self-absorbed to really be taken seriously. And to top it off, she’s kind of an idiot. This girl is some kind of guardian for a PRINCESS and she’s about as slow as a heard of turtles racing through peanut butter. Mead has a hard time planning surprises well, because nothing comes off nearly as shocking as it is intended because any semi-discerning reader is smarter than Rose. The secondary characters are all right I guess – I like the witty remarks and all, although none of them make me laugh out loud. Still, it’s nice to have a group of teenagers speaking like teenagers for a change without quoting Latin and Shakespeare. Except Dmitri, who’s about as fun as watching “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” without a bathroom break.Speaking of which, this series is soooo predictable. Can someone please tell me why all teen authors do this? I wouldn’t mind a love triangle, I really wouldn’t, if there was actually a point or at the very least a surprise along the way. If we have three interesting, complex characters, and you like all three of them, then a love triangle can make you ache for them. If you have a hard time choosing between the two boys (or girls, I suppose, but you never see a girl-boy-girl love triangle) then that’s a sign you did it RIGHT. If you don’t know who the girl is going to pick because both boys are so awesome and she sincerely loves them both, then you’re doing it right. WHY DOES NO AUTHOR EVEN ATTEMPT TO DO THIS? Answer: because that would actually require some tough decision making.How do YA authors REALLY write love triangles? You’ve got the main girl, the soul mate, and the poor other guy who you know is going to either end up miserable and alone, dead, or hooking up with some secondary character you barely even remember the name of by the end. I haven’t even read the rest of the series and I don’t have to – I KNOW Rose will end up with Dmitri. I know it the way I knew Bella would end up with Edward, Clary would end up with Jace, Ever would end up with Damen, Luce would end up with Daniel, Tessa with WillHaving finished The Infernal Devices, I'm eating my words on this one and saying the love triangle was actually fantastically done. However, I still firmly, wholeheartedly believe that if Tessa had been forced to woman up and CHOOSE one (misunderstandings and wedding engagements aside), she would have chosen Will., Donna with Xan ... just a few off the top of my head (some of these series aren’t done and I have no intention on reading them, but trust me, I KNOW – I HAVE NEVER BEEN WRONG YET). Even the Hunger Games, which on most days I think is a good series, was painfully obvious with the love triangle – did Gale ever really have a chance? The author can never help but hinting at who her favourite is, and when you know who the favourite is, you’ve got who the girl will end up with. When you know who ends up together, it’s boring. It makes the angst pointless and annoying to read because you know everything is going to end up alright. She’ll end up with the lame, mysterious, brooding guy, because she always does. Screw the guy with a personality and sense of humour.(Sidenote: Have you noticed the readers always seem to like the underdog guy? I wonder why that is. Maybe the author is so busy trying to make everyone love the brooding guy, and she isn’t trying to make the other guy swoon-worthy, that his personality comes out easier. Because Brooding Guy never seems to have a personality.)The writing is terrible by the way. I know, I know, it’s written in the narration of a rather dimwitted teenage girl, but it’s still irritating. The prologue, explaining the story so far was so corny I was grimacing the whole way through. It gets a bit better after that but everything is explained – unfortunately – through Rose, so naturally, it’s all telling, no showing, explaining the most obvious things, the vocabulary never extending past that of a sixth grader and ruining sentimental moments with cheesy, misplaced comments only a stupid teenage girl would say.Look, it’s not the worst book in the world (silly, “Marked” is!) but I can’t slog through what, four more of these? I know what’s going to happen in the end, so I don’t see much of a point in going through hackneyed, predictable trials of these bland characters when I KNOW. Will Rose and her mother reconnect? Will Rose's father be revealed? Will Lissa end up a powerful royal? Which boy will Rose end up with? Will good conquer over darkness?Gee, I have NO FRIGGIN IDEA., error: The blurb says:Mason would die to be with Rose...Well that's just silly.

THE COMPETITION OF A LIFETIME.Now with a story premise like that, honestly I thought it would takea lotto ruin this book for me. 35 girls all competing for one crown and the heart of one handsome prince? Sign me up and bring on the popcorn! However,The Selectionturned out to be one of those unfortunate books that had about twenty-dozen little things in it that just aggravated the crap out of me, with the end result being that I was entertained by it for all the wrong reasons.So first, a word about love triangles. I honestly don't mind themIFthey are done well. But in this case, the love triangle was SO freaking forced, cliche, and angsty, I was ready to tear my hair out strand by strand. The whole thing between America, Aspen, and Maxon was just completely ridiculous (ALMOST as ridiculous as those names), and the motivations behind their actions made absolutelyno sensewhatsoever. There were so many instances of juvenile misunderstanding, miscommunication, etc. that I'm not even going to bother going into specifics. All I have to say is: STOP TRYING TO MAKE THE LOVE TRIANGLE HAPPEN.Moving on, America as a main character was just about two steps away from being completely intolerable. She was-- to put it simply--extremelyannoying (Highlight, underline, and boldextremely). I *might* have been able to stand her if all the little things that were supposed to make her seem like a fun and feisty redhead hadn't come across as painfully redundant and irritating (Oh and by the way- I'm a genuine redhead, so I can tell you right now, we don't act like America Singer). So yeah, by the end, I was pretty much incredibly offended that my redheaded-ness was portrayed in such a pathetic and crappy light. For example, she deniesad nauseumthat she's beautiful even though she clearly is. (Please note, America: False modesty does not make you more attractive-- it makes people want to punch you in the face.) She makes constant quips and remarks about the stuffy life that Maxon leads and he finds it to be cute (it's not). She's got the whole cliche tom-boy thing going on while every other girl is a Stepford clone-- It was just like, OK,I get it, she's one of those totally-gorgeous-but-she's-the-only-one-who-thinks-she's-not girls. And ironically? She stands out in the story because she's so \"different\" from the other girls, while simultaneously being about as cliche as they come.As for the rest of the girls in the book? Well, let's just say that added to the exasperating America Singer, this book just made me hate girls. For real. Even more than ANTM.And the guys weren't any better. Probably because they were about as manly as:Sexy, amirite?Prince Maxon was seriously one of the most awkward characters I've ever encountered-- and not in that adorable, hott kind of way either. In typical Disney prince fashion, he was so perfect and nice that I couldn't even take him seriously. He bored me to tears and was overly-sheltered to the point of being pathetic. And his behavior? It made NO SENSE. Let's review: America wrongly assumes that Maxon is about torapeher-- then she proceeds to knee him in the royal jewels-- then he pretty much brushes it off like a day later and goes back to let's-be-best-friends-because-I-don't-have-any mode. Seriously dude? I've never watchedThe Bachelor, but I'm thinking that if some strange girl told the guy that she had zero interest in him, that she was in love with somebody else, that she was only therefor the food(no I'm not making this up) AND THEN wrongly accused him of being a rapist, I'm going to take a **wild guess** that he would've kicked her out of the mansion on the spot. I mean, that's a pretty serious way to offend someone, no?But then when America tries to explain to him that Celeste the Biotch is sabotaging the rest of the girls, he throws a hissy fit being all like, \"YOU WILL RESPECT MAH AUTHORATAH!\" -- and almost sends her home.Whhhhhaaaatttt???However, Prince Maxon wasn't nearly as douche-baggy as Aspen, the chauvinistic jerk-wad who gets his panties all in a bunch when America tries to make him dinner and then immediately bails on her because he can't handle the helpless, little woman being the one providing for him. This guyseriouslyneeded to grow a pair.Another beef I had with this book was that I couldn't findanycontext for the kind of society that America Singer lives in. HOW did Illea come to be the way it is? What major events led up to the creation of a society where there's a monarchy, an eight-tiered caste system, and two different groups of rebel forces trying to bring it down? Andwhyagain was The Selection created?? (Vague explanation: it createshope. okaaayyyy...) And don't even get me started on \"The History Lesson\" that was randomly thrown in, because it made absolutely NO SENSE (The American State of China? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA). Apparently there was a Third and Fourth World War where the US was invaded by China and then Russia because it couldn't pay off its massive debt.Riiiiiiiiiiight... Explain that one to me, please-- last time I checked, major international superpowers don't behave like 4th graders trying to steal someone's lunch money by giving them a massive wedgie. So, in a nutshell, the \"history lesson\" that attempted to establish the world of Illea explainednothing.So for me, it was difficult to find a connection to this world because it wasn't built on any solid foundation that would have made it remotely believable. And I'm sorry, but if a book can't manage to adequately explain how a society came to be and what the motivation is behind the ones leading it or trying to tear it down (**cough, cough**Matched!**cough, cough**), that for me is a major dystopian FAIL. In the end, I just had to take Illea for what it was-- a make-believe fairy-tale kind of setting that had no plausible explanation for why it exists or how it came to be.Now if the long-awaited, delicious drama of a 35-girl competition hadactually happened, I really wouldn't have cared about the absence of a thought-provoking dystopia. But where the heck was the crazy competition part of the story?? That wholeBachelorspin-off was the number one reason I was looking forward to reading this book in the first place! And the entire thing ended up being one big snoozefest. There were some random acts of cattiness and backstabbing, a few girls got kicked off, a few dresses got ruined, but hardlyanythingwas explained and there was little to no build-up. What happened to--Not only was thereno drama, but I honestly couldn't have cared less about who got kicked off and who stayed. Note to the author: If you aren't going to even bother telling your readers WHO your characters are, WE AREN'T GOING TO GIVE A CRAP WHEN THEY GET BUMPED OFF. We have ZERO investment in them. So faceless, never-before-mentioned Girls #1, 2 and 3 got the ax? Umm, yeahdon't care. No shock value. And Celeste the spoiled little rich girl? C'mon now, she was one big glaring stereotype and had about as much personality as a thumbtack. It wasboring!! And one of the girls was namedTiny. I'm sorry, but how can I take a book seriously with character names like Tiny, Tuesday, King Clarkson, and Maxon Schreave? (Answer:I can't.) And when the only thing in your dystopia that comes across as being even slightly disturbing is the prospect that one day we will be moronic enough to name our kids \"Tiny\" and \"America,\" well, you've messed up something pretty badly. Just sayin'.So for me, the only thing that this book had going for it was that it was *mildly* entertaining in a mindless kind of way, and there was nothing about it that made me want to seriously punch a hole in the wall. But the rest was either very confusing or highly predictable. Everything from the characters, to the love triangle, to most of the outcomes of The Selection were all very easy to see coming from miles away. I'm sorry, but I really couldn't find anything about this book that was terribly exceptional or interesting and overall, I just wasn't impressed.After this, I think I'll be picking up a book about killer dragons. Or bioengineered war beasts. That really sounds like a good idea right about now...~Lea @LC's Adventures in Libraryland, error: .[**NOTE: This review was not affected by online drama or controversy.

So please don't use them without asking my permission first. Thanks :)]35 GIRLS. 1 CROWN. THE COMPETITION OF A LIFETIME.Now with a story premise like that, honestly I thought it would takea lotto ruin this book for me. 35 girls all competing for one crown and the heart of one handsome prince? Sign me up and bring on the popcorn! However,The Selectionturned out to be one of those unfortunate books that had about twenty-dozen little things in it that just aggravated the crap out of me, with the end result being that I was entertained by it for all the wrong reasons.So first, a word about love triangles. I honestly don't mind themIFthey are done well. But in this case, the love triangle was SO freaking forced, cliche, and angsty, I was ready to tear my hair out strand by strand. The whole thing between America, Aspen, and Maxon was just completely ridiculous (ALMOST as ridiculous as those names), and the motivations behind their actions made absolutelyno sensewhatsoever. There were so many instances of juvenile misunderstanding, miscommunication, etc. that I'm not even going to bother going into specifics. All I have to say is: STOP TRYING TO MAKE THE LOVE TRIANGLE HAPPEN.Moving on, America as a main character was just about two steps away from being completely intolerable. She was-- to put it simply--extremelyannoying (Highlight, underline, and boldextremely).

            "Translation failed for: So 1st I have to say that I love Mead. But this book was only OK to Good for me which I guess was a disappointment. I think she could have & has done much better. To summarize, I didn't feel as emotionally connected to the characters & I expected to be, esp after the last book. But also - I think structurally, the book was too condensed & didn't have to be.OK so here I go,SPOILERS for VA #4 - BLOOD PROMISE BELOW:I felt there was far too much recap of the previous 3 books. Literally - it was the entire first 25% of the book. Actually a bit more. I felt she wasted words, describing scenes & scenarios that didn't need to take up that much space & there could've have been far more time spent on the meat of the story & character development - to me (Rose esp) stayed very.....level. There weren't major emotional ups or downs & when the \"epiphanies came\" I didn't feel that were as startling & profound as they could've been.The ending, I felt was all very rushed & wrapped up. The make-up with Lissa, Adrian, the school, Christian, her mom & even Abe, in order to get to the 'Surprise!' ending that Dimitri is pulling an Angel & coming after Rose. How predictable.Like we didn't know he was still alive? Esp. after that anti-climatic bridge scene? And then the whole, \"it's a fairy tale\" bit about the ring.....?But the fact that Rose didn't have really have an emotional aftermath after doing something like killing D. - especially after leaving everyone, hunting him for 5 months & being held captive by him for weeks while he's Strigoi- was not only a bit shocking for me, bit tipped me off that he wasn't really dead. That & also, knowing Rose is getting 6 books, I figured Mead wouldn't have him die so soon (although, I think she should have done it - it would've wiped out the major Buffy storyline comparisons that are coming).And I get it.... Why Rose wasn't allowed the emotional aftermath & the reason is b'c Mead spent too much wasted time the 1st quarter of the book, so by the end, she had to hurry & cram in all action (Avery/Lissa), in order to get Rose home pronto so everyone could forgive her quickly.So here's the thing - did Rose have a lobotomy? Where was she? Throughout the whole book I felt she lacked energy & no, not b'c she was in a blood induced haze. She just wasn't believable. When she was recounting her time with Dimitri at his funeral - it was funny b'c Rose asks Sydney how everyone seemed to know about her & Dimka & Syd tells her that it was written all over her face & I thought,I assume so. I guess you had to be there b'c I'm with Rose, how the hell could they even tell, b'c her words in her grief was so underwhelming.Even when she encounters Dimitri for the 1st time - it lacked the full emotional impact for me. And her dream sequences with Adrian?? She was acting liked a spoiled child. Had she learned nothing over the past 4 weeks (& that's the other thing - I figured she was gone for like, 3 months - 5 weeks??! That's it!)?Dimitri as Strigoi? There were parts that were genuinely chilling but I felt it really could've had been much more intense. Much scarier. Much more confusing for Rose. Sorry Mead - but if you're gonna pull an Bad Angel before he gets his soul back again, you should've taken better notes. But...obviously, The hunt is for the next book but I'll get to this in a bit.I'm annoyed by her use of Adrian, I feel like he is more of a prop than anything else. Which is a shame. To me, he shouldn't be relegated to Scooby Gang/Xander status.I thought Christian not really cottoning on & giving up on Lissa so quickly was yet another fault of early plot timing being wasted.He tells Lissa it had been rough b'c the time before the incident at the Royal Court, she got so mad b'c he wasn't going. Umm.....that was only one other time. It didn't get bad until Avery was there so presumably, that was the only major fight (& it wasn't even) that we saw. Christian is smarter that that & knows Lissa better than that & all she has been dealing with in battling the darkness of spirit. Another quickly dealt with scenario I didn't buy.And really, how stupid could Rose be? She was in Lissa's head for god's sake! Not to realize that there was something very wrong was Mead having a major brain fart to allow that. It bothered me that she didn't smarten up until it was almost too late. These people are supposed to be BEST FRIENDS. Not only that but BONDED by something hugely mystical. Are you kidding?Personally, I think if Mead spent less time recapping the 1st 3 books, she could have had a narrative prologue about what happened & left it at that. Then, started off the book w/ Rose grappling with her grief more genuinely & had Dimitri enter quicker. I think it would have been more successful suspense wise, to have had both his capture of her & her kill of him happen much earlier.The reason being, I think it would've been much, MUCH more of an emotional impact if Mead showed the poignant in the aftermath of Rose killing Dimitri by her returning to school & trying to adjust & make amends & just get on.Mead could've shown all the new adjustments & more personal growth which came as a result.Then,once she starts putting her life back together, things are starting to look brighter, she starts dating Adrian.. the reader gets comfortable by having had time to believe/ adjust that Dimitri is actually dead...THEN pull out the big surprise guns. That's when Dimitri's hunt of her & her loved ones begin. Even better, have it start anonymously for the last few chapters (at least) & then the big cliffhanger would've been the package & note.That would've been seriously cool & chilling. But instead, the book left me feeling it lacked heart. It just emotionally plateaued the whole time. Yeah, I was disappointed.There was also continuity issues. When Rose is held captive, she was clearly there for a few days & yet when she enters Lissa's head, Lissa was feeling guilty for the kiss incident from the night before.I seriously hope Mead loses the need to do such heavy recapping 5 books in. I have no idea why the publishers make author's do that.I mean, I do but it's a HUGE waste of talent & smacks of money grubbing & I hope Mead doesn't buy into it as much with the next book. Anyone that is going to pick up a series which is NOT stand alone, should have the smarts enough to read from the beginning. It's the reader's own fault if they're too lazy not to.(BIG SIGH) I just love Richelle Mead so much as an author. I just wish this was up to her usual standard., error: So 1st I have to say that I love Mead. But this book was only OK to Good for me which I guess was a disappointment.

            "Translation failed for: Contains some minor spoilers.I disliked this book, which means I ought to rate it one star, but it is not as awful as my one star shelf. One star books have to really repulse me to get that rating. The only redeeming thing aboutThe Night Circusis that I didn't feel the one star compulsion to start a bonfire so I could properly dispose of it, hence two stars, but in this case it does not mean I enjoyed the book at all.From the Goodreads summary:\"But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\"The above is a series of filthy, filthy lies intended to make you part with your money. Did the person who wrote the description read the same book I read? Or did he get so bored that he fell asleep and was forced to wing it for a deadline? If that's the case, I feel for the poor guy since I fell asleep reading this a few times, but I don't forgive the lies.Lie Number One:\"A Fierce Competition\"What Actually Happens:Instead of reading about a battle of wits, ingenuity, and talent taking place on a magical field you get two slugs racing against each other... over the course of sixteen or so years. Yeah, all those extra years might kill the intensity, but think of the emotional investment you make in those slugs. You can bring your new born baby to see them and go again every year as the fierce competition between the two of them goes on and on and on and on and on...and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.Your child will have a driver's license when the fierce competition is over.Lie Number Two:\"A Duel\"What Actually Happens:For a significant part of the story the two 'dueling' magicians are raised separately with no knowledge of one another. For ANOTHER significant part of the story only one magician is aware of who they are 'competing' against. By the time the magician who was unaware is finally brought up to date they have been collaborating on projects for years... Yes, you read that right. They never stand toe to toe in any sort of competitive sense. They build little attractions for the circus and sometimes they built them together, leaving gaps for the other to fill because they like each other's work. This is how they 'fiercely compete' during their 'duel.'Lie Number Three:\"Trained Since Childhood Expressly For This Purpose\"What Actually Happens:This sounds like a warrior toddler getting out of bed and doing push-ups (or the magical equivalent) every day for forever with the intent of search and destroy. In reality, they both have haphazard educations from sociopathic father figures* who never tell them a damn thing about the competition. They don't know what they're doing or how to play the game (and neither does the reader for most of the book). I believe this is because the author had no idea how to make them actually compete or what she was doing beyond establishing a lot of overly descriptive scene setting. The training is just education from two different schools of thought on the subject of magic. They're not given any idea of how to be the victor.

The previous \"battle\" before this one (I'm sneering at that) lasted thirty-seven fucking years and only ended because one of the magicians committed suicide. There's absolutely no sense of urgency in this book. It moves at the languid pace my grandmother's overweight poodle used to meander around at, like there was no where to go and nothing to do. The author tries to force some urgency and pacing in by having both characters willing to lose the game so the other can win... but why? If you're playing a game of Monopoly with a friend (Monopoly might be too exciting a comparison to use here but lets work with it) and someone's going to need to commit suicide at the end of it then you... don't stop playing. You don't even have to sit at the board all day every day. You can come back once a year and make a fucking move. No one in their right mind would jump up and yell'I shall die for you my dearest!'especiallyif you know your friend will jump up and say the same thing louder.I don't know what happens if no one commits suicide? Does someone self-implode from excess magic? We never find out anything substantial. We don't know how past competitions ended beyond that single one. The book is left open-ended so that the publishers can milk this monstrosity all over again if it sells well.Lie Number Five:\"Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\"What Actually Happens:After many, many years of not knowing who the other magician is, Marco reveals himself to Celia. The author tells you sparks fly. Sparks do not actually fly because these two 'characters' are about as flat as they come. There's no resisting falling in love. They just decide to do it in true Edward/Bella/Twilight fashion. There's no \"deep, magical love\". The love story is next to non-existent. On top of that, Marco continues to see someone else for years after... why? I don't fucking know. But it's a big god damn deal because she goes nuts and disrupts some of the magic of the circus and allows Bad Things to happen.There's so many other things wrong with the book. There's intertwining timelines. We jump back and forth decades in time, vanish off into characters who are at first totally unrelated to the circus and then have minor roles later on. None of the core characters are well-developed and none of the relationships are even remotely worth reading about. I don't get why the book is set in the period it was set in. Social standards aren't kept up. Maybe it was more atmosphere? Maybe it was so that the author didn't have to deal with the people who would show up to debunk the magic of the circus.On that note, the magic was so obviously magic that I got annoyed.

The only reason to read this book is the lovely descriptions and abundant scene setting. I do not recommend it to people who like a good story, although if you're into abundant prose give it a whirl. It's kind of like reading a travel brochure while high as a kite.Edit: To anyone who has not read the book and might be making their decision to read/not read based on this review, I wanted to say many people I respect found more redeeming qualities in the book than I did.Hereisone such review. Based on my experience, I still recommend reading sample chapters online first or a library trip., error: Contains some minor spoilers.I disliked this book, which means I ought to rate it one star, but it is not as awful as my one star shelf. One star books have to really repulse me to get that rating. The only redeeming thing aboutThe Night Circusis that I didn't feel the one star compulsion to start a bonfire so I could properly dispose of it, hence two stars, but in this case it does not mean I enjoyed the book at all.From the Goodreads summary:\"But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.\"The above is a series of filthy, filthy lies intended to make you part with your money. Did the person who wrote the description read the same book I read? Or did he get so bored that he fell asleep and was forced to wing it for a deadline? If that's the case, I feel for the poor guy since I fell asleep reading this a few times, but I don't forgive the lies.Lie Number One:\"A Fierce Competition\"What Actually Happens:Instead of reading about a battle of wits, ingenuity, and talent taking place on a magical field you get two slugs racing against each other... over the course of sixteen or so years. Yeah, all those extra years might kill the intensity, but think of the emotional investment you make in those slugs. You can bring your new born baby to see them and go again every year as the fierce competition between the two of them goes on and on and on and on and on...and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.Your child will have a driver's license when the fierce competition is over.Lie Number Two:\"A Duel\"What Actually Happens:For a significant part of the story the two 'dueling' magicians are raised separately with no knowledge of one another. For ANOTHER significant part of the story only one magician is aware of who they are 'competing' against. By the time the magician who was unaware is finally brought up to date they have been collaborating on projects for years... Yes, you read that right. They never stand toe to toe in any sort of competitive sense. They build little attractions for the circus and sometimes they built them together, leaving gaps for the other to fill because they like each other's work. This is how they 'fiercely compete' during their 'duel.'Lie Number Three:\"Trained Since Childhood Expressly For This Purpose\"What Actually Happens:This sounds like a warrior toddler getting out of bed and doing push-ups (or the magical equivalent) every day for forever with the intent of search and destroy. In reality, they both have haphazard educations from sociopathic father figures* who never tell them a damn thing about the competition. They don't know what they're doing or how to play the game (and neither does the reader for most of the book). I believe this is because the author had no idea how to make them actually compete or what she was doing beyond establishing a lot of overly descriptive scene setting. The training is just education from two different schools of thought on the subject of magic. They're not given any idea of how to be the victor. It's an experiment, which is vastly different from training a warrior as this is made to sound.*The father figures are equally psychotic, suggesting that both of their philosophies are fundamentally flawed because they're both batshit crazy. One slices his daughter's fingers open over and over again to teach her how to heal herself, even smashes her hand to break her bones for a lesson, and the other does not know his ward's name until he is nearly an adult. Neither of them ever face any consequences for the things they do to the children or the many experimental children before them.Lie Number Four:\"Only One Can Be Left Standing\"What Actually Happens:Aside from the obvioushappily ever afterending the author works in, there's no reason that one of them has to die.

It’s either you really love it or you really hate it. Sadly, I’m one of those closer to hating it.Before you read this book, I must state two things.1.DO NOT TRUST THE BLURB & THE REVIEWS WRITTEN ON THE BACK OF THE BOOK. THEY ARE SO MISLEADING AND WILL RUIN YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF THIS BOOK.Seriously, whoever wrote those deserve to get fired, they completely misled me into buying this book with wrong expectation.2. The Night Circus is not a plot centered book, it’s not a character driven book,it’s a setting centered bookand guess what the book is about? (Hint: the title). This is literally what the book is about.I’ll get around to them later but first I’ll start my review with my favorite part of the book, the writing and setting.I can’t stress this highly enough, just look at all other reviews on this, even from those who gave this book 1-3 stars, everyone agreed that Erin Morgernstern’s writing is an absolute beauty. Everything in this book is written so beautifully and enchanting that it made me really wish a circus like this do exist.The setting, the clothes, the magic and even the food are so magical and written in so much detail. (Seriously, prepare to play Hunger Games on your fridge.) Honestly, Morgernstern’s writing alone truly deserves 5 stars, it's the only reason why I still gave the book 2.5 stars even though I have so many problems with it.I like to think of Morgernstern writings as makeup.You know when you put on makeup to make yourself more pretty or hide the imperfection such as pimple on your face? This is exactly the case.It’s like Morgernstern conjured a spell of BB Cream and Concealer to hide the fact that there’s so many problem within the book.Now I’m going to talk about the problems, remember that this is all just my observation and opinion.1. The main characters developments are close to none.For me, great character developments are one of the most important factors in my love for any book. Other than Bailey, Widget and Poppet (which don’t have enough appearances, Bailey should’ve been the main character rather than Marco or Celia.) I seriously don’t give a shit what happened to any of the other characters because they’re all so flat. There’s just not enough development on them to make me really care. Even after knowing what happened to some of the characters in the book at the end, the only reaction I could give is2. Extremely slow paced with no plot progression.I don’t mind slow paced book as long as there is some sense of plot progression, character developments or great climax and satisfying ending waiting for me at the end. In fact, I really love slow paced books which took its time to develop the plot and characters carefully. However, in this book, not only the plot moved at a snail pace, there are so MANY unnecessary parts that could be cut out. Page 220-350 is a major snooze fest for me. All they talk about is the Night Circus over and over again which I get it already, it’s magical. The color of tents is black and white, there’s a majestic clock and a white bonfire, stop repeating them over and over again! These 100+ pages could’ve been used to develop the characters and plot more but no, we get tons of repetitive description again on The Night Circus and unimportant information.Now let’s talk about the most misleading part in the blurb as well as the rest of the problems. (yes there’s still more.)1.“A fierce competition is underway”and“The circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will”I can’t say much about these without spoiling the ending but I’ll say this, there’s no FIERCE competition at all. Don’t expect any kind of skill, action or magic rivalry, there is none. Even the main characters don’t know what the competition is about until around page 400 out of 500 which is really dumb. By the time it was revealed, it was super underwhelming and provide no intensity to the story whatsoever.2.“Morgernstern manages to conjure up a love story for adults that feels luxuriously romantic” –The Washington PostWhoever wrote this is either a kid, someone who read a different book or batshit insane cause the love story that occurred in this book is definitely not a luxuriously romantic adult love. It’s instead one of my most hated trope in books,insta-love.The love stories happened twice in this book and guess what? Both of them involved one of the main character,Marcoand are both insta-love. Both happened within ONE CHAPTER on their FIRST TALK with each other. The magicians in the story, especiallyMarcoseriously need to use some of their magic to keep control of their libido. It will save some of the major conflicts that happened in the book.Overall, I don’t like the book and I’m really disappointed with it. It starts off really great only to loses its charm and magic quickly. Inflicted with a lot of problems, this is currently one of my lowest rated books in my bookshelves. I should state this though, if you’re looking to read something magical, beautiful settings with absolutely beautiful writings ONLY, I’ll definitely recommend this. However if you’re looking for something with great story, satisfying ending, fantastic characters development, great romance or even an ant sized of actions, nope, I can’t recommend this book. You won’t find any of them here, I’d even tell you to stay away but again, all of this is purely my opinion and my review, you could end up loving it much more than I do.As I mentioned in the beginning of my review, it’s either you hate it or you love it.

            "Translation failed for: ➳2/5 stars\"He is learning to love me unconditionally, under all my conditions\"This book came highly recommended by everyone who knows my love for thrillers. Literally everyone raved about its gripping plot twists, intricate storyline, and masterful execution. However, despite all the hype, I couldn't bring myself to love it. To me, it felt plain and bland, with characters that lacked depth and plot twists that failed to impress. The pacing was slow, making it feel excruciatingly boring at times. Additionally, it felt exaggerated and overextended. It might have been more enjoyable if it had been shorter and more concise, focusing more on the core elements rather than stretching out the story unnecessarily.This book tells the story ofAmy DunneandNick Dunne, a couple who outwardly project the image of a perfect marriage. Amy’s diary portrays them as deeply in love, never arguing, and always willing to make sacrifices for each other. However, on their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy mysteriously disappears, and no one has any idea where she might have gone.As the investigation unfolds, all the evidence increasingly points towards Nick, suggesting he might be involved in her disappearance. Did he kill her? Was she kidnapped? What truly happened to Amy? As the layers of their relationship are peeled back, it becomes evident that their marriage was not as flawless as everyone believed. The story delves into the complexities and hidden truths of their relationship, making me question everything i thought i knew about Nick and Amy.The first part of the novel delves into the investigation of Amy's disappearance. As the story unfolds, we see Nick's dirty secrets come to light and learn about the troubled history of Nick and Amy's marriage through Amy's hidden diary entries. This section aims to build suspense and mystery, yet I found myself straining to connect with it. Despite its intriguing premise, the slow unraveling of events and the intricate details of their relationship left me feeling disconnected and struggling to understand why this portion of\"Gone Girl\"didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped.But then the second part, with its wicked twist, changed everything. The story became much more exciting, dangerous, and deranged. The main characters revealed sides of themselves that were quite shocking, adding layers of complexity and intrigue. This transformation in the plot kept me on the edge of my seat, eagerly turning pages to uncover more of the dark secrets and unexpected turns that made the story so compelling.— SPOILER —Anyways, what truly bothered me was that the plot twist became simply predictable at this point. The book starts with the narrative of Amy disappearing from her own house, and no one in the neighborhood saw her. Even if I ignore this, every single clue pointed toward Nick, yet the police were not taking action, which was the least of my concerns. This book was around 400 pages, and it was obvious that no thriller would unravel its plot twist so early in the story. This made me suspicious of Amy because her diary entries seemed too good to be true. The way she portrayed herself in the diaries and how others talked about her were like descriptions of two different people.The Amy from the diary is sweet, precious, and willing to do anything for her husband, while others, even her parents, described her as bold and fierce, someone who doesn't take anyone's nonsense. In her diaries, she appeared so scared of her husband that she felt the need to get a gun for protection. These contradictory statements about Amy from the beginning made me even more suspicious of her. Eventually, it was revealed that she had planned the entire thing to manipulate her husband into coming back to her after he cheated on her with his student.I mean, I get it, she loved him, or rather, she was so obsessed with Nick that she was willing to do anything to keep him. The lengths this woman went to keep Nick with her were on a whole different level. When it was revealed that Amy was the villain, I wasn't as shocked as I thought I'd be because I guessed it too quickly. However, I found it mind-blowing how she created this entire wicked master plan to show Nick his place, and the way it was executed was fascinating. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Amy and her crazy dark ideas, in fact, the rating I gave was solely because of the masterful plan Amy devised to destroy her husband, who truly deserved it. Despite my frustrations with the story's developments and the unlikable characters, I couldn't help but admire Amy's determination to destroy her piece of shit husband. Her ability to orchestrate such an elaborate scheme was both fascinating and chilling, and it showcased Gillian Flynn's talent for creating complex characters.— SPOILER END —On one hand, I truly appreciate Gillian Flynn’s incredible skill as a writer. She crafts distinct characters with remarkable ease, seamlessly alternating between their perspectives to build a complex, deeply disturbing narrative. The big twist, while not entirely unexpected is executed with such brilliance that it still manages to surprise. The first part of the book keeps you constantly questioning everything you know about the characters, their lives, and their secrets. Everyone seems unreliable, and every detail feels questionable. This constant uncertainty is masterfully done and adds a layer of tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The way Flynn weaves these elements together showcases her talent for creating a compelling and intricately plotted story.But then there's the other side of\"Gone Girl\": the absurdity of certain plot developments and the pervasive hate that rots the novel to its core. I detested the characters, from the unparalleled, misogynistic Nick to the many different iterations of the\"brilliant\"Amy. I hated how the story unfolds in the second part and especially despised the ending. The narrative’s descent into increasingly ridiculous territory detracted from the initial suspense and intrigue. The characters, with their deeply flawed and unlikeable traits, made it hard to find anyone to root for. The pointlessness of the story's resolution left a bitter taste, overshadowing the initial brilliance of Flynn's writing.°˖➴\"Overall, if you're in the mood for a book with a plot twist that feels predictable and an over-exaggerated storyline filled with extremely unlikable characters, then this might just be the book for you!

The book starts with the narrative of Amy disappearing from her own house, and no one in the neighborhood saw her. Even if I ignore this, every single clue pointed toward Nick, yet the police were not taking action, which was the least of my concerns. This book was around 400 pages, and it was obvious that no thriller would unravel its plot twist so early in the story. This made me suspicious of Amy because her diary entries seemed too good to be true. The way she portrayed herself in the diaries and how others talked about her were like descriptions of two different people.The Amy from the diary is sweet, precious, and willing to do anything for her husband, while others, even her parents, described her as bold and fierce, someone who doesn't take anyone's nonsense. In her diaries, she appeared so scared of her husband that she felt the need to get a gun for protection. These contradictory statements about Amy from the beginning made me even more suspicious of her. Eventually, it was revealed that she had planned the entire thing to manipulate her husband into coming back to her after he cheated on her with his student.I mean, I get it, she loved him, or rather, she was so obsessed with Nick that she was willing to do anything to keep him. The lengths this woman went to keep Nick with her were on a whole different level. When it was revealed that Amy was the villain, I wasn't as shocked as I thought I'd be because I guessed it too quickly. However, I found it mind-blowing how she created this entire wicked master plan to show Nick his place, and the way it was executed was fascinating. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Amy and her crazy dark ideas, in fact, the rating I gave was solely because of the masterful plan Amy devised to destroy her husband, who truly deserved it. Despite my frustrations with the story's developments and the unlikable characters, I couldn't help but admire Amy's determination to destroy her piece of shit husband. Her ability to orchestrate such an elaborate scheme was both fascinating and chilling, and it showcased Gillian Flynn's talent for creating complex characters.— SPOILER END —On one hand, I truly appreciate Gillian Flynn’s incredible skill as a writer. She crafts distinct characters with remarkable ease, seamlessly alternating between their perspectives to build a complex, deeply disturbing narrative. The big twist, while not entirely unexpected is executed with such brilliance that it still manages to surprise. The first part of the book keeps you constantly questioning everything you know about the characters, their lives, and their secrets. Everyone seems unreliable, and every detail feels questionable. This constant uncertainty is masterfully done and adds a layer of tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The way Flynn weaves these elements together showcases her talent for creating a compelling and intricately plotted story.But then there's the other side of\"Gone Girl\": the absurdity of certain plot developments and the pervasive hate that rots the novel to its core. I detested the characters, from the unparalleled, misogynistic Nick to the many different iterations of the\"brilliant\"Amy. I hated how the story unfolds in the second part and especially despised the ending. The narrative’s descent into increasingly ridiculous territory detracted from the initial suspense and intrigue. The characters, with their deeply flawed and unlikeable traits, made it hard to find anyone to root for. The pointlessness of the story's resolution left a bitter taste, overshadowing the initial brilliance of Flynn's writing.°˖➴\"Overall, if you're in the mood for a book with a plot twist that feels predictable and an over-exaggerated storyline filled with extremely unlikable characters, then this might just be the book for you!

            "Translation failed for: **WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE, CAPS LOCK OF RAGE, AND OCCASIONAL SPOILERS (we will let you know when spoilers kick in). You have been warned.**Thea’s Take:(There will be spoilers, but I’ll give you warning when they kick in.)I started Gone Girl knowing only these things.Gone Girl is:A. One of the bestselling books of 2012, recipient of multiple awards from critics and readers alike, across genres and categories.B. Gillian Flynn’s latest novel, with a rumored HUGE twist somewhere in its 500 pages.C. Supposedly contains a razor-wire plot, and is some kind of examination of perfection, marriage, and murder in small town, Missouri.I finished the book in less than 24 hours, compulsively turning page after page, needing to know what would happen next, who to trust, how it would all end. And, at the end, I can add one more thing to the list of things I know about this book:D. A brilliantly written and plotted mystery, a miasma of wretchedness and hate; a book that I devoured but deeply, utterly abhorred.I will try to do this as spoiler-free as possible. Gone Girl is the alternating point-of-view, semi-epistolary novel that tells two stories about Nick and Amy. In the first story, Amy met Nick in 2005 and falls in love with him. They get married. It is blissful. Amy is the Best Possible Wife, she’s funny, and smart, and beautiful, and RICH. Things start to go sour, however, when Nick loses his job, and then Amy loses her job and her money, and they move to Nick’s small hometown of Middle of Nowhere, MO, to take care of Nick’s dying mother (cancer) and father (Alzheimer’s). Amy is attentive. She is supportive. She still loves the idea of her husband, though she knows things are falling apart. Nick becomes abusive, hateful, hurtful. And then Amy disappears – just, gone without a trace. In this first story, Nick is Amy’s foil and tells his version of events, after Amy’s disappearance. In his narrative, Amy is brilliant and beautiful, but also controlling, resentful, and hateful. Their marriage is a sham. Amy’s disappearance puts Nick in the crosshairs of the police as the killer – and as the days after Amy’s disappearance pass, the evidence against Nick mounts.And then there’s the second story – and therein lie spoilers. Because everything we think we know about Amy and Nick? It’s wrong. Amy is not who we think she is, and Nick is…well, ok Nick is still douchetastically pathetic. In this second story, we learn more about this toxic couple from hell, and the pit of spite and grief that is their marriage.Like the novel’s dual plot, I’m of two minds when it comes to Gone Girl.On the one side, I can appreciate Gillian Flynn’s skill as a writer. She creates two (ok, three) characters that are completely distinct, and she alternates these points of view with incredible deftness and ease, building a complex narrative – a complex crime – that is deeply disturbing but brilliantly executed. The big “twist” is perhaps not such a twist (you kind of expect it, or you at least know that something is going to happen, that you aren’t playing with a full deck of cards), but it’s done really, really well. The first part of the book makes you question what you know about these characters, their lives and their secrets. Everyone is unreliable, everything is questionable. This is all really fucking good.But then, there’s the other side of Gone Girl: the badness, the utter RIDICULOUSNESS of certain developments, the hate that pervades the novel to its rotten-apple core. This, I did not like. I detested the characters, from the unparalleled pathetic misogynistic doucheparade that is Nick to the many different iterations of the “brilliant” Amy. I hated the way the story develops in the second part of the book, and I especially hated the way that it ends. I hated the pointlessness of the story – why does it need to be told? What does it accomplish? What does it say about us, as people?And here come the **SPOILERS** because certain things need to be SAID:Nick. I can’t really waste too much space on Nick, because he is wholly and utterly pathetic. He whines, he pretends, he is so full of incompetence and ennui and self-important horseshit. He lost his job because TEH INTERWEBS ARE EVIL. No, seriously, he’s unemployed because *whines* people don’t read REAL magazines anymore and the BLOGS are killing everything and these HACKS are destroying the printed word and he’s a REAL JOURNALIST and goddammit he’s someone IMPORTANT and why can’t anyone else understand that? He’s GORGEOUS and all the women want to jump on his disco stick, and Nick hates them all for it – women are just things to him. They are cunts, or psycho bitches, or trying too hard (these are all Nick’s words, of course). He wants to be a MAN and Amy – brilliant, beautiful, spoiled, vindictive, Amy – has stolen that from him. And then, that psycho bitch Amy fucks with Nick’s life, and Nick has to figure out how to prove his innocence because all of a sudden NICK IS THE GOOD GUY.Which brings me to Amy. It turns out that Amy is not the eager to please doormat that she presents herself as in the first part of the book. No, she is an honest to goodness sociopath that has elaborately planned and framed her cheating pathetic loser of a husband for her death. It’s not the first time, either! She’s ruined female friends, and men that have DARED to cross her/make her unhappy (by claiming RAPE, or that people are obsessed with her, and so on and so forth). Amy is brilliant and vindictive, cruel and efficient in her mastermind scheme to bring Nick DOWN. As sick as it is, I actually liked the first twist: Amy’s edge, revealed in the second part of the book, when we find out Amy is alive and that everything she’s written in the first part of the book is a lie. But then, everything starts to unravel and Amy is made out to be not only a people-hating manipulating sociopath, but a completely incompetent one, to boot – she is suckered into a relationship with her neighbors while she’s in hiding and is robbed for all her money (she only lasts for 9 days before she’s robbed! COME ON!). She BELIEVES Nick when he goes on TV and earnestly pleads for his wife to come home, so she does it just like that. Are you fucking kidding me? THESE are the actions of the same methodical, patient mind that came up with this elaborate revenge scheme against her husband? I repeat: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?She then fucks, and kills, and makes her way back into her husband’s life. She then TRAPS her husband into silence and complacence with a Miracle Baby (it’s a BOY of course!) and that makes Nick stay with her forever and always.And that is the end of Gone Girl.There are plenty of other problems, too, but Ana has covered them all, below. Frankly, I’m exhausted, and I don’t want to waste any more time or thought on this novel.I’m done writing now.Ana’s Take:(SPOILERS AHOY)Gone Girl is one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read, one that comes with an inordinate amount of hype and disguised as a “clever”, “dark”, twisterific thriller that supposedly deals with serious shit like “when a marriage go bad”.It follows the story of Nick and Amy’s marriage. It opens on the day of their fifth anniversary, the day when Amy goes missing. Soon – as these things go – the investigators start to focus on the husband. But is Nick guilty? Did he really kill his wife? If not, what happened to Amy?It’s divided in three parts and in part one, the narrative alternates between Nick’s first person narrative as he deals with Amy’s disappearance and Amy’s journal. As the plot progresses, their story is slowly revealed to the reader:Amy is a WEALTHY, BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL, COOL New Yorker whose parents write the Amazing Amy children stories. Nick is a BRILLIANT, HANDSOME journalist writing about pop culture for a magazine. Until Nick lost his job (because the INTERNET IS EVIL), Amy lost hers, and they need to move to Nick’s hometown in Missouri to take care of his sick mother. Their marriage was already shaky but it’s in Missouri that things start to really fall part between them. This part of the story is basically about Privileged White People’s Problems and both come across as entitled WANKERS – especially the aloof man-child Nick who, once his marriage starts to fall apart and money problems hit them, cheats on his wife with a much younger girl (his student). It would be a very familiar and trite story except for the fact that Amy’s journal entries start to show a different side of Nick: one that is increasingly abusive and scary. All of a sudden and in spite of Nick’s protestations, it is obvious that he is hiding something and he might after all, be guilty.Then comes part 2 and the twist: Amy knew that Nick had been cheating on her and for the past year she created this elaborate plan to disappear and frame Nick for her “killing” as vengeance. As such, her diaries entries are all faked concoctions. It becomes clear then that Amy is really, a psychopath. Parts two and three deal with Amy’s attempted revenge, Nick’s realisation of how far his wife really will go, all leading to the eventual showdown between them as Nick wants her back so he can clear his name and maybe kill her or something equally unpleasant.Gone Girl almost had me there for a while – I can vouch for how incredibly readable and engaging it is. I could not put it down and I had to find out what was going to happen to these people. I also thought that structurally speaking – with the alternating unreliable narratives – the novel was competent. It was also a success in the way that it portrayed its two deeply unpleasant, unlikeable main characters. The reader is supposed to despise these people, and loathe them I certainly did although it made for a fucking unpleasant reading experience. Plus, really, these types of “dark” characters BORE ME TO DEATH. But ok fine, this is a very personal reaction.The thing is: because the two narratives don’t exactly fit together in part one, it is obvious that at least one of them is an unreliable narrator, possibly the two. And if a reader is used to reading epistolary novels, unreliable narrators and thrillers, it is easy to know that a twist is coming. Considering all this, is the main twist even that surprising?That said, this is not my main point of contention with the novel. The recurring themes are what give me pause for thought.It is possible to argue that the one of the main themes of Gone Girl is its thoughtful examination of marriage difficulties; or to question how well two people can really know each other or allow the other to know you and, unfair expectations. The problem is: the novel cannot possibly be indicative of all marriages or a heartfelt exploration of this theme because NOT EVERYBODY IS A VINDICTIVE PSYCHOPATH OR A WHINNY MAN-CHILD WITH SOCIOPATHIC TENDENCIES. Unless you know, you want argue that one can never know who one has married because maybe, just maybe your husband/wife is planning RIGHT NOW to fake-kill themselves and frame you because you didn’t wash the dishes after dinner that one time. SO you know, BE CAREFUL. This means that the book only really works on its own microcosm of darkness.Another recurring theme throughout is the question of misogyny. Nick’s father is a deeply misogynistic character and Nick hates his father and lives under the constant fear that he too, might be misogynistic. This is really interesting in the way that it explores the difficulty in getting away from one’s upbringing. Amy on the other hand, is presented as a (kind of) feminist with her astute observations about social gender constructs by constantly calling on the bullshit of unfair social expectations around her gender. So on a cursory glance one could argue that the book is feminist. I’d argue against that. WHOLEHEARTEDLY.What else could I argue when the only obvious feminist character turns out to be a psychopath who HATES EVERY OTHER WOMAN she knows, lies about having being raped, about being stalked and eventually “traps” her husband by becoming pregnant. When the entire story is eventually contrived to show Amy as the True Villain and Nick as the one Nice Guy (despite his aloofness, his cheating, his lies and his manipulative strike) who is not REALLY a misogynist because he doesn’t hate ALL FUCKING BITCHES, he only hates his PSYCHO BITCH wife (his choice of words, not mine, by the way). He is also the one who in the end, needs to contain the psycho bitch by staying with her and helping her bringing up their child. So then all of a sudden this passive-aggressive, liar, stunted, cheater is the HERO?HAHAHA: NO.And you could argue that these PEOPLE ARE HORRID and so of course, it all makes sense. But the NARRATIVE SUPPORTS ALL THIS SHITNESS by presenting every other woman in this novel as HORRIBLE PEOPLE TOO, without nuance. Well, apart from the two obviously good characters who are sympathetic TOWARD NICK: there is this one female cop who just “knows” he must be innocent and his own twin sister who is DUH OBVIOUSLY, so perfect and of course unlike any other woman. Plus, the one guy that Amy has accused of rape turns out to be innocent because really, he is just a Nice Guy and we all know that only ALPHA GUYS are rapists. Nice Guys are NEVER RAPISTS. EVER.HAHAHA: NO.Not to mention that the book COMPLETELY lacks internal logic. The one main thread of the book, the one point that is laboriously written through the first two parts is how Amy is incredibly smart and brilliant. She has to be, in order to manipulate, concoct and maintain all the plans she has over the course of her short life. But then get this, right? Nick concocts his own plan to make Amy change her mind and come back. And his plan consists of appearing live on TV and saying that he forgives her, that he understands who she really is and he loves her anyway. That’s his plan. AND IT WORKS. Amy – psychopath, brilliant Amy – has a change of heart almost as immediately as she watches his interview. And that’s because according to Nick, Amy lacks a “bullshit detector”. BUT the first half of the book was all about setting up and making sure we understood how much of a bullshit detector Amy actually had.So which one is it? Either she is a brilliant psychopath or a gullible idiot. SHE CAN NOT BE BOTH, BOOK.And I am going to nitpick too: Nick is in his early thirties buy he sounds fucking ancient. Like the whole whinny “the internet killed my career” thing when he is at the right age to actually know how to take advantage of the Internet? Please.In summation: I devoured Gone Girl but I fucking hated it., error: **WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE, CAPS LOCK OF RAGE, AND OCCASIONAL SPOILERS (we will let you know when spoilers kick in).

            "Translation failed for: The Neverending StoryBy Michael EndeA Review by Eric Allen.\"ONLY TWO STARS,\" you cry, \"Eric, have you no soul!?!?!\" You're obviously going by the movie, which is AWESOME, and have never actually read the book it was based on, which is not so much.When I was six or seven, the Neverending Story came out, and it was one of the most awesome movies I had ever seen in my life. It was a movie that wasn't afraid to scare the everliving shit out of children, and I loved it for that. Even today, many, many years later, it is still an old favorite that I remember fondly and hope, one day, to scare the everliving shit out of my own children with. The book, on the other hand, is something of a mess. First of all, many people were not aware that it even existed. Fewer people still realize that the extremely terrible Neverending Story II movie was actually part of the book. That's right, the same author that gave you The Neverending Story, ALSO gave you The Neverending Story II. Think on that for a minute and tell me your childhood isn't curled up in a little ball in the closet crying.The book was originally written in German, brought to you on the screen by a German director and crew, and only after the movie was so popular did the book get translated into a few more languages.The plot of The Neverending Story needs no summarizing for most people. It's a very basic telling of the hero's journey story archetype. What makes it so awesome and memorable, of course, is the world in which it takes place, and the fact that the villain was something more abstract than an actual, tangible foe that can be fought and defeated. The second half of the book focuses on the child Bastion, who is pulled into the book after giving the Childlike Empress her new name, which, by the way, people have been asking for years, because that kid is completely unintelligible in the movie. Her name is Moon Child. However, I believe that, for whatever reason, the name was translated literally, rather than left in the original German. Bastion must make his way back to the real world by making wishes, but for each wish he makes, he loses precious memories from his life. And it is only through the help of his friends Atreiyu and Falkor that he is able to return at all.The Good? The first half of the book is excellent. I absolutely love it. The movie stays extremely faithful to the source material. The world is imaginative, the hero is a bit of a blank slate, but likeable all the same, and a lot of the things that he goes through on his quest serve a dual purpose, to both be entertaining, and thought provoking. The use of an abstract concept, the Nothing, as the villain is where I think this part of the book really shines. It's very hard to give a concept weight as a character, but the author did an extraordinary job of bringing it, and all of the horror surrounding it, to life.The Bad? Where this book really falls apart is in the second half. You remember how excited you were to see Neverending Story II when it came out? I know I was. And boy was I disappointed. Well, the second half of the book is pretty much the same. They changed the story drastically to make it easier to make a movie out of it, because there really isn't much in the way of purpose or direction in it. There isn't a real goal, or reason for anything to be happening. Bastion just wanders around, makes wishes, and pretty much accidentally finds his way home again.This boring stretch of nothing happening is compounded by two things. The first is that the first half of the book is so clever, and awesome, and enjoyable, and when you get to the second half it's like running headlong into a brick wall. All of the awesome world, the awesome supporting characters, and even the hero of the story are simply gone, and you're left with only Bastion. And that leads in to the second thing. Bastion is an extraordinarily unlikeable character. It's hard to describe all of the things that make him unlikeable, because pretty much EVERYTHING about his character is annoying or offensive in some way. And after Atreiyu, who is not exactly the most interesting character, true, but a hell of a lot more likeable than Bastion, you feel the contrast all the more.When you actively dislike the person that a story is all about, the story itself is not enjoyable. What creates such things as tension, and drama, are emotional attachments to the characters. If you don't like the character, and don't care whether he succeeds or not, any story woven around him is, inevitably going to be terrible as well. And that is exactly what is wrong with the second half of the book. Bastion is so unlikeable as a character, that I just couldn't have cared less what he was doing, or why, and I certainly didn't care if he was going to succeed or not. You go from a relatively enjoyable protagonist in the first half, to someone who literally has not one single redeeming quality in him as the protagonist in the second half. The fact that there is no readily defined plot for him to participate in makes it even worse, because when there is no real storyline, all of the entertainment value in a story rests wholly upon the characters. The second half of this book is about a terrible, unlikeable character, doing basically nothing but wandering around the world and showing how terrible and unlikeable a character he is.Additionally, this book is not very well written. I'm going to give the author the benefit of the doubt and say that it's probably the translator being unable to convey the original German wording properly into English, and all of the little nuances of prose that make a well written book were lost in translation. But there is probably one thing that was definitely in the original German. The author keeps bringing up what sounds like a really awesome tangent to the story, and then saying, \"But that's a different story and will not be spoken of here.\" Ok... WHY EVEN BRING IT UP IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! Oh my GOD is this annoying. He literally does it like forty times over the course of the book. It was cute once or twice, but it just gets more and more annoying with every time it happens.In conclusion, though The Neverending Story movie will always have a special place in my heart, the book it was based on is better left forgotten. I believe that a lot was lost in translation, when this book was adapted to English, but that can only account for so much. The first half of the book is very enjoyable, with a few odd quirks of writing that I found to be annoying, most of which probably resulted from English not being the original language that the book was written in. The second half of the book is terrible, following a thoroughly unlikeable character as he does absolutely nothing but display what an arrogant douchebag that he is for all the world to see. I do not recommend picking this book up, unfortunately. And if you do, I highly recommend that you only read the first half. The bad more than outweighs the good. Stick to the movie, and remember all the great times you had with it as a child. It's one of the few rare cases of the movie actually being better than the book. The movie, at least, knew exactly when to shut up, come to a conclusion, and wrap things up with a tidy little bow. I wish I could say the same for the book, but I can't. It gets two stars, which is probably one more than it deserves, but hey, nostalgia is a powerful thing.Check out my other reviews., error: The Neverending StoryBy Michael EndeA Review by Eric Allen.\"ONLY TWO STARS,\" you cry, \"Eric, have you no soul!?!?!\" You're obviously going by the movie, which is AWESOME, and have never actually read the book it was based on, which is not so much.When I was six or seven, the Neverending Story came out, and it was one of the most awesome movies I had ever seen in my life. It was a movie that wasn't afraid to scare the everliving shit out of children, and I loved it for that.

            "Translation failed for: This review can also be found onBook Girl of Mur-y-Castell-blog.I’ve been actively reading and reviewing books for a year and a half now. In that time, my criteria for rating a book on the one to five stars scale has changed a couple of times. A few things still hold true. The book has to be exceptional and leave an indelible impression to get a five star rating from me. Three stars remains my meh-rating. It’s a book that I can objectively call a good one, something I might have even enjoyed reading, but it’s also something I can easily forget and move on.My one star rating however, that’s changed the most. At first it was anything and everything I simply didn’t like. If the offences added up to a certain point I’d give it a one star rating no matter what redeemable qualities I’d find in it. But as I read more and actually started thinking about it, I realised there are books that aren’t even worthy of that single star, books that are, to me, beneath contempt. To compensate, I adjusted my personal rating scale and now one star is reserved to books that induce burning white rage in me.I’ve given good ratings to books with characters I’ve hated when I enjoyed the story, and I’ve given good ratings to books with stories I’ve hated even when I loved a character or two. For me, the style matters little, but dammit, it matters.And I’m not talking about the clunky language that in a way fits the subject and the legend, but takes a while to get used to.Ms. Bradley set out to write a retelling of the Arthurian legend from the female perspective, and in that she succeeded. She managed to put together a logical and a somewhat coherent version of the events that put King Arthur on his throne in Camelot and brought him down from it, and she managed to tell it with female voices. Igraine, Viviane, Morgaine, Gwenhwyfar, Morgause, all these women claw their way from the footnotes of the myth and become three dimensional people—not just characters, but people—with worries and joys of their own.Admittedly those joys were short-lived, but that’s partly why I loved the story. It’s why I love the legend as I do all things heart-rending.However, as wonderfully flawed all these people were with their virtues and their unbridled ambitions, none of them really had a choice in the matter. Ms. Bradley didn’t write people, women or men, who made the best of their unfortunate circumstances. She wrote people thrown about by the fates and whims of their deities. Morgaine’s last defence is that she never had a choice and that she was merely the Goddess’ instrument.And that’s why I hate this book.All the characters, as Ms. Bradley paints them, are passive. None are active. None make choices and then take responsibility for their actions. They’re all thrown into untenable situations where something must break and either give them that what they most wish or take it all away from them.Igraine marries because she doesn’t have a choice. She goes to convent, because she can’t bear to face the sister who forced her hand.Gwenhwyfar also marries, because she doesn’t have a choice. She first surrenders to her lover because she doesn’t have a choice. The only stupid choice she makes is so that the author has an excuse to make the pious lady into an adulteress without making herchooseit.Morgaine, the worst offender, chooses nothing. The closest she comes to making up her own mind is when she flees Avalon, but after that she promptly becomes the meekest of them all. She, who should be the fearsome Lady of the Lake and High Priestess of the Goddess, how can she be a vehicle of her Goddess’ will when she does nothing but allows others act around her?Catalyst, you say? This isn’t a chemical reaction where one substance remains unchanged. People change, people make choices that change them and others around them. Unless, of course, you’re a character inThe Mists of Avalon.But times were different then and women nothing but chattel, you say? There’s difference in being victimised and being a victim. All Morgaine and the others had to do to win me over, was not to see themselves as victims. All they had to do was to endure what was thrown at them and choose to make the best of it. All they had to do was to choose.Only Morgause and Viviane come close to choosing anything, and how are their choices rewarded? Why of course,theyare the great villainesses whose actions lead to a family tragedy after a family tragedy. Their actions bring an end to all those things they love and they don’t live to see the aftermath or acknowledge their responsibility.Telling a story from the female perspective doesn’t make it feminist; writing capable women doing things, being active, and making choices does. This book is something worse; it’s a pretender.There are many things I appreciate in this book, one thing I don’t is how it all was told. That matters. Dammit., error: Tę recenzję można znaleźć również na blogu Book Girl of Mur-y-Castell. Aktywnie czytam i recenzuję książki od półtora roku. W tym czasie moje kryteria oceniania książek w skali od jednej do pięciu gwiazdek zmieniały się kilka razy. Kilka rzeczy nadal jest aktualnych. Książka musi być wyjątkowa i pozostawić niezatarte wrażenie, abym przyznała jej pięć gwiazdek. Trzy gwiazdki to nadal moja ocena „meh”. To książka, którą obiektywnie mogę nazwać dobrą, coś, co mogłabym nawet przeczytać z przyjemnością, ale jest to też coś, o czym mogę łatwo zapomnieć i przejść dalej. Jednak moja ocena jednej gwiazdki zmieniła się najbardziej. Na początku było wszystko i wszystko, czego po prostu nie lubiłam. Gdyby przewinienia sumowały się do pewnego punktu, dałabym jej jedną gwiazdkę, bez względu na to, jakie odkupieńcze cechy bym w niej znalazła. Ale im więcej czytałam i faktycznie zaczęłam o tym myśleć, tym bardziej zdałam sobie sprawę, że są książki, które nie są nawet warte tej jednej gwiazdki, książki, które są dla mnie godne pogardy. Aby to zrekompensować, dostosowałam swoją osobistą skalę ocen i teraz jedna gwiazdka jest zarezerwowana dla książek, które wywołują we mnie płonącą białą wściekłość. Dałam dobre oceny książkom z postaciami, których nienawidziłam, gdy podobała mi się historia, i dałam dobre oceny książkom z historiami, których nienawidziłam, nawet gdy kochałam jedną lub dwie postacie. Dla mnie styl ma niewielkie znaczenie, ale cholera, ma znaczenie. I nie mówię o niezgrabnym języku, który w pewien sposób pasuje do tematu i legendy, ale trzeba się do niego przyzwyczaić. Pani Bradley postanowiła napisać opowieść o legendzie arturiańskiej z kobiecej perspektywy i w tym jej się udało. Udało jej się złożyć logiczną i w miarę spójną wersję wydarzeń, które umieściły króla Artura na tronie w Camelocie i strąciły go z niego, i udało jej się opowiedzieć to kobiecymi głosami. Igraine, Viviane, Morgaine, Gwenhwyfar, Morgause, wszystkie te kobiety wyrywają się z przypisów mitu i stają się trójwymiarowymi ludźmi — nie tylko postaciami, ale ludźmi — z własnymi troskami i radościami. Przyznaję, że te radości były krótkotrwałe, ale częściowo dlatego pokochałam tę historię. Dlatego kocham legendę tak samo jak wszystko, co rozdziera serce. Jednak, mimo że wszystkie te osoby były cudownie niedoskonałe ze swoimi cnotami i nieokiełznanymi ambicjami, żadna z nich tak naprawdę nie miała wyboru w tej sprawie. Pani Bradley nie pisała o ludziach, kobietach i mężczyznach, którzy jak najlepiej wykorzystali swoje nieszczęśliwe okoliczności. Pisała o ludziach rzuconych na głęboką wodę przez losy i kaprysy swoich bóstw. Ostatnią obroną Morgaine jest to, że nigdy nie miała wyboru i że była jedynie narzędziem Bogini. I dlatego nienawidzę tej książki. Wszystkie postacie, tak jak przedstawia je pani Bradley, są bierne. Żadna nie jest aktywna. Nikt nie dokonuje wyboru, a następnie nie bierze odpowiedzialności za swoje czyny. Wszyscy są wrzucani w nie do utrzymania sytuacje, w których coś musi się zepsuć i albo dać im to, czego najbardziej pragną, albo odebrać im to wszystko. Igraine wychodzi za mąż, ponieważ nie ma wyboru. Idzie do klasztoru, ponieważ nie może znieść spotkania z siostrą, która ją do tego zmusiła. Gwenifer również wychodzi za mąż, ponieważ nie ma wyboru. Najpierw poddaje się swojemu kochankowi, ponieważ nie ma wyboru. Jedyny głupi wybór, jakiego dokonuje, to taki, aby autor miał wymówkę, by uczynić pobożną damę cudzołożnicą, nie zmuszając jej do wyboru. Morgiana, najgorsza przestępca, niczego nie wybiera. Najbliżej podjęcia decyzji jest, gdy ucieka z Avalonu, ale potem natychmiast staje się najłagodniejszą ze wszystkich. Ona, która powinna być przerażającą Panią Jeziora i Najwyższą Kapłanką Bogini, jak może być narzędziem woli swojej Bogini, skoro nie robi nic poza pozwalaniem innym działać wokół siebie?Katalizator, mówisz? To nie jest reakcja chemiczna, w której jedna substancja pozostaje niezmienna. Ludzie się zmieniają, ludzie podejmują wybory, które zmieniają ich i innych wokół nich. Chyba że jesteś postacią z Mgieł Avalonu.Ale wtedy czasy były inne, a kobiety były niczym więcej niż majątkiem, mówisz? Jest różnica między byciem ofiarą a byciem ofiarą. Wszystko, co Morgaine i inni musieli zrobić, aby mnie zdobyć, to nie postrzegać siebie jako ofiar. Wszystko, co musieli zrobić, to znieść to, co na nich rzucono, i wybrać, aby jak najlepiej to wykorzystać. Wszystko, co musieli zrobić, to wybrać.Tylko Morgause i Viviane są bliskie wybrania czegokolwiek, a jak ich wybory są nagradzane? Oczywiście, że są wielkimi złoczyńcami, których działania prowadzą do rodzinnej tragedii po rodzinnej tragedii. Ich działania kończą wszystko, co kochają, a one nie dożywają, by zobaczyć skutki lub przyznać się do swojej odpowiedzialności. Opowiadanie historii z kobiecej perspektywy nie czyni jej feministyczną; pisanie o zdolnych kobietach robiących rzeczy, będących aktywnymi i podejmujących wybory tak. Ta książka jest czymś gorszym; to udawanie. Jest wiele rzeczy, które doceniam w tej książce, jedną rzeczą, której nie doceniam, jest to, jak to wszystko zostało opowiedziane. To ma znaczenie.

            "Translation failed for: welcome to...OCTOBER TWIST.this isproject long classics, in which i read intimidating books over a whole month and my little treat is i get to come up with a title + time-based pun as i do so.charles dickens books are some of the scariest of all, so only a truly irresistible (read: terrible) pun could convince me.this has 53 chapters (ugh, it's almost like dickens didn't think about a 26 year old annoying person centuries in the future trying to divide evenly), so i'll read 2-ish per day.CHAPTER 1: TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTHwhy does this chapter title seem like dickens was immediately worried about hitting word count.in this we establish that oliver twist's circumstances have been miserable from birth, other than the fact that his mom was hot.CHAPTER 2: TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARDthere are little to no treats involved in either of these chapters, in case you were wondering. mostly just a lot of sarcastic comments about social issues in england.please sir i want some more alert!CHAPTER 3: REVEALS HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE, WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECUREsometimes if you really, really don't want to do something, such as homework or being indentured to a chimney sweep, you can just cry a lot and hope to be too annoying to deal with.CHAPTER 4: OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFEwould you rather be a coffin-maker or a chimney sweep? vibes are worse for a coffin-maker but i feel like the day-to-day is probably more chill than trying to dislodge ash or whatever.CHAPTER 5: OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVORABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER'S BUSINESShow much do you want to bet the titular new associates are, like, rats or spiders or something to display just how miserable oliver's life is.ah, no. it was just a mean guy i think.CHAPTER 6: OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIMthis chapter is only a few pages long and basically covers what the title does (and just slightly more verbosely).CHAPTER 7: OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORYi feel like if i was a kid and i said to my friend \"ok pal see you later, hope you're doing good\" and they responded like \"surely i won't do well by any means until the good lord sees it fit to call me back...for this world is cruel and punishing, and my suffering seems to abound...\" i'd need to end that friendship.CHAPTER 8: OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMANi love a good walk as much as the next person but 65 miles in the winter with only a crust of bread seems a bit much.CHAPTER 9: CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILSi just know adjectives hate to see charles dickens coming. anyway it appears oliver is on the cusp of joining london's old timey bling ring.CHAPTER 10: OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN THIS HISTORYyou're kidding me with this. now we're vouching for the quality of the chapters in their titles? this isn't even the shortest chapter so far. what are we doing here.oliver just got bashed in the head (normal) and arrested for robbery (exceptional). you didn't have to tell me that the first entry on his felony record was \"very important,\" chuck.CHAPTER 11: TREATS OF MR. FANG, THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICEinsane to name a bad guy \"mr fang.\" i'm going to write a work of classic literature and name the villain \"sir things-that-are-bad.\"CHAPTER 12: IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDSnow oliver has been rescued by the man his colleagues robbed and spends his days laying bed and hanging out in the company of nice old ladies. otherwise known as the american dream.CHAPTER 13: SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER; CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORYmaybe i wouldn't complain so much about these chapter titles if all of them contained nice little compliments to me.ok it appears this one was meant to be sarcastic. so never mind.CHAPTER 14: COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER'S STAY AT MR BROWNLOW'S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR GRIMWIG OFFERED CONCERNING HIM WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRANDokay. i get that oliver's life has been really hard. and far be it from me to be unsympathetic to a literary character (something i dabble in approximately every day of my life)...but this kid cries too damn much.CHAPTER 15: SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WEREslang used to be so much more fun and less coherent. ah yes, of course, \"jerk the tinkler\" meaning \"ring the bell.\" why didn't you say so.CHAPTER 16: RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCYclearly i am not the sweetest kindest largest-hearted reader in the world, but i'll get this on the record anyway: a book being as sad / tortuous as possible does not equal a plot to me.CHAPTER 17: OLIVER'S DESTINY, CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATIONseems like dickens didn't heed my last-chapter warning. this is just all religious children begging for god to grant them mercy in the form of a swift death and innocent children being anecdotally convicted of social crimes.CHAPTER 18: HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDSnothing scarier to charles dickens than a noun without a nearby adjective. anyway nothing happens in this chapter.CHAPTER 19: IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ONit basically goes without saying (check out some of these chapter titles!), but on top of this book being very boring and emotionally one-note so far, it's also wildly anti-semitic.CHAPTER 20: WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKESoliver is getting re-kidnapped in the dead of night to another criminal circuit's house and then they're arriving only to eat supper? i guess they dine at midnight like the spanish. how elegant.CHAPTER 21: THE EXPEDITIONwhoa. this one is so...normal. concise, even.i mean, not the chapter itself, which is an 8-page rendition of what amounts to a commute, but its title.CHAPTER 22: THE BURGLARYwow. a whole day of just typing out the titles without having to check against the page 11 times to make sure i'm correct. charles, you spoil me.CHAPTER 23: WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTSuh huh, yes, very clever, people being cartoonishly evil about poor people again. i get you. (i hate this book right now.)CHAPTER 24: TREATS OF A VERY POOR SUBJECT. BUT IS A SHORT ONE; AND MAY BE FOUND OF SOME IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORYin this chapter, an old lady on her deathbed confesses that she stole gold from oliver's mother as she died and that if she hadn't stolen it the mom would have lived and/or oliver would have at least been treated more kindly.i thought the point of this book was that poverty is unjust and poor people are people too, but it seems like i may have been giving charles too much credit. it's more about one (1) unlucky kid.CHAPTER 25: WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REFERS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANYi have to tell you, i began this book feeling a little bit daunted but overall neutral and every day since i have grown to dislike it more and more. can't wait to see what new evil surprises today has in store.CHAPTER 26: IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMEDit's pissing me off so much that every chapter is charles dickens being like \"and by the way, this is relevant to the story.\" THIS IS THE STORY. THE WAY WE SPEND OUR DAYS IS THE WAY WE SPEND OUR LIVES, CHARLES.CHAPTER 27: ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLYtwo of the people who hate poor people are getting married and another two of the people who hate poor people have been hooking up. we're more than halfway through now and this is as close to a plot as we've gotten.CHAPTER 28: LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURESwe last saw the fellow, i'm pretty sure, as a broken body in a ditch after a robbery gone wrong, which i didn't mention because i'm so annoyed at the whole thing and i guess held out hope oliver had been put out of his misery and so too had we and the 300 remaining pages were just footnotes or something.CHAPTER 29: HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTEDi was in such a good mood today, just vibing along with myother painful long classics projectand myfour non-project current reads, and remembering i hadn't done my daily chapters of oliver twist hit me like a cannonball. no one could be more miserable than me right now. and i'm counting oliver.CHAPTER 30: RELATES WHAT OLIVER'S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIManyways, temporary reprieve from my bemoaning my fate to get back to the plot, such as it is: oliver is roommates now with the people he tried to rob.CHAPTER 31: INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITIONmuch like the one i'm taking on this book. buh dum ch.CHAPTER 32: OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDSi bet this one will last a while. surely no tragedy related to poverty and/or crime will befall oliver this time.CHAPTER 33: WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECKcan't make this stuff up. the happiness in question lasted exactly one (1) chapter. what are we doing here.CHAPTER 34: CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVERok so oliver is actually still roommates with the people he tried to rob, but it seems like that is coming to a swift end? i don't know. the bummer of the last chapter was a girl got sick and almost died but didn't, which is actually paradise compared to the other plot points here so who knows.CHAPTER 35: CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER'S ADVENTURE; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSEwell, it appears we're most likely about 1-2 chapters and a handful of slurs away from oliver getting re-kidnapped. shock of the century. but i guess i'm supposed to care that oliver's sick roommate is turning down a proposal from some guy who just showed up?CHAPTER 36: IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE. BUT IT SHOULD BE READ, NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVESdoes charles dickens think i'm reading these chapters in whatever order occurs to me? just throwing a bunch of pages in the air and reading whatever words i catch as they fall back down? good lord. so unnecessary.CHAPTER 37: IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASESwe've spent 13 pages on the unhappy marriage between the two aforementioned poor-haters and 2 on a mysterious figure who will surely be of actual relevance to the plot. perfect.CHAPTER 38: CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR AND MRS BUMBLE, AND MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW20 pages to retell a story we've heard before (oliver's dead mom's stolen locket) and throw it in the river.CHAPTER 39: INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHERthis shouldn't even be called \"oliver twist.\" RANDOM GROUPS OF PEOPLE DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING INTERESTING would be a way more apt title.CHAPTER 40: A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAPTERplease do not even get me started with \"a sequel to the last chapter.\"now nancy (oliver's girl roommate with the bad guys) and rose (oliver's girl roommate with the good guys) are talking about monks (the mysterious and plot-critical guy who we ignored completely in favor of irrelevant marital strife earlier) and his scheme to hide oliver's true identity (because he actually isn't poor, rendering any theme or point this book accidentally stumbled upon moot). also making a plan to be future roommates.CHAPTER 41: CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SURPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONEwhy does oliver know how to read and write? did i miss a good will hunting-style prodigy sequence somewhere between the various kidnappings?anyway. he's been reunited with a prior set of roommates, one of whom (elderly) kissed the good girl roommate for (truly) (no exaggeration) no reason (and then was like, you're not allowed to be upset, i'm old).CHAPTER 42: AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER'S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS, BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLISso, to recap: oliver was born in a midwife's house, and then sent to a poorhouse, and then sent to a workhouse, and then sent to be a chimney sweep, and then walked to london where he ended up at the thieves' house, and then went to good guys' house #1, and was then kidnapped back to the thieves, and then was kidnapped to different thieves, and then was made to rob good guys' house #2 where he ended up living.i mean good lord.CHAPTER 43: WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLEtrouble? but how! his name is the artful dodger! surely he could've nimbly avoided it at the last moment!we can only hope he escapes from prison, both because then he'd regain his reputation and because we'd be able to finish this book saying something happened.CHAPTER 44: THE TIME ARRIVES FOR ROSE MAYLIE TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO NANCY. SHE FAILSthis is rose maylie libel. she's not even present in this chapter. her only crime remains being boring.CHAPTER 45: NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSIONnothing much actually happens in this chapter, other than making me crave buttered toast.CHAPTER 46: THE APPOINTMENT KEPTno one has ever been destined to die like nancy. dark bad past, wants to redeem herself, unloved in the world, keeps talking about bad omens. charles dickens is going to kill her off in a misguided redemption arc / attempt at emotional investment and neither will work on me.CHAPTER 47: FATAL CONSEQUENCESit actually feels so good to be proven right immediately. to make a prediction in one chapter that comes true the next...pure bliss.CHAPTER 48: THE FLIGHT OF SIKESenough bragging about how amazing i am at trope-filled centuries-old books. i'll catch you up. basically, sikes, who has some sort of romantic but evil but paternal role in nancy's life preventing her from Becoming Good, just heard from fagin who heard from noah claypole that nancy snitched and, for lack of a better term, murdered the sh*t out of her.CHAPTER 49: MONKS AND MR BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IThow many characters referred to exclusively by a last name that literally no actual human has ever had can i genuinely be expected to keep track of?this chapter is like the inverse of a villain's monologue explaining his evil vision at the end of a movie: a good guy is info-dumping various scraps of backstory that vaguely connect all of these people. this, i assume, is what this book has instead of a \"plot.\"CHAPTER 50: THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPEthe titular escape is a reference to an accidental hanging. like, a guy randomly puts a noose around his neck, which just so happens to be tied to a chimney, and then without intention falls off a roof. i've said it before and i'll say it again: what are we doing here.CHAPTER 51: AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE, WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN MONEYthis whole sequence has been spent introducing and tying up a series of loose ends for no comprehensible reason other than story extension to make me miserable, specifically. oliver had his happily ever after 19 chapters ago, and in spite of my sarcastic predictions, that has not been messed with at all. nothing has changed since then. but oh, great, rose and oliver are rich siblings instead of poor orphans.this book is driving me insane.CHAPTER 52: THE JEW'S LAST NIGHT ALIVEoh, great. we get to spend our penultimate day enacting charles dickens's blood justice fantasies. at least i got an excuse to say penultimate. great word.CHAPTER 53: AND LASTrose and harry got married (i never even told you who harry is — that's how little he matters); rose's mother figure moves in with them (sure); monks takes his half of his fortune, moves to america, and dies in prison (what a happily ever after); oliver gets adopted by one of his groups of roommates (and i'm not joking: it's not the one he's spent the last 21 chapters with); noah claypole (heretofore only referenced as a hater of the poor) becomes a professional snitch; the married poor haters become poor; two people i don't remember keep doing what they were doing; and one of the child thieves becomes a good guy.extending this book by even 5 pages to give me these updates is adding insult to injury.OVERALLi've said to many people this month that i hate this book and i can't wait to give it one star. that's a little bit of an exaggeration. i disliked it extremely and am giving it 2.this is only my third dickens, but it's less funny, less coherent, less thematically consistent, and less emotionally impactful than the other two. but catch me right back here reading through all his others.rating: 2, error: welcome to...OCTOBER TWIST.this isproject long classics, in which i read intimidating books over a whole month and my little treat is i get to come up with a title + time-based pun as i do so.charles dickens books are some of the scariest of all, so only a truly irresistible (read: terrible) pun could convince me.this has 53 chapters (ugh, it's almost like dickens didn't think about a 26 year old annoying person centuries in the future trying to divide evenly), so i'll read 2-ish per day.CHAPTER 1: TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTHwhy does this chapter title seem like dickens was immediately worried about hitting word count.in this we establish that oliver twist's circumstances have been miserable from birth, other than the fact that his mom was hot.CHAPTER 2: TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARDthere are little to no treats involved in either of these chapters, in case you were wondering. mostly just a lot of sarcastic comments about social issues in england.please sir i want some more alert!CHAPTER 3: REVEALS HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE, WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECUREsometimes if you really, really don't want to do something, such as homework or being indentured to a chimney sweep, you can just cry a lot and hope to be too annoying to deal with.CHAPTER 4: OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFEwould you rather be a coffin-maker or a chimney sweep? vibes are worse for a coffin-maker but i feel like the day-to-day is probably more chill than trying to dislodge ash or whatever.CHAPTER 5: OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVORABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER'S BUSINESShow much do you want to bet the titular new associates are, like, rats or spiders or something to display just how miserable oliver's life is.ah, no. it was just a mean guy i think.CHAPTER 6: OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIMthis chapter is only a few pages long and basically covers what the title does (and just slightly more verbosely).CHAPTER 7: OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORYi feel like if i was a kid and i said to my friend \"ok pal see you later, hope you're doing good\" and they responded like \"surely i won't do well by any means until the good lord sees it fit to call me back...for this world is cruel and punishing, and my suffering seems to abound...\" i'd need to end that friendship.CHAPTER 8: OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON.

SHE FAILSthis is rose maylie libel. she's not even present in this chapter. her only crime remains being boring.CHAPTER 45: NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSIONnothing much actually happens in this chapter, other than making me crave buttered toast.CHAPTER 46: THE APPOINTMENT KEPTno one has ever been destined to die like nancy. dark bad past, wants to redeem herself, unloved in the world, keeps talking about bad omens. charles dickens is going to kill her off in a misguided redemption arc / attempt at emotional investment and neither will work on me.CHAPTER 47: FATAL CONSEQUENCESit actually feels so good to be proven right immediately. to make a prediction in one chapter that comes true the next...pure bliss.CHAPTER 48: THE FLIGHT OF SIKESenough bragging about how amazing i am at trope-filled centuries-old books. i'll catch you up. basically, sikes, who has some sort of romantic but evil but paternal role in nancy's life preventing her from Becoming Good, just heard from fagin who heard from noah claypole that nancy snitched and, for lack of a better term, murdered the sh*t out of her.CHAPTER 49: MONKS AND MR BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IThow many characters referred to exclusively by a last name that literally no actual human has ever had can i genuinely be expected to keep track of?this chapter is like the inverse of a villain's monologue explaining his evil vision at the end of a movie: a good guy is info-dumping various scraps of backstory that vaguely connect all of these people. this, i assume, is what this book has instead of a \"plot.\"CHAPTER 50: THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPEthe titular escape is a reference to an accidental hanging. like, a guy randomly puts a noose around his neck, which just so happens to be tied to a chimney, and then without intention falls off a roof. i've said it before and i'll say it again: what are we doing here.CHAPTER 51: AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE, WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN MONEYthis whole sequence has been spent introducing and tying up a series of loose ends for no comprehensible reason other than story extension to make me miserable, specifically. oliver had his happily ever after 19 chapters ago, and in spite of my sarcastic predictions, that has not been messed with at all. nothing has changed since then. but oh, great, rose and oliver are rich siblings instead of poor orphans.this book is driving me insane.CHAPTER 52: THE JEW'S LAST NIGHT ALIVEoh, great. we get to spend our penultimate day enacting charles dickens's blood justice fantasies. at least i got an excuse to say penultimate. great word.CHAPTER 53: AND LASTrose and harry got married (i never even told you who harry is — that's how little he matters); rose's mother figure moves in with them (sure); monks takes his half of his fortune, moves to america, and dies in prison (what a happily ever after); oliver gets adopted by one of his groups of roommates (and i'm not joking: it's not the one he's spent the last 21 chapters with); noah claypole (heretofore only referenced as a hater of the poor) becomes a professional snitch; the married poor haters become poor; two people i don't remember keep doing what they were doing; and one of the child thieves becomes a good guy.extending this book by even 5 pages to give me these updates is adding insult to injury.OVERALLi've said to many people this month that i hate this book and i can't wait to give it one star. that's a little bit of an exaggeration. i disliked it extremely and am giving it 2.this is only my third dickens, but it's less funny, less coherent, less thematically consistent, and less emotionally impactful than the other two. but catch me right back here reading through all his others.rating: 2 --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

I know, I know, my review of this isn't really needed, everybody's talking about this book, everybody's got the general gist of what it's about. But I've spent quite a long time thinking about this novel, the characters, and the relationship portrayed. I've been thinking about all the reasons people hate this so much and love it so much. I need to confess - for those who missed it - that I originally reviewed this first book immediately after finishing it and before I started (and finished) the other two books in the trilogy. I gave it three stars, I expressed all thatFifty Shades of Greyhad made me feel: annoyed, frustrated, confused, and also entertained. I have since then felt like I have much more to add.The reason I personally think that opinions differ so greatly on these novels is not because people have different sexual tastes. For some, yeah, this will come into play. However, I think the main reason is that this book and the characters send out a confusing mix of messages. When I finishedFifty Shades of Grey, I had no idea what kind of book I'd just read. Was it BDSM erotica? Or the tale of a man's childhood abuse and how this impacted on his sex life later on? Were Christian Grey's sexual tastes supposed to be erotic or wrong? Let me tell those of you who haven't read this: it isn't clear.This book appears to be an erotic BDSM romance at face value. But Ana makes it clear early on that she doesn't want that kind of relationship, that Christian is \"fifty shades of fucked up\", that the way he behaves isn't right, but is actually the result of an abusive upbringing. Ana later contradicts her early decision and gets all pouty when Christian won't play kinky with her... and yet the previous time he'd done it she spent the evening crying and feeling sorry for herself. Some people seem to see Christian as the big bad man who abuses a weak young woman. This is not the case. There is nothing, I repeatnothing, that happens between the two of them that Ana doesn't give consent to. Sure, she may whine about it afterwards, or use the excuse that she doesn't want to lose him, but she makes the choices, she holds the power.Here's what I think is the ultimate problem withFifty Shades of Grey: Ms James' terrible writing. It's nothing new, she even admitted it herself, but that is why we all can't figure out what it is about this book that makes it some parts entertaining, some parts annoying as fuck. Because I'm trying to categorise this so I can begin to understand it, so that I can form my opinion and write my review accordingly. But we cannot understand what doesn't make sense. And James' characterisation does not make any sense at all. She writes Ana as a naive student at the mercy of Christian's abusive past, then she writes Ana as a sexual manipulator who actually likes BDSM. Is Christian sexy or a victim? I'll tell you: he's both and neither, because James cannot create characters and relationships to save her life. She contradicts herself, she changes her mind without logical reason. This is why it is pointless analysing the relationship between Ana and Christian. One minute it's sexy, the next minute it's fucked up. One minute it's BDSM, the next minute it's abuse. How do you accurately review a book that changes its mind every two minutes?I also feel I need to say something about BDSM. Any more than a small amount of kinky doesn't really interest me, but it doesn't bother me either if it is between consenting adults. However, there are two things I can say about this matter inFifty Shades of Grey: 1) it really isn'tthatkinky, and 2) for the most part, this isn't really a BDSM relationship (I don't think the author actually understands what one is). I can't say that I'm experienced in visitingthose kindof clubs down the dark allies of Soho, but I've done not a small amount of reading on the psychological aspect of BDSM relationships. I have a keen interest in feminism and I have often wondered if something like this is nothing but a hindrance to the progress of women and equality. I would conclude from my reading that it is not.Firstly, BDSM relationships are about give and take. The dom and the sub each give one another what they want/need. It isn't about abuse, it isn't about selfishly taking what you want, and because these relationships involve relinquishing control to another person, there is a deep amount of trust required. Also, it is important to note that the power of the dom is an illusion, the sub holds all the power, they say how far it goes, when it stops, what is too much. The key thing is thatboth of them get something out of it. Which is why the relationship inFifty Shades of Greycan only be called BDSM when Ana does an abrupt u-turn on her opinions and decides she wants a bit of spankiness. The parts where she is upset about the relationship Christian wants - that is not BDSM. The parts where she reluctantly allows him to get his way - that is not BDSM.I think there is nothing wrong with BDSM erotica. I think there is nothing wrong with doms, subs, sex slaves, whatever... if that is what the person wants. ButFifty Shades of Greyis about 10% BDSM relationship and 90% bad writing that just fucks with your head until you're not sure what the hell you're reading. Ms James has created one mess of a book, whether you'll look at her mess and see something entertaining or horrific, well that's kinda just like looking at this picture and asking whether you see a rabbit or a duck., error: I have finally made a decision aboutFifty Shades of Grey.

            "Translation failed for: You know, sometimes I just don’t get other readers. I can’t relate to their reactions, their expectations, their way of looking at things. TakeBeloved, a book that I have only ever part read, having given up about a third of the way into it. Reaction to the book seems to be about evenly split between those who hate it and those who love it. Which is fine, of course. Yet the haters appear to base their antipathy on the subject matter; they, according to the reviews I’ve read, have a problem with someone writing about slavery; they compose their reviews metaphorically throwing their hands around in wild fashion as if to keep this objectionable topic away. It’s as though Morrison was trying to convert them to Catholicism or something. I can’t get my head around it at all. Their argument, as far as I can gather, is that slavery was, y’know, a long time ago and we’re now entirely inclusive and lovely towards all people and so writing about slavery is tantamount to trying to make us [by which I mean white people] feel guilty for something that 1. we didn’t ourselves do and 2. we can’t control i.e. the colour of our skin. Honestly, go look around the web [including this site]; I’m not making this shit up.What do you say to ignorant crap like that? Part of me would prefer to say nothing because I find it exhausting arguing against such obvious idiocy. But if I was forced to respond I might well state, first of all, that, uh, racismdoesactually still exist. And so the subject is, er, not entirely irrelevant. Secondly, even if it didn’t exist in our society, even if we were all living in multi-cultural hippy communes, what exactly would be wrong with someone writing about slavery and persecution? I might be wrong of course [I’m not], but I’m pretty sure Morrison didn’t put the necessary effort and time into writing a book just to make some twat in Milton Keynes feel guilty. If you ask me, I’d guess that it may be that, as a black woman, as a human being, she would be interested in exploring and understanding such a pivotal and lamentable part of [her/our] history.For me, the point of writing a book likeBelovedis to elevate a terrible part of history beyond mere statistics. Like with the holocaust, it’s easy sometimes to get lost in numbers, to forget that individual people were affected or perished.Belovedpersonalises slavery, which makes it easier for people-in-general to identify with the subject. I would say that is very important. As far as I’m concerned, we should not be allowed to forget, to push these things under the carpet. You cannot live in a vacuum, where history is meaningless except for passing exams and making a HBO mini-series. This stuff is part of who you are and continues to play a role in how the world, your world, works. And, yeah, I know what people say, which is that there are plenty of tragedies not given the same status, or attention; these people ask, why aren’t we talking about what happened in Bosnia, Serbia, Nigeria, etc? My response: stop whinging and write a book about those places/conflicts/tragedies, then.However, I did, of course, quitBelovedwithout finishing it, although my doing so, my quitting, obviously had nothing to do with white guilt; my issues with the novel aren’t political ones, but, rather, they are bookish ones. I didn’t feel as though Toni Morrison was preaching at me, but I did feel as though the book was too heavy-handed and overwrought, and even cringingly trite and saccharine. In fact, the thing struck me as something like what Faulkner might have produced had you plied him full of E and asked him to write a chick-lit novel.Just consider this line:\"Jump, if you want to, ‘cause I’ll catch you, girl. I’ll catch you ‘fore you fall.\"And this:\"He leans over and takes her hand. With the other he touches her face. ‘You your best thing, Sethe. You are.’ His holding fingers are holding hers.\"The most polite thing I can say about those two quotes is that neither strike me as good writing.What about this:\"In this here place, we flesh; flesh that weeps, laughs; flesh that dances on bare feet in grass. Love it. Love it hard. Yonder they do not love your flesh. They despise it. They don’t love your eyes; they’d just as soon pick em out. No more do they love the skin on your back. Yonder they flay it. And O my people they do not love your hands. Those they only use, tie, bind, chop off and leave empty. Love your hands! Love them. Raise them up and kiss them. Touch others with them, pat them together, stroke them on your face ’cause they don’t love that either. You got to love it, you! And no, they ain’t in love with your mouth. Yonder, out there, they will see it broken and break it again. What you say out of it they will not heed. What you scream from it they do not hear. What you put into it to nourish your body they will snatch away and give you leavins instead. No, they don’t love your mouth. You got to love it. This is flesh I’m talking about here. Flesh that needs to be loved.\"I mean….dear God. And the thing is, I totally agree with the sentiment of almost everything in the above passage; it’s the presentation of that sentiment that bothers me.Every sentence inBelovedaches [or creaks] with emotion, with meaning and significance; and, for me, the impact of the story, and the full horror of the subject that Morrison was dealing with, was compromised by that. Cards on the table, I found the book entirely ridiculous. Throughout my reading, I wanted on almost every page to tell her: tone it down, and let the story breathe a bit; I wanted to chide her: you’re trying too hard. I felt as though some of her choices weren’t made in order to serve the story, but because she was trying to impress. Ironically, for someone who, I think I am correct in saying, teaches or taught English literature or creative writing, I would say that she needed advice and guidance herself. Someone needed to look at the manuscript and take a red pen to it, with little notes in the margin saying 'is this necessary?'What is strange aboutBelovedis that it is both saccharineandbrutal. There’s a weird tension between the florid style, the sentimentality, and the subject matter and some of the content; it is a book that screams excess; everything is taken just a bit too far; Morrison displays a distinct inability to rein in it, and a lack of subtlety and control. So, one minute we’re getting told about how breast milk was forcibly harvested from Sethe, the next she and Paul D are sharing a tender moment, as he feels up the scars on her back and rambles on poetically-symbolically about a tree.Probably the most glaring misstep in the novel occurs long after I gave up on it. Struggling badly to overcome my reservations about the quality of what I was reading, I had a look at some online reviews. It was then that I came across the opinions outlined in my initial paragraphs, but it was also then that I found out that the baby – the ghost baby, the slaughtered baby – at some point in the novel is apparently heard in the text; by which I mean that we have access to its thoughts or words. And, I, ah, I dunno about you, but that just seems ludicrous to me; it’s almost akin to gross incompetence or mishandling of your material. Why on earth would you do that? The fate of that child speaks loudly enough, all Toni Morrison is doing by giving it a voice [a stream of consciousness voice, I believe] is cranking up the melodrama to 1000. And I had a thought upon that discovery, a thought that ran: I’m not reading allthisto getthere., error: You know, sometimes I just don’t get other readers.

And the thing is, I totally agree with the sentiment of almost everything in the above passage; it’s the presentation of that sentiment that bothers me.Every sentence inBelovedaches [or creaks] with emotion, with meaning and significance; and, for me, the impact of the story, and the full horror of the subject that Morrison was dealing with, was compromised by that. Cards on the table, I found the book entirely ridiculous. Throughout my reading, I wanted on almost every page to tell her: tone it down, and let the story breathe a bit; I wanted to chide her: you’re trying too hard. I felt as though some of her choices weren’t made in order to serve the story, but because she was trying to impress. Ironically, for someone who, I think I am correct in saying, teaches or taught English literature or creative writing, I would say that she needed advice and guidance herself. Someone needed to look at the manuscript and take a red pen to it, with little notes in the margin saying 'is this necessary?'What is strange aboutBelovedis that it is both saccharineandbrutal. There’s a weird tension between the florid style, the sentimentality, and the subject matter and some of the content; it is a book that screams excess; everything is taken just a bit too far; Morrison displays a distinct inability to rein in it, and a lack of subtlety and control. So, one minute we’re getting told about how breast milk was forcibly harvested from Sethe, the next she and Paul D are sharing a tender moment, as he feels up the scars on her back and rambles on poetically-symbolically about a tree.Probably the most glaring misstep in the novel occurs long after I gave up on it. Struggling badly to overcome my reservations about the quality of what I was reading, I had a look at some online reviews. It was then that I came across the opinions outlined in my initial paragraphs, but it was also then that I found out that the baby – the ghost baby, the slaughtered baby – at some point in the novel is apparently heard in the text; by which I mean that we have access to its thoughts or words. And, I, ah, I dunno about you, but that just seems ludicrous to me; it’s almost akin to gross incompetence or mishandling of your material. Why on earth would you do that? The fate of that child speaks loudly enough, all Toni Morrison is doing by giving it a voice [a stream of consciousness voice, I believe] is cranking up the melodrama to 1000. And I had a thought upon that discovery, a thought that ran: I’m not reading allthisto getthere. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

Be warned I’m quite angry because I keep reading your books for some bizarre reason and I cringe and tear my hair out in despair.

            "Translation failed for: “I guess that’s the point of it all. No one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people. Oftentimes, we have no clue. Yet we push it just the same.”It felt wrong to dislike this book, given its subject and what it’s trying to say. A teenage girl commits suicide and, through the tapes recorded prior to it, tries to explain why, tries to have us see herself, tries to show how even insignificant events can start snowballing until it’s too late and you are looking for a permanent way out. She tries to tell us that we should care enough to see what someone is going through and maybe - by caring enough - to be the one that can make the snowballing effect stop. She tries to show that it doesn’t have to be a grand event pushing you over the edge but a combination of continuing small quantities of shittiness of life that can become a burden too much to bear.I see it. I understand it. I agree.But I really dislike *how* it was done.Because Hannah is so painfully selfish and melodramatically self-absorbed, and her actions with sending her tapes to those that she blames for her suicide and requiring for those to be passed on or else are quite awful and are bound to become an extra thing that just may cause the same snowballing effect in the lives of those that she’s taking revenge on with her tapes. Because let’s be honest - these tapes do seem like her way of hitting back, and not considering the consequences for others, after she is gone.“When you reach the end of these tapes, […] I hope you’ll understand your role in all of this. Because it may seem like a small role now, but it matters. In the end, everything matters.”She knows very well about the snowballing that even the smallest, most insignificant things can have on a person who is reaching the end of their endurance with life. And she does not really know what’s going on in the lives of those who will receive her tapes. Those who will be told - you are the one to blame for a suicide. Those who are disproportionally told - the responsibility is yours to bear for one careless act or gesture. Those who will be told -I was in the room when you were raped and didn’t stop it, and it made *me* feel bad- without even considering what it can do to the person who it was done to and who is now listening to the tapes and knows that so did - or will - several others who may be able to identify her no matter if she wants it or not. Hannah wants everyone to be wracked with guilt for something they could not foresee (a freshman kid making an idiotic “Hot or Not” list where he put Hannah on the “hot” side and the girl she goes on to vilify on the “Not” side is dumb, but blaming him for your suicide is awful as well;a popular girl upsets Hannah by not caring about the possibility of budding friendship and acts fake - enough for Hannah to add the shallow teen behavior as one of the reasons for suicide and apportion blame there as well;a girl who drove drunk (while actually showing caring towards Hannah), destroyed a Stop sign that caused a deadly accident later - Hannah blames her and her act for her subsequent suicide, adding that extra guilt to what Jenny probably was already struggling with-because more guilt apparently is a solution when it comes to Hannah apportioning blame as Hannah is laser-focused on herself and herself only). She does not know or care if her tapes will be the last straw for anyone listening to them.She does not care at all.And honestly, given Hannah’s state of mind, if the people she blames for her impending suicide haven’t done the things they did, I’m sure Hannah would have found something else that would have affected her the same way. She was spiraling down, and it seems almost anything would have pushed her deeper and deeper into the state from where there was no escape. Yet she prefers to single out a few people to lay blame on, and most of them do not deserve that, but the blame has been already doled out and witnesses made.Misery loves company, and Hannah relentlessly soldiers on, blaming others for small and petty and mean things that snowballed for her and led to her suicide.And she knows where it can lead, and does not care.She’s going down but is determinedly taking those who slighted her with her. She wants to *really* touch their lives - and let’s hope that they find a way to deal with it that is different from the path Hannah took.“You don’t know what went on in the rest of my life. At home. Even at school. You don’t know what goes on in anyone’s life but your own. And when you mess with one part of a person’s life, you’re not messing with just that part. Unfortunately, you can’t be that precise and selective. When you mess with one part of a person’s life, you’re messing with their entire life.”I would have appreciated this book more if the set up was different. Not the revenge tapes that she makes sure reach the intended audience, but just a narration of a girl who is depressed and driven to commit suicide by the combined snowballing shittiness of life. It could have been poignant and shattering instead of frustration at her callously and vengefully deciding to upend the lives of those who were just a bit mean to her, by her own admission “messing with their entire life” so that they can be sorry for what they did.I feel for Hannah but I abhor her selfishness and callousness and the way the story seems to condone apportioning blame to everyone around her, leaving them with the burden of guilt, mostly undeserved.I dislike how he author chose to frame the story and the implications of those choices. Suicide framed as revenge is not good.A story of suicide told through vindictive finger-pointing pettiness cheapens the intended emotional effect.So instead of touched I’m irritated and frustrated and a bit exasperated.2 stars., error: “I guess that’s the point of it all.

            "Translation failed for: Day late and a dollar short with this one.My hope was to have read and reviewedHis Dark Materialstrilogy before the film adaptation of the first third,The Golden Compass, came out last Friday. And I would have too - if it weren't for that sheer enormity of suckiness that was the third book in the series (The Amber Spyglass). *sigh* But then, life doesn't actually work out perfectly for us as often as we'd like. Sometimes there are earthquakes that level cities in Turkey. Sometimes Spinach is found to test positive for Salmonella. Sometimes a country introduces democracy to another. And sometimes, just sometimes, Philip Pullman writes a book.Now I don't want it to sound like the series is the worst ever written. It's not. It's not even the worst I've ever read. Not entirely anyway. The fact is there are three books and they should be treated separately before we get to the series as a whole. So then, to the review! (times three.)Oh yeah. And there'll be some spoilers in there. Not that it matters. Seriously.________________The Golden CompassA third of the way into Pullman's first installment ofHis Dark Materials, I was excited. While Pullman wasn't the most eloquent of writers and his characters had yet to really develop at all, it was clear he had an exciting imagination and was as good at world-building as nearly any fantasy author. He had developed an alternate history for our world that while completely foreign was largely analogous to our own that it didn't seem like a different world entirely. They have science and electricity and particle physics and everything - they just call it by a different name.The real joy and conceit of the series though is Pullman's use of daemons, animal expressions of every character's soul. These familiars are constant companions of every human, expressing through their animal nature the nature and quality of their human companion. And the daemons of children have yet to find a stabilized form and so flit forth and back and over and again through a host of forms - from owl to ermine to tabby to dolphin to moth to monkey. Et cetera.Throughout the first book's clumsy storytelling, there is still something that approaches near to wonder. Enough to satisfy some readers. The first four-fifths of the narrative are brisk and enjoyable, and the book only begins to falter when Lyra (the heroine) leaves the bear kingdom to meet her first-act climax. Pullman stumbles through an expository patch here and a finale that comes off as slightly less than readable. The book, much likeThe Fellowship of the Ringends without an ending, leaving the conclusion for future installments.________________The Subtle KnifeTypically, the middle chapter in a trilogy is its weak point, so the greater turn toward mediocrity wasn't so worrisome and I didn't quite see in it the grave portent that I ought to have (hindsight, eh?).The second installment introduces a hero into the mix. Will, who is on the cusp of his teen years just like Lyra, actually hails from our world. And through happy accident or fate or dull contrivance both finds himself in league with Lyra and the chosen wielder of a knife that can cut through the fabric between worlds. The two team up and have a number of relatively dull adventures as we learn more about the great war brewing between heaven and earth and about the prophecy that Lyra is to be the new Eve and that she is to perpetrate a great betrayal and the freedom of all the worlds is at stake. Also introduced is an ex-nun-now-particle-physicist named Mary Malone who is prophesied to be the serpent/tempter to Lyra's Eve.An interesting set-up for the final book despite being introduced by three-hundred pages of boredom punctuated by moments of ingenuity and interest.________________The Amber SpyglassBook three was just a mess. It's almost nonsensical as it strives against reason and its own narrative to bring the story to some kind of resolution. The great betrayal prophesied? Not really a betrayal at all. Lyra being tempted? Never happens. Mary playing the role of the serpent? Nope. She just kind of stands around. Oh, and the big plan to take war to heaven and kill God? Has nothing to do with anything in the story really. Though they do end up killing the Enoch from some world. The last 250 pages are baffling. There is no climax. The plot contrivances are painful. I'm not even sure what the point of the story was. Things happen because in Pullman's mind they need to, not because it would make any sense for something to happen a certain way.It's hard to believe it but this book was worse actually thanThe Da Vinci Code. At least that was merely stupid. This was stupid, senseless, and (perhaps worst of all) boring. It's what I imagineEragonwould have been if I would have made it past page one hundred.________________So then, as a whole?His Dark Materialsis bad news for readers. From a moderately strong start it quickly turns into a preachy, meandering production of less than an infinite number of monkeys typing for slightly less than eternity. This is probably what half those monkeys would hit upon after about a year and a half. Pullman sets in motion things in volume one that never bear fruit. He never satisfactorily explains the things that one would expect that he should have explained. He provides no climax. His narrative is a shambles. He creates a character (Father Gomez), sends him on a mission to kill Lyra, follows him around for an inordinate amount of time, and then kills him without there ever being a confrontation between himself and his prospective victim. And then there are the mulefa. Don't get me started.Additionally, his characters are cardboard cutouts who express whichever motive Pullman decides is necessary - no matter the fact that there is no reasonable expectation that these characters should behave so. The aeronaut decides really out of the blue that he loves Lyra (a girl he doesn't even really know) like a daughter and will do anything to protect her. The principle witch meets Mary Malone, talks with her for a few minutes, and then declares them sisters for life. It's all just baffling.Recently, having criticized those who expressed how well-written the series is, I was put to notice thatHis Dark Materialshas won a number of awards. I find this a chilling revelation and it wasn't 'til I recalled thatLeft Behindwas a phenomenal bestseller that I was comforted that this was just business as usual for a civilization that is so steeped in mediocrity that it awards the title of Greatness to that which dare not even approach the servant quarters of Greatness for fear of overstepping its bounds. I think people want so badly to think highly of something, to think it the next whatever-recently-great-thing-comes-to-mind, that they abandon all sense of what is in order to do so.Shame on Philip Pullman and shame on our society for encouraging such dreck. Remember, if you praise it, it will be emulated., error: Day late and a dollar short with this one.My hope was to have read and reviewedHis Dark Materialstrilogy before the film adaptation of the first third,The Golden Compass, came out last Friday. And I would have too - if it weren't for that sheer enormity of suckiness that was the third book in the series (The Amber Spyglass). *sigh* But then, life doesn't actually work out perfectly for us as often as we'd like. Sometimes there are earthquakes that level cities in Turkey. Sometimes Spinach is found to test positive for Salmonella. Sometimes a country introduces democracy to another. And sometimes, just sometimes, Philip Pullman writes a book.Now I don't want it to sound like the series is the worst ever written. It's not. It's not even the worst I've ever read. Not entirely anyway. The fact is there are three books and they should be treated separately before we get to the series as a whole. So then, to the review! (times three.)Oh yeah. And there'll be some spoilers in there. Not that it matters. Seriously.________________The Golden CompassA third of the way into Pullman's first installment ofHis Dark Materials, I was excited. While Pullman wasn't the most eloquent of writers and his characters had yet to really develop at all, it was clear he had an exciting imagination and was as good at world-building as nearly any fantasy author. He had developed an alternate history for our world that while completely foreign was largely analogous to our own that it didn't seem like a different world entirely. They have science and electricity and particle physics and everything - they just call it by a different name.The real joy and conceit of the series though is Pullman's use of daemons, animal expressions of every character's soul. These familiars are constant companions of every human, expressing through their animal nature the nature and quality of their human companion. And the daemons of children have yet to find a stabilized form and so flit forth and back and over and again through a host of forms - from owl to ermine to tabby to dolphin to moth to monkey. Et cetera.Throughout the first book's clumsy storytelling, there is still something that approaches near to wonder. Enough to satisfy some readers. The first four-fifths of the narrative are brisk and enjoyable, and the book only begins to falter when Lyra (the heroine) leaves the bear kingdom to meet her first-act climax. Pullman stumbles through an expository patch here and a finale that comes off as slightly less than readable. The book, much likeThe Fellowship of the Ringends without an ending, leaving the conclusion for future installments.________________The Subtle KnifeTypically, the middle chapter in a trilogy is its weak point, so the greater turn toward mediocrity wasn't so worrisome and I didn't quite see in it the grave portent that I ought to have (hindsight, eh?).The second installment introduces a hero into the mix. Will, who is on the cusp of his teen years just like Lyra, actually hails from our world. And through happy accident or fate or dull contrivance both finds himself in league with Lyra and the chosen wielder of a knife that can cut through the fabric between worlds. The two team up and have a number of relatively dull adventures as we learn more about the great war brewing between heaven and earth and about the prophecy that Lyra is to be the new Eve and that she is to perpetrate a great betrayal and the freedom of all the worlds is at stake. Also introduced is an ex-nun-now-particle-physicist named Mary Malone who is prophesied to be the serpent/tempter to Lyra's Eve.An interesting set-up for the final book despite being introduced by three-hundred pages of boredom punctuated by moments of ingenuity and interest.________________The Amber SpyglassBook three was just a mess. It's almost nonsensical as it strives against reason and its own narrative to bring the story to some kind of resolution. The great betrayal prophesied? Not really a betrayal at all. Lyra being tempted? Never happens. Mary playing the role of the serpent? Nope. She just kind of stands around. Oh, and the big plan to take war to heaven and kill God? Has nothing to do with anything in the story really. Though they do end up killing the Enoch from some world. The last 250 pages are baffling. There is no climax. The plot contrivances are painful. I'm not even sure what the point of the story was. Things happen because in Pullman's mind they need to, not because it would make any sense for something to happen a certain way.It's hard to believe it but this book was worse actually thanThe Da Vinci Code. At least that was merely stupid. This was stupid, senseless, and (perhaps worst of all) boring. It's what I imagineEragonwould have been if I would have made it past page one hundred.________________So then, as a whole?His Dark Materialsis bad news for readers. From a moderately strong start it quickly turns into a preachy, meandering production of less than an infinite number of monkeys typing for slightly less than eternity. This is probably what half those monkeys would hit upon after about a year and a half. Pullman sets in motion things in volume one that never bear fruit. He never satisfactorily explains the things that one would expect that he should have explained. He provides no climax. His narrative is a shambles. He creates a character (Father Gomez), sends him on a mission to kill Lyra, follows him around for an inordinate amount of time, and then kills him without there ever being a confrontation between himself and his prospective victim. And then there are the mulefa. Don't get me started.Additionally, his characters are cardboard cutouts who express whichever motive Pullman decides is necessary - no matter the fact that there is no reasonable expectation that these characters should behave so. The aeronaut decides really out of the blue that he loves Lyra (a girl he doesn't even really know) like a daughter and will do anything to protect her. The principle witch meets Mary Malone, talks with her for a few minutes, and then declares them sisters for life. It's all just baffling.Recently, having criticized those who expressed how well-written the series is, I was put to notice thatHis Dark Materialshas won a number of awards. I find this a chilling revelation and it wasn't 'til I recalled thatLeft Behindwas a phenomenal bestseller that I was comforted that this was just business as usual for a civilization that is so steeped in mediocrity that it awards the title of Greatness to that which dare not even approach the servant quarters of Greatness for fear of overstepping its bounds. I think people want so badly to think highly of something, to think it the next whatever-recently-great-thing-comes-to-mind, that they abandon all sense of what is in order to do so.Shame on Philip Pullman and shame on our society for encouraging such dreck.

            "Translation failed for: **Don't click the spoilers if you haven't read the book.**I think it's time to admit to myself that The Mortal Instruments and Infernal Devices series are just not for me. I suppose it's not a secret I'm not a huge fan of Cassandra Clare's work, but I won't deny that there were some things I did enjoy with each series. However, this was a disappointing read for me. I originally liked the premise of the first book in the Infernal Devices series, but this installment seemed to focus more on the character's relationships rather than the plot. It's the same problemCity of Fallen Angelshad, except I do thinkClockwork Princewas LOADS better than that.InClockwork PrinceThe Shadowhunters in the London Institute find themselves in a serious bind. Due to the startling turn of events inClockwork Angel, Charlotte is threaten to be removed as head of the institute unless she and the others can discover what the Magister is planning and capture him. The Shadowhunters immediately get to work diving into the Clave archives, searching for clues to the Magister's past. Unfortunately, it is not just his secrets that are exposed as the loyalties of the institute members are also revealed.That sounds fairly interesting, right? So what's my issue? Why couldn't I love this book? Well, if I put it bluntly: It was boring. The beginning took way to long to pick up and if I had to guess, I'd say nothing exciting happens until around page 250. Um, I don't know about you, but that iswaytoo long to keep me hanging. It took me 15 days to read this book. 15 days. At one point I just had to put it down for a few days and read something else because every time I picked up the book it would put me in this kind of mood:Sure the Shadowhuntersdidthings, but every time they were about to go on a mission we are given unnecessary descriptions of what Tessa is going to wear or how Sophie did her hair or how silver Jem's eyes looked that day. Who cares? The suspense leading up to the mission died while Tessa was taking her sweet ass time getting dressed. Speaking of Tessa, she is a pathetic heroine. She is good for one thing only: changing her appearance. She's not a fighter and despite her being trained in this book, she was virtually worthless. Yet, they always had to take her along on missions. When they actually used her power she manages to screw it up. They attend a \"bad guy's party\" (Just go with it. I don't want to spoil it for you.) and Tessa screws up her disguise because she drinks some type of spiked warlock lemonade. Yeah. I don't know about you, but when I'm crashing a bad guy's party, I never drink the punch. So she's walking around as herself and none of the evil dudes seem to notice or care. HUH? But she's an idiot, so I don't expect much from her. However, Will drinks it too. At that point I'm thinking, \"You've been a Shadowhunter forhowlong exactly?\" That scene made no sense.Even though the book was boring, that's not even my biggest issue with it. While I was reading I always felt disconnected to the characters. The only character I did care about was Jem and that's probably because he's the only one who didn't seem like a direct rip-off from the Mortal Instruments series. I felt flashes of these characters inClockwork Angel, but now I'm fully convinced thatDraco/HarryWill is Jace,Hermione/GinnyTessa is Clary, ect.Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice--Nope. I see what you did there.WillJace. I hate this guy. He reminds me of the Jace in City of Fallen Angels. \"I can't be with you because it will kill you! So I'm going to act like the shitiest person on earth so you will hate me!\" Sound familiar anyone? Seriously, there are only so many times you can recycle a plot twist before you become predictable. I'm not sure you can evencallit a plot twist anymore. So not only is he a carbon copy of Jace, but he goes through the same tortured character issue too? No, I'm not buying that. He was the reason why I almost didn't finish the book. He's such a prick and Tessa knows it, but she still loves him \"because there is justsomethingabout him!\" *eyeroll* Yes, I'm well aware of the curse, but that entire situation never seemed real to me anyway.It was so obvious that the curse was a fake. \"Everyone who loves you will die! Muahahaha!\" What kind of lame curse is that? And why did Will think no one loved him? Charlotte's love for him was just pouring off the pages. He didn't think it odd that she was still alive? Does anyone besides Jem use their brain in this series?So when I finally get to the \"good part,\" some things happen that are supposed to shock me, I guess. There is this big revelation made right before the fight scene.We find out Nate and Tessa aren't brother and sister.WAIT. Didn't you use that revelation is City of Glass, Clare?? Please stop putting you plot twists through the laundry wash cycle. It doesn't make them new again. *sigh*After the fight scene, there is still a good 75 pages left and I was hoping for more action. But, of course, there is none. Most of it is filled with more relationship drama that surprisingly made me happy. However, it will most likely piss off fans of the series. LOL.That's right, Will! You areshitoutta luck!There is a cliffhanger at the end of the book, but by that time I was so through with it all, that it didn't move me one bit.The writing was difficult for me, but I've never really jived well with Clare's style. Death to those bloody commas! My eyes are waving little white surrender flags! O_o Another thing I found strange was that Tessa is supposed to be American (right?), but it seemed like she still sounded English. In other words, all of the characters spoke very similarly. There was only one time when Tessa used an American slang term and it felt odd and out of place. And how many times must the word 'quite' be used? \"Oh, you are quite right!\" \"This is quite uncomfortable.\" \"I don't think you quite understand.\" I'm pretty sure 'quite' is used every few pages and it's annoying. The characters are trying so hard to sound English. It just didn't work for me.Will I read Clockwork Princess? I don't know, maybe. The only reason I'm remotely curious is because I want to see what's going to happen to Jem. I like that guy. Yeah, I know. The volcanoes in hell are freezing over because I actually really like one of Clare's characters.

            "Translation failed for: She Aches Just like a WomanI’ll start off with something that I thought was interesting (hint: it borders on being annoying). For the first 75 pages, characters move in and out of this book with such swiftness and with no mention of physical description or notable characteristics, it mimics the effect of being at a really crowded party where you meet face after face, name after name and you have no time to process who is who, why they are significant and if you should even bother to remember them; so at the very least, the book is able to imitate the “big-party-greeting” that seems to permeate throughout the lives of the characters, but this only goes so far; that section is one long boring party that requires the minimum amount of your attention to understand what all these vapid, vacuous people are doing and what their current life drama is all about. Sure, there might be a great deal of interesting people moving in and out of your living room, but everyone is so focused on getting plastered drunk (on absinthe mind you), that no one cares about anything but what the most superficial impression of a person can yield.Whoo, my attempt at a complement turns into a nasty criticism and my struggle to appreciate Hemingway continues.The Iceberg Theory. Ya’ll know it. It doesn’t bear repeating but I will anyway. The gist of it is, is that in order to involve the reader as the author should, he must properly convey the depth of human emotion by giving the most minute of details, so that the full depth of a scene is communicatedimplicitlynot explicitly. The theory revolves around the idea that feelings unspoken, are more profound than feelings spoken. And up until this point, I couldn’t agree with Hemingway more. How many times can you read a story thatgives it all away? What’s the point of feeling the emotion of a story, if we have to be reminded that “John is feeling sad. John cried”. It freezes the drama; the characters go stiff. Yet, I couldn’t disagree more with Hemingway’s execution of the iceberg theory. If words are to allude to a much deeper reservoir of meaning, then shouldn’t eachwordbe dense, double-entendréd and deeply consequential? I am reminded time and time again, that there is a wrong way to take this theory. Plus I am overcome with the feeling thatall of poetry operates on this same principle, yet Hemingway writes the most dull and framework prose I’ve ever read. How could someone fully embrace the Iceberg Theory and then write a line like:“It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches”?A few lines earlierwe were told that they are in Spain. So Hemingway writes that the nice churches located in Spain are likenice Spanish churches. Ugh.Then there are literalchunksof this book that screamlook at me! Look how much I researched for this novel!, that contain descriptions making an american tourist of France's handbook seem like a high-octane thrill ride:“We came unto the Rue du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val de Grâce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the Boulevard du Port Royal. . . We walked along Port Royal until it became Mountparnasse, and then on past the Lilas, Lavigne’s, and all the little cafés, Damoy’s, crossed the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.”This is not what I read fiction for.There could be a lot of emotional depth coursing underneath all this banal prose, but it is all lost on me. I know that many people find this book to be their favorite of Hemingway, but without much action, where is the pleasure? Which I posit to be Hemingway’s biggest strength. All the bull-fights and thecorriendo de los torroswere quite strong; they were the only things worthwhile,but there is still something that bothered me; why wasn’t the heroic and idealized Pedro Romero killed? Wouldn’t that have been so much more interesting/tragic/thematically significant in light of Hemingway’s oft used “failed masculinity”, if Pedro Romero had been killed? He is the ultimate symbol of macho libido; wouldn’t that have played so well into a book about an impotent man? But instead we’re told that a Vicente Girones died; who the fuck is that? Why do I even care? It’s all this meaningless minutia of names and places, that fall completely flat and hardly engage me as a reader.I could learn a lot from Hemingway about how to properly write brutal violence or any scene where men face tough adversity. Heck, even the fishing trip is one of the more exciting parts of this book. Hemingway’s strengths are on beautiful display inFor Whom the Bell Tolls. This is because the book is set during the Spanish Civil War. I even enjoyed the imitation Castilian Spanish, and needlessly translated dialogue; I felt that Hemingway had achieved a tone that befit the old-time feel of its characters and story, but without much of anything happening inThe Sun Also Rises, I can’t say that this would be worth your time.One last thing, to tie in the review’s title. I couldn’t stand the main female character. Like not even for a few pages. I started to loath her so much, that I started to wonderis this the point?. Now, enough ink has been spilled over Papa Hemingway’s possible sexist leanings, but this is one despicable cock-tease of a female protagonist. Whoever inspired him to feature such a lady to be theonly female character in the entire bookmust have given Hemingway’s heart quite the roller coaster ride. That being said, this book was written in the 20’s. And I have to maintain my rule of thumb that anything written before 1975 containing flagrant sexism or racism must be given a cultural pass. It’s messed up, I know. But I must take the fact that there is a racial slur on every other page of this book with a grain of salt.As I read this review over, it really seems like I hated this book. Well I did. But there were parts that were great.So here’s the thing.I will admit that I’m not one who takes to plot very often. I tend to err on the side of beautiful writing, even if it’s for the sake of beautiful writing. I am willing to admit, at any time, that Hemingway is justnot for me. But I’m struggling to understand how Hemingway could be foranyone.I am always open to having my mind changed. That is what I love about this site. So please, make your case for the Papa! I want to hear why I’m wrong. Bring it on!Because I want to love Hemingway. I really do.p.s. Goodreads wouldn't let me post my real recommendation.It should say \"I would recommend to: Men who enjoy their women like their bull-fights, wild, violent and leaving a gaping hole where your heart used to be\", error: She Aches Just like a WomanI’ll start off with something that I thought was interesting (hint: it borders on being annoying). For the first 75 pages, characters move in and out of this book with such swiftness and with no mention of physical description or notable characteristics, it mimics the effect of being at a really crowded party where you meet face after face, name after name and you have no time to process who is who, why they are significant and if you should even bother to remember them; so at the very least, the book is able to imitate the “big-party-greeting” that seems to permeate throughout the lives of the characters, but this only goes so far; that section is one long boring party that requires the minimum amount of your attention to understand what all these vapid, vacuous people are doing and what their current life drama is all about. Sure, there might be a great deal of interesting people moving in and out of your living room, but everyone is so focused on getting plastered drunk (on absinthe mind you), that no one cares about anything but what the most superficial impression of a person can yield.Whoo, my attempt at a complement turns into a nasty criticism and my struggle to appreciate Hemingway continues.The Iceberg Theory. Ya’ll know it. It doesn’t bear repeating but I will anyway. The gist of it is, is that in order to involve the reader as the author should, he must properly convey the depth of human emotion by giving the most minute of details, so that the full depth of a scene is communicatedimplicitlynot explicitly. The theory revolves around the idea that feelings unspoken, are more profound than feelings spoken. And up until this point, I couldn’t agree with Hemingway more. How many times can you read a story thatgives it all away? What’s the point of feeling the emotion of a story, if we have to be reminded that “John is feeling sad. John cried”. It freezes the drama; the characters go stiff. Yet, I couldn’t disagree more with Hemingway’s execution of the iceberg theory. If words are to allude to a much deeper reservoir of meaning, then shouldn’t eachwordbe dense, double-entendréd and deeply consequential? I am reminded time and time again, that there is a wrong way to take this theory. Plus I am overcome with the feeling thatall of poetry operates on this same principle, yet Hemingway writes the most dull and framework prose I’ve ever read. How could someone fully embrace the Iceberg Theory and then write a line like:“It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches”?A few lines earlierwe were told that they are in Spain.

I read it because I wanted to know how it all ended and to be done with the series. I had no good expectations of this book because I was less than impressed with Blood Promises and despised Spirit Bound. People in love with this series should stop reading about now.Because, to be honest, reading this book was like reading an alcoholic unicorn chucking-up rainbows while small children clap. If that sounds kind of awesome then I think life may not have been kind to you.I should also preface by saying that I am neither Team Adrian nor Team Dimitri, though I am most certainly Team Shut-The-Hell-Up-Rose! Every big problem I have with the series shows up in this book and it is fuelled by Mead's juvenile love of infantile plot and soap-opera worthy melodrama.For one, Rose, who I had believed to be a half-decent character even by the end of Blood Promises, continues her nose-dive into craptastic whore and regular pain-in-the-arse-brat. I have heard several times that she ‘grows’ in this book. Unless these people are on a measuring scale comparable to the rate of growth for the shifting of giant fucking glaciers over a matter of hours, then I think some people are deluding themselves. You know, I don’t even mind a bratty character as long as it’s obvious by the surrounding text, story, and supporting characters that she is a giant brat who deserves to get bitch slapped. Preferably by Wayne Brady.However, everyone in this series fawns over Rose as if she’s the second coming of the butt-kicking messiah and she is constantly praised as a hero of legendary proportions who is kind, caring, selfless and always there for others.Rose’s minor, trivial and easily forgotten concerns over the lives she’s ruined to achieve her ends are quickly dismissed at the end of the story. No. Rose Hathaway doesn’t ruin lives. She saves them. She doesn’t demand people give up their only daughter to a life of vicious court politics just so her best friend gets a freakin’ council vote. She doesn’t expect her friends to jeopardize their careers to help her with her love life/criminal career only to ditch them immediately after because, hey, their concerns aren’t her concerns. She doesn’t heartlessly cheat on her boyfriend, acknowledge to herself that it’s a bad time to dump him because he could still be useful and then later tell him off for being a victim in her great dumping speech.Nooo…er, wait. Yeah, she does do all of that.Then, of course, is Rose’s great love of public speaking which, once again, pops up in this book.Christian: Hey Rose, did you ever think it might be a good idea to tell the authorities and your friends about who the killer is first, in private, so that some of them aren't publicly humiliated and embarrassed while having their world pulled out from under them in front of hundreds of people?Rose: Er…Christian: Yeah, that’s what I thought…The girl needs to line up at the Ministry of Ridiculous Speeches (right next to the Ministry of Silly Walks) to get public funding every time the council is stupid enough to let her have free reign on a mic. Which, by the way, has so far been pretty much EVERY time. You’d think they would have learned by now and Kung Fu’d her vocal chords before she could open her stupid mouth at a public function.There is of course, someone more annoying.

Finally, this is what she’s been waiting for. After all the heart ache, all the disappointment, all of the dashed-dreams! “Really, Dimitri? Do you think maybe… can you love again?”Dimitri’s gaze drops and his features stiffen as flakes of snow drop around them in some crazy literary metaphor for dramatic tension. “We can’t talk about it. It’s not right.”Rose stops, her face screwing into annoyance. “What do you mean we can’t talk about it? Why can’t we talk about it?”He turns away, with a flash of cold eyes. His shoulders are stiff and his voice is chilling. “Nothing. We have to go.”Rose’s jaw drops and she stares at him in disbelief. “If we can’t talk about it then why the fuck did you bring it up?”Dimitri glances back in confusion. “What do you mean, Rose? Er… not that we should be talking about this or anything… but, really, what do you mean?”Rose crosses her arms over her chest, shaking her head in disbelief. “If you don’t want to talk about it then stop getting me into sexually charged situations and making mysterious comments about how beautiful I am. It’s kind of unfair, don’t you think?”Dimitri stares into her face with a blank expression, shock colouring his features into stupid disbelief.

So there ya go. Don't say I didn't warn ya.I have never been in love with Vampire Academy. No book in the series has ever warranted more than four stars on my part, and I haven't bought any of them, either forcing my brother to buy it (\"I'll promise to pay you back!\" Not) or borrowing them from the library. If I had enjoyed this series more overall, as many of my friends did, perhaps I would have been less frustrated with this book. I always saw this series had potential, but instead Mead pulled a Meyer andepically failed.Shouldn't a series improve as it progresses and not make me want to cry anger tears? My forehead hurts from all the headdesking and facepalming I did. I'm not even kidding. I look like John Green did after he failed to follow proper headdesk safety regulations (Only he could fail at expressing disdain for failure). Anyway, my face hurts, I'm a little dizzy, and I've been stuck trying to finish this book for a week now and its all Richelle Mead's fault. That's damn right. I'm a victim.In the first VA book, I thought Rose Hathaway was a little immature, but refreshing because she could take care herself when most YA heroines can't even tie their own goddamn shoes without complaining. But in the end, she turned out just like the rest of them: self-absorbed and as annoying as hell. This isn't passive dislike either. I actively hate her. Over the course of the novel I have called her every name in the book, and I am one bit of \"Rose-logic\" away from tearing apart this novel with my teeth. Rose is justinsufferable. She very well might be the most FRIGGIN ANNOYING PERSON IN EXISTENCE. Hey, Rose, ever hear of a little thing called \"humility\"? Oh, I'm sorry, is it not badass enough for you? Does it undermine your awesome hero epicness? I guess so.Rose needs to get frickin over herself. God, even thewritingwas pompous, using phrases like \"clearly\" and \"obviously\" like a four year old uses lip-gloss. She is completely self-absorbed and condescending towards others, looking down on those who didn't meet her standards of badassery. And seeming as everyone except Dimitri and herself failed to meet this standard, she was looked down upon people a lot. OMG. If I have to hearone more wordabout her super-special guardian abilities, I shall shoot a leprechaun in the nads. No, no, no. She couldn't just watch and participate in a conversation like mortal beings. She had use her guardian training which would scour facial expressions and hidden movements, picking up details that us weak and untrained humans would miss, pointing out the obvious as if she just won the Nobel Peace Prize. Nothing could ever just happen with her. It had to be action-y in some way. She didn't think, ideas \"hit her\". Everything was done \"without a moment's hesitation\" and with force. It was just obnoxious. I could go on and on, really, about all the sentence that annoyed me on every page, but I have feeling this review is already tedious.In this book, Rose is kind of like a less-awesome version ofLeeroy Jenkinswithout the chicken. In real life, Rose, people will not just succumb to your awry plans then pat you on the head afterwards for your impulsivity after everything has gone annoyingly right. In real life, dragons kill you.Rose just has no consideration for others. She always thinks her way is the best. Forget the lives she ruins along the way, she's \"putting them first\" and isn't that what matters most? Hardy har har. Tell that to Jill (who you didn't even ask) and Christian (who you didn't even consult with). You didn't mind hurting them, did ya, Rose, as long as you had your dramatic reveal? BTW, who the hell let her near a microphone again? Come here so I can punch you.Back at the court, I felt like everyone was the Mystery Gang, except without the banging van and Scooby-Doo. What is the Mystery Gang without Scooby-Doo? A bunch of tools, thats what. They had no personalities of their own, just working as pawns in Mead's little game. Even my poor, sweet Adrian was glossed over.Do. Not. Get. Me. Started. On. Adrian. God, Rose is SUCH A BITCH. *rude gesture rude gesture rude gesture*Dimitri, you turned out to be a real prick, ya know that? I've never really liked you but now I really don't like you. Lissa, aren't you just the perfect little queen? *gags on bile* All the rest of the characters aren't really important enough to discuss individually.Oh, and I'm also really pissed at what Mead did to Tasha. First she makes a character who not only has a social stigma but also a physical deformity, makes her out into this crazed activist, and then turns her into this petty character who kills to get her guy. Bad form, Mead. Bad form.Another thing I found annoying was the constant back-and-forth between Rose and the court. Not only does the \"bond\" being such a blatant plot device really bother me, but it seemed Rose would be in Lissa's head for hours. Hours! Doesn't Rose being like the ADHD's five-year-old that she is, get a little tired of that? I know this book was mostly stalling, but she seemed to waste a lot of time.There are many and plenty of other things I hate about this book, but I am done typing. Overall, I hated it. I will not be reading Mead's next series, Bloodlines, for she is clearly only looking for money at this point, as evidenced by her unoriginal prose, glaring typos (it is \"though\" not \"thought\"), and tacky loose ends. I am just so annoyed. In the end, Rose got everything she wanted, unscathed.One more thing. The cover? Total porn star look. Every person I asked agreed with me.

What is the Mystery Gang without Scooby-Doo? A bunch of tools, thats what. They had no personalities of their own, just working as pawns in Mead's little game. Even my poor, sweet Adrian was glossed over.Do. Not. Get. Me. Started. On. Adrian. God, Rose is SUCH A BITCH. *rude gesture rude gesture rude gesture*Dimitri, you turned out to be a real prick, ya know that? I've never really liked you but now I really don't like you. Lissa, aren't you just the perfect little queen? *gags on bile* All the rest of the characters aren't really important enough to discuss individually.Oh, and I'm also really pissed at what Mead did to Tasha. First she makes a character who not only has a social stigma but also a physical deformity, makes her out into this crazed activist, and then turns her into this petty character who kills to get her guy. Bad form, Mead. Bad form.Another thing I found annoying was the constant back-and-forth between Rose and the court. Not only does the \"bond\" being such a blatant plot device really bother me, but it seemed Rose would be in Lissa's head for hours. Hours! Doesn't Rose being like the ADHD's five-year-old that she is, get a little tired of that? I know this book was mostly stalling, but she seemed to waste a lot of time.There are many and plenty of other things I hate about this book, but I am done typing. Overall, I hated it. I will not be reading Mead's next series, Bloodlines, for she is clearly only looking for money at this point, as evidenced by her unoriginal prose, glaring typos (it is \"though\" not \"thought\"), and tacky loose ends. I am just so annoyed. In the end, Rose got everything she wanted, unscathed.One more thing. The cover? Total porn star look. Every person I asked agreed with me. I was embarrassed to be seen reading this due to the sucky content, melodramatic title, and Miss Pouty Lips. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

It was published posthumously in 1980, over a decade after Toole ended his own life by carbon monoxide poisoning. Despite having been earlier rejected by publishers, the book went on to win the Pulitzer Prize.A Confederacy of Duncesis a rambling, aimless, comedic novel centered on Ignatius J. Reilly, a buffoonish overweight man-child with poor fashion sense, worse social skills, and deplorable hygiene. Through 400 pages – which is relatively long for a book in which nothing happens – we follow Ignatius through various minor misadventures: Ignatius goes to a bar; Ignatius gets a job at Levy Pants and attempts to unionize the factory; Ignatius sells hotdogs; Ignatius – in what passes for a large set piece – attempts to use a gay soiree as a political rally.Comedy is all about personal, subjective reactions.

Perhaps a bit imprecise as well. Overall, I strongly disliked the book. But I hatedeveryonein it. Based on the epigram by Jonathan Swift, it is clear that Toole’s title refers to Ignatius’s worldview: that his inflated sense of intelligence, his delusions of grandeur, and his unrelenting condescension has created a paradigm in which he believes that every other person in this world is an idiot. And what is more, he thinks this idiot-filled world is in league against him.I took the title differently. I assumed it to be Toole’s worldview.

I considered the possibility, and though there is a grain of truth, I don’t think it’s entirely accurate. It was not the characters’ un-likability that struck me; it was their creator’s disdain. Toole appears to despise his own characters. How could I feel otherwise?Ignatius is a tiresome, boorish person to follow. He is disruptive, dishonest, and frankly disgusting.

Christine is still a useless twit, and in this version comes upgraded with zero observation skills and a seriously misguided sense of priorities.

This is important, because in the book she spends at least two months as the Phantom's prisoner, and all we get is her description, later, of what it was like. Instead of seeing the Phantom through Christine's eyes, where he might have been a more compelling character, we just get to watch Raoul follow her around like a creeper and then listen to Christine give lengthy expositional speeches after events happen.-The Phantom isn't actually that cool. He's always bursting into tears and begging Christine to love him, and the rest of the time he's so incredibly misguided about his relationship with Christine that it's almost funny. He comes off sounding like one of those perverts on cop shows who insists that he and the ten-year-old locked in his basement actually have a very special and loving relationship, while the cops are just looking at him like, that's nice, man, but your ass is still going to jail.-There are way more characters than we need, and a lot of them are different (read: worse) than they are in the show. Madame Giry, last seen as a cool, commanding ballet mistress, is merely a crazy old woman who works for the Phantom because he deceived her with the most idiotic lie ever.

I bet you guys are wondering how that's going, huh? Let's check in with them quick.\" And before you can say, no, Gaston, I actually wasn't wondering thatat all, he makes you slog throughtwo goddamn chaptersabout the new managers trying to figure out how the Phantom collects their money.Similarly, once Raoul and the Persian have gone after the Phantom and are almost at his lair (a journey that takes way, way too long) they get locked in his torture chamber (which involves torture so stupid I won't even describe it) and the plot comes to a damnstandstillas Raoul and the Persian spends hours trapped there. It made me actually long for the show, where everything skips along at a fast clip and the worst digressions are five-minute love songs.-The ending is stupid.

This somehow convinces the Phantom that she loves Raoul and that he should let them go, and that's how the Phantom is defeated.

            "Translation failed for: SPOILER ALERTCassandra Clare really should have let sleeping dogs lie.“City of Fallen Angels” is yet another book in the Young Adult category that lacks the “element of surprise.” The fact that this book was even written despite formerly having established that ‘The Mortal Instruments’ series to be a trilogy is evidence enough that Clare was tempted by her successes within the urban fantasy genre, and decided to continue.The fact that Clare continued the story is not my problem; it is the manner in which the plotline has been executed (which to reiterate lacks the element of surprise) that disappoints me. “City of Glass” ended definitively - bad, bad Valentine is dead, the seeds of harmony have been sewn between Nephilim and Downworlders, and Jace and Clary get their mushy, predictable happily ever after. It seems as though with this newest installation, Clare asked herself, “How can I possibly continue this?” and unfashionably, she dug up open ended dramatic quotes, such as “to love is to destroy”, and used them in order to create tension. Instead of putting faith in the audience’s imagination to keep her story alive, our beloved author took the task into her own hands and ironically, destroyed all that she forged with love.Clary and Jace start to have relationship problems. Magnus and Alec start to have relationship problems. Simon is dating two girls simultaneously, one of which would realistically have never given him the time of day, because his latest vampirism is apparently a way for Isabelle to see the goodness of his heart and appreciate him beyond his looks (not that those enhanced cheekbones aren’t delicious). Oh, and I almost forgot, Sebastian Verlac/Jonathan Morgernstern isn’t quite dead! I feel almost insulted; Cassandra Clare is treating us, the audience, as though we are infantile, or to borrow her words, as the “mundanes” that her characters so obviously despise. Instead of providing us with a decent, realistic plotline, Clare’s chosen to do nothing other than sever all that she previously created with her words.I will admit, if you’re looking for a quick fix, “City of Fallen Angels” is quite an easy and enjoyable read. The fact that this installation is Simon-centric was a pleasant attempted insight into the undead life - a brilliant contradiction - of the otherwise nerdy, annoying tagalong who unfortunately happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Jordan Kyle, despite the ridiculous name, was an interesting addition considering the tumultuous past with Maia (if you can get past the tortured internals soap opera). And don't you dare forget this season’s Big Bad, Lilith - yes, it's that demon bitch in yet another fantasy! Besides the astounding fact that Clare is too lazy to create her own villain and has decided to steal from God, she didn't even let this melodramatic page-turner develop on her own! Why must Clare handfeed me all the information? Alec and Isabelle spitting out past lectures on Greater Demons seemed to be a cheap attempt at unravelling whatever mystery that Lilith was. She ran away from Adam and God said “Thou shalt be barren forever, infidel!”? That’s a wonderful backdrop there, Ms. Clare, but could you be any more subtle? Having one of your characters race through the history as though it were ordering lunch is not in the least bit believable. I want you toshowme, not hold my hand and tell me what I need to cram before the big exam.All I ever see nowadays is young adult novels being dominated by devastatingly beautiful characters. It would be unfair for me to blame only Clare for this trend, but she never needed to follow it. The fact that Clare seems to think her fan base will stay tethered to her through the creation of beautiful superhumans makes me question her writing skills - does she not have the ability to keep her audience enthralled with unattractive characters? Actually, let’s take a step back: why are only the superhumans beautiful? Simon as a human - a nuisance, and nothing much to look at. Simon as a vampire - handsome and having trouble juggling the ladies. Clary as a mundane - androgynous body shape; no breasts, no hips. Clary as a Shadowhunter - one up the bra size! Look at those hips form! Apparently, not only is New York full of gorgeous creatures, but not one of them is human. Way to be realistic, huh?In the end, however, what bothers me the most is how desperate Clare is to save her characters falling from grace. Simon, in spite of toying with two potential girlfriends simultaneously, is forgiven by each! And that wretched Mark of Cain? Yes, the sevenfold vengeance is all very lovely, but what about the other part of the curse - “thou shalt wander the earth a fugitive”? If Simon is cursed to be a wanderer until the end of eternity, then how was Isabelle rushing to his aid? Why is Jace choosing to go to Simon, why is Clary still his best friend, and why is Kyle his protector? How could they possibly choose him if there is a powerful, binding curse that is constantly working to separate Simon from his loved ones? We know that the curse works because assassins impressively crumble to salt at Simon’s feet, so why on earth are we ignoring the second-half, the depressing part of the curse? I’m torn between branding it an obvious plot-hole, or just Ms. Clare’s overwhelming desire not to let one of her beloved characters exist alone. In my eyes, this undermines Clare’s integrity as a writer - if she cannot commit to the maxim she has presented for Simon, then how much can we truly trust her storytelling skill?The first three books, riddled as they were with bona-fide plot holes and histrionic dialogue, were to a degree more fathomable. Clare created a definitive story arc I could readily engage with. While “City of Fallen Angels” didn’t make me contemplate skewering my eyeballs or washing my brain with bleach, it is not one I will return to in the near future. Instead of keeping me on my toes, Clare cheaply proffered a broken story arc for a few more minutes in the spotlight, and ultimately destroyed her credibility as a writer who values constancy.You can keep a story going on forever, but sometimes, you just aren’t meant to., error: SPOILER ALERTCassandra Clare really should have let sleeping dogs lie.“City of Fallen Angels” is yet another book in the Young Adult category that lacks the “element of surprise.” The fact that this book was even written despite formerly having established that ‘The Mortal Instruments’ series to be a trilogy is evidence enough that Clare was tempted by her successes within the urban fantasy genre, and decided to continue.The fact that Clare continued the story is not my problem; it is the manner in which the plotline has been executed (which to reiterate lacks the element of surprise) that disappoints me. “City of Glass” ended definitively - bad, bad Valentine is dead, the seeds of harmony have been sewn between Nephilim and Downworlders, and Jace and Clary get their mushy, predictable happily ever after. It seems as though with this newest installation, Clare asked herself, “How can I possibly continue this?” and unfashionably, she dug up open ended dramatic quotes, such as “to love is to destroy”, and used them in order to create tension. Instead of putting faith in the audience’s imagination to keep her story alive, our beloved author took the task into her own hands and ironically, destroyed all that she forged with love.Clary and Jace start to have relationship problems. Magnus and Alec start to have relationship problems. Simon is dating two girls simultaneously, one of which would realistically have never given him the time of day, because his latest vampirism is apparently a way for Isabelle to see the goodness of his heart and appreciate him beyond his looks (not that those enhanced cheekbones aren’t delicious). Oh, and I almost forgot, Sebastian Verlac/Jonathan Morgernstern isn’t quite dead! I feel almost insulted; Cassandra Clare is treating us, the audience, as though we are infantile, or to borrow her words, as the “mundanes” that her characters so obviously despise. Instead of providing us with a decent, realistic plotline, Clare’s chosen to do nothing other than sever all that she previously created with her words.I will admit, if you’re looking for a quick fix, “City of Fallen Angels” is quite an easy and enjoyable read. The fact that this installation is Simon-centric was a pleasant attempted insight into the undead life - a brilliant contradiction - of the otherwise nerdy, annoying tagalong who unfortunately happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Jordan Kyle, despite the ridiculous name, was an interesting addition considering the tumultuous past with Maia (if you can get past the tortured internals soap opera). And don't you dare forget this season’s Big Bad, Lilith - yes, it's that demon bitch in yet another fantasy! Besides the astounding fact that Clare is too lazy to create her own villain and has decided to steal from God, she didn't even let this melodramatic page-turner develop on her own! Why must Clare handfeed me all the information? Alec and Isabelle spitting out past lectures on Greater Demons seemed to be a cheap attempt at unravelling whatever mystery that Lilith was. She ran away from Adam and God said “Thou shalt be barren forever, infidel!”? That’s a wonderful backdrop there, Ms. Clare, but could you be any more subtle? Having one of your characters race through the history as though it were ordering lunch is not in the least bit believable. I want you toshowme, not hold my hand and tell me what I need to cram before the big exam.All I ever see nowadays is young adult novels being dominated by devastatingly beautiful characters. It would be unfair for me to blame only Clare for this trend, but she never needed to follow it. The fact that Clare seems to think her fan base will stay tethered to her through the creation of beautiful superhumans makes me question her writing skills - does she not have the ability to keep her audience enthralled with unattractive characters? Actually, let’s take a step back: why are only the superhumans beautiful? Simon as a human - a nuisance, and nothing much to look at. Simon as a vampire - handsome and having trouble juggling the ladies. Clary as a mundane - androgynous body shape; no breasts, no hips. Clary as a Shadowhunter - one up the bra size! Look at those hips form! Apparently, not only is New York full of gorgeous creatures, but not one of them is human. Way to be realistic, huh?In the end, however, what bothers me the most is how desperate Clare is to save her characters falling from grace. Simon, in spite of toying with two potential girlfriends simultaneously, is forgiven by each! And that wretched Mark of Cain? Yes, the sevenfold vengeance is all very lovely, but what about the other part of the curse - “thou shalt wander the earth a fugitive”? If Simon is cursed to be a wanderer until the end of eternity, then how was Isabelle rushing to his aid? Why is Jace choosing to go to Simon, why is Clary still his best friend, and why is Kyle his protector? How could they possibly choose him if there is a powerful, binding curse that is constantly working to separate Simon from his loved ones? We know that the curse works because assassins impressively crumble to salt at Simon’s feet, so why on earth are we ignoring the second-half, the depressing part of the curse? I’m torn between branding it an obvious plot-hole, or just Ms. Clare’s overwhelming desire not to let one of her beloved characters exist alone. In my eyes, this undermines Clare’s integrity as a writer - if she cannot commit to the maxim she has presented for Simon, then how much can we truly trust her storytelling skill?The first three books, riddled as they were with bona-fide plot holes and histrionic dialogue, were to a degree more fathomable. Clare created a definitive story arc I could readily engage with. While “City of Fallen Angels” didn’t make me contemplate skewering my eyeballs or washing my brain with bleach, it is not one I will return to in the near future. Instead of keeping me on my toes, Clare cheaply proffered a broken story arc for a few more minutes in the spotlight, and ultimately destroyed her credibility as a writer who values constancy.You can keep a story going on forever, but sometimes, you just aren’t meant to. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: SPOILERS AHEAD!!What. the. f***. Words can't begin to express my disappointment. I bought Mockingjay the first day it came out and I was preparing myself for a truly epic novel, one worthy of its predecessors. I loved The Hunger Games; it was fast-paced, thrilling, suspenseful. Catching Fire wasn't as good but it was still enjoyable (I was majorly impressed by the game arena). I wasn't let down by Catching Fire though; I figured it was just a transition novel, build-up to what would undoubtedly be a mindblowing, epic conclusion in Mockingjay.Maybe I set my expectations too high. I do think Collins is a good writer; she definitely knows how to write and tell a story. But I feel like she lost her way in this book. Or maybe the only thing that made this series so great was the Hunger Games, and now that it's absent, there's nothing to drive the story.The love triangle wasn't well played out. First of all, I'm getting a bit tired of reading about love triangles -- especially in novels where there's a much greater plot present. But I'll admit, I was on Team Gale throughout the series, because he was strong and resilient and resourceful and caring. There was this attractive manly quality about him and he was so in sync with Katniss, and hot to boot. But towards the end of this novel, I didn't give a flying fart about Katniss's love life and who she ended up with, because everything seemed like such a hopeless, depressing mess that there was no point. I also hated how she kept flip-flopping and toying with both Gale and Peeta (I've been bothered by this since CF). She should make up her mind about who she wants instead of leading them both on! Her fickleness is pretty inconsiderate to these two guys whom she supposedly cares about. And if she can't decide (I can see why, they both have great qualities), then she should give herself some space/time to decide, and in the meantime, don't go kissing or showing romantic affection to either one!She ended up with Peeta, which would have been fine if it had been executed properly. But even in this aspect of her life, she didn't get to CHOOSE, which is basically the story of her life. She just ended up with Peeta because he was the only one who stuck around. At the end, I found myself wanting her to end up alone, of her OWN choice. Heck, instead of spiraling into bleak depression and continuing life as a puppet, I would have rather seen her die for a noble cause and for doing the right thing. That would have been a more satisfactory ending, and that's saying something because I normally HATE when characters die.I didn't like that we didn't get to experience the action close-up. As the war unraveled, I felt like Katniss was always on the sidelines, only called in when other people commanded her to. We didn't get to see Katniss kicking butt against her enemies, we got to hear from other characters about events that occurred, or watch them on the TV. It is so mindnumbingly dull to be watching a character watching something, instead of experiencing the action with the character. Everything she did was for show, for a propo or campaign or whatever. It was all so .. fake. Here they are in the middle of a war, people are dying left and right, and all they care about is filming and getting good shots and angles and putting on a pretty face! It felt so staged and it was boring and infuriating to read. The only real action is towards the end when she and her team are going on the assassin mission to kill Snow, and even THAT was originally only for a propo (that went astray).The last third of the book (the assassin mission) was gorey and bloody, which I didn't mind. It's war after all. But many characters' deaths were so rushed and pointless. Prim's death didn't have the impact that I'm sure Collins was aiming for; I didn't feel sad when she died, as she's barely in the story as it is, so I didn't get to know her well enough and connect with her beforehand. She was absent for at least 100 pages before her death came out of nowhere, for God's sake, so her death felt like any stranger's death. (Although it seems her death kind of defeated the point of sparing her from the Hunger Games.) What DID kill me was Finnick's death. Finnick was one of the characters I loved most in this series, and call me petty, but I can't forgive Collins for killing him off after he'd been through so much and finally got to marry the love of his life. It wasn't even a death of purpose. He got eaten by mutts in a sewer, along with half their assassin team. It annoyed me so much because their deaths felt so UNNECESSARY, like they were just a way for Collins to emphasize that \"this is a DEATHLY SERIOUS, VERY BLOODY BOOK!\" It felt like she was just randomly and meaninglessly killing off supporting characters because she couldn't bear to part with her main ones. Deaths are fine when they're important to the plot, but this felt like death for the sake of death.Okay, now on to the REAL disappointment of this book: Katniss herself. One of the reasons why I loved this series was because of Katniss. She was strong, resourceful, clever and cunning, she had an amazing survival instinct and she knew how to persevere. In Catching Fire, these qualities diminished; she was mainly a pawn, a puppet for others to use for their own objectives. But she still had some semblance of control and she was still Katniss. In Mockingjay, all these traits are scrapped and we get a Katniss-clone who is angsty and bitchy and whiny (wasn't Bella in Twilight bad enough?). Half the book, she's throwing herself pity parties in the closet (literally!). Sure, she definitely has reason to be sad and angry, and her life is full of hardships and tragedies. But I thought that the Katniss from the Hunger Games, the Katniss who had to keep her family alive since the age of 12, would be able to fight through and persevere. I guess I wanted a strong victor, a strong heroine, not a self-pitying victim who can't make her own decisions.That's another thing that bothered me: throughout the whole book, she had no control over ANYTHING, not even her own life and actions. She was a empty, lifeless pawn, a zombie if you will, who didn't do anything that wasn't directed or commanded by other people. In this novel, I was expecting her to STEP UP, embrace her role as Mockingjay, use her power/influence to get involved in the rebellion, take control of her life, and make a difference in the outcome of her world. I was expecting to see her grow and change and I was excited for her metamorphosis. Instead, we get this weak girl who's shirking all responsibilities, addled on drugs half the time, and lashing out at people the other half. Not only did she not improve herself from the first book (she was kickass in the first book btw), she got WORSE, an empty shadow of her former self. At the beginning, I could understand her confusion, her pain, her reluctance to be the Mockingjay. It'd be weird if she DIDN'T feel this way, if she didn't have that time of indecision and unwillingness. But after, I expected her to be strong and work through it, to face her fears and obstacles and choose to do the right thing, to really fight for justice. The best things in life never come easy; anybody who's done anything has had to overcome obstacles to accomplish their goals. When she decided: \"I must be the Mockingjay\", my heart soared (cheesy but it did!) and I was rooting for her 100%. When I heard her inspirational words during the propos, the fire behind them, my heart soared because I thought Katniss was back. But as I kept reading, I realized .. even though she verbally accepted her role, her mind still wasn't in it and she wasn't in control of herself. She didn't grow and become stronger, that's what pisses me off.The post-traumatic stress, the mental breakdowns, the self-pity, the self-loathing, the nearing of insanity .. all of these things are realistic, yes, but a bit tiresome and not very interesting to read when it's all the same and the narrator is drowning herself in it in the face of much greater things to the point where it detracts from the plot. These feelings shouldn't be the main focus throughout the ENTIRE novel. There has to be a turning point when she overcomes all of this and actively decides not to let these obstacles stand in her way. Now, many people will say her breakdown is more true to life, and it's what any normal 17-year-old girl would feel and go through. But, maybe I'm weird here, but for some stories, I don't WANT to read about the average, normal teenager. I want to read about someone who's a bit special, who's different, who displays traits (like courage, heart, perseverance) greater than the norm and accomplishes more than the \"normal, average teen\" even during the most difficult of times. Something that, when you close the book, makes you feel like \"Wow, they're amazing. Inspirational. I want to be like that.\" & to be honest, I didn't sign up to read a war documentary or some nonfiction account of how war affects its victims. I came in expecting a break from reality, a fantasy sci-fi young adult novel about a girl who becomes a hero.In trying to be as realistic as possible, I think Collins chose a pessimistic extreme of \"realism\" to portray. There are perfectly human people in real life in real circumstances who are able to fight through obstacles and hardships and come out on top without relying on drugs and hiding in closets. They can find more constructive and positive ways to deal with their problems. Sure, it obviously affects them (they're not invincible) but they don't lose themselves the way Katniss does. Those are the kinds of inspirational stories I wanna read when it comes to these kinds of novels, not this \"Diary of an Emo Puppet.\"This book was also REALLY anti-climactic. Whenever Collins finally gave us an exciting scene, as soon as it got intense, Katniss would get knocked out in the midst of things and we'd wake up to her in the hospital being treated. (MAJOR COP-OUT, in my opinion.) Then, of course, comes the inevitable centuries (that's what it felt like) of us hearing about her in pain and agony. Okay, we get it after reading about it the WHOLE novel! Now can she please pick herself up and make herself useful?Katniss doesn't deserve the title \"girl who was on fire\" and to be the main character in such an epic setting and story. Sure, she can be on fire, but only when someone sets her on fire or directs her to be on fire, not of her own doing. She was soulless and indifferent and cared about herself and her own feelings more than anyone else's (seeing as how she spends most of the novel grieving for herself and almost never for anyone else) .. if the main character, the narrator, doesn't care about anything and has no passion, why should we? What's the point when the main character whose eyes we're seeing through has no heart and no passion? And what happened to the selfless girl who willingly sacrificed her life to save her sister?The things I did like. I liked that Katniss had 2 seconds of mental clarity and shot Coin instead of Snow (the only time in the book when she was truly thinking clearly and acting of her own accord). I wonder if I'm giving her too much credit though; judging from her selfish one-track mind in this book, I fear that she did this only because Coin killed Prim, not because she saw the bigger picture. Worse yet, I fear this may just have been a result of Snow's manipulation, not her own decision. I also feel the significance and bravery of this smart moment was rendered meaningless by her immediate cowardly reaction: instead of having conviction in her action and facing the consequences, she scrambled frantically to find the most painless and quickest way to kill herself. She never once in the book acknowledges all she has to live for and all the positive things she still has in her life. When a character's will to survive is absent through a whole novel, I as a reader have no desire for them to live either; grant their wish already! But to continue on .. I liked learning about more of the characters in depth: Gale (who I grew to love even more in this book), Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, etc. I liked the ending passages (fitting and beautifully haunting) and I liked the songs (The Hanging Tree and the meadow one). There are probably some other things that I'll update this review with once disappointment and frustration are no longer clouding my brain.I wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a page-turner that was exciting to read, but trying to finish this book felt like a chore. When reading for enjoyment starts feeling like a chore, that's the ultimate sign that I dislike the book. 90% of the book, Katniss was wandering aimlessly through hallways, drugged out on morphling, hiding in a closet, or lying in a hospital bed. I kept waiting, I was so sure it would happen any minute, for the story-changing moment when Katniss would pick herself up and say \"Enough is enough.\" I kept waiting for the moment when the winds would change and she would decide with conviction to actively work through her problems -- but to my shock, that moment never came. This book seriously dragged and dragged and dragged, and just got slower and slower until everyone started dropping dead towards the last quarter of the book. The Hunger Games, I couldn't put it down; for this, I dreaded picking it up to finish it. I did tons of things in between reading this book (doing my nails, watching TV, taking a walk, etc) because I couldn't read it in one sitting without wanting to gouge my eyes out. It was the same reoccurring theme: Katniss was manipulated and controlled by everyone around her and she didn't think or do anything of her own will. It got old.I read all this build-up and didn't get rewarded for it. And even though the rebels triumphed, I didn't feel anything for them, not relief, not happiness, just nothing. I was just detached. And none of it was thanks to Katniss: her only role in the Capitol's defeat was watching Prim die, getting burned, and waking up in a hospital, where we're TOLD instead of SHOWN how the Capitol fell (all while she was unconscious, an occurrence that's way too common in this book).Again, anti-climactic! During the scene when it really mattered!I understand the message Collins is trying to convey and I agree with it: that war is awful and no one truly wins. And good and bad are not clearly defined black and white. (It got too preachy at certain points though, didn't it?) And I understand that not all books are unicorns-and-ponies happy endings, and that this series has always been intense and dark and a bit bleak. But that only works when there's an underlying message of hope and of optimism. I felt it in the 1st books, but this ending was devoid of all hope and happiness. Yes, humans are disgusting creatures who hurt and kill one another, who do horrible things because of greed and selfishness and just pure malice. But humans are also capable of love and compassion and kindness, and I wish she'd incorporated a bit of that into the story as well so there'd be a more hopeful ending. Even in real life, no matter how bad things may be, there is always hope. Isn't that the kind of message you really want young people to be left with? Instead of pessimistic doom and \"give up on mankind\"? I finished the book feeling hopeless and lost and depressed, and not in that deep, profound way where it motivates me to get up off my ass and do something to make a difference.Gosh, at least Harry was his own person and got to face Voldemort in the end. What did Katniss get to do except be an empty canvas for them to paint and feed lines to?Though I guess since I'm feeling so passionately about all of this, it wasn't a worthless read. It was just very, VERY disappointing.Edit:I just re-read this review a month or so after I wrote it and I sincerely apologize for my sloppy writing and overindulgence in run-on sentences! I was in a rush to unleash all my feelings after finishing the book so I wouldn't forget anything. I hope this review was understandable and enjoyable anyway :)That's the end of the review and you can stop here but I wanted to add on .. and I'm thinking those who grew up with Harry Potter like I did can relate:So I decided to re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to prepare myself for the upcoming movie, and to get the bitter taste of Mockingjay out of my mouth, and here's a passage towards the end where Harry's character really touched me and left me in awe:\"Because,\" said Harry, \"sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!\"\"You're seventeen, boy!\"\"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!\"a few sentences later .. \"I'm going to keep going until I succeed -- or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.\"Reading it again makes me all emotional and teary all over again, from Dobby's heartfelt burial to Harry's courageous walk to his death in the forest, knowing fully well what awaits him and yet willing to sacrifice himself for others and for a better world ...all the while, struggling with his fears and the temptation to run away .. and I swear, tears of pride and joy sprang from my eyes and exhilaration shot through my veins when Harry, the boy we grew up with, stepped up as a man and faced his enemy with confidence, strength, wisdom.Whatever faults the last HP book may have, I just have to say: Thank you, Harry, for giving me hope again and proving there are still admirable heroes in young literature., error: SPOILERS AHEAD!!What. the. f***. Words can't begin to express my disappointment. I bought Mockingjay the first day it came out and I was preparing myself for a truly epic novel, one worthy of its predecessors.

Okay, we get it after reading about it the WHOLE novel! Now can she please pick herself up and make herself useful?Katniss doesn't deserve the title \"girl who was on fire\" and to be the main character in such an epic setting and story. Sure, she can be on fire, but only when someone sets her on fire or directs her to be on fire, not of her own doing. She was soulless and indifferent and cared about herself and her own feelings more than anyone else's (seeing as how she spends most of the novel grieving for herself and almost never for anyone else) .. if the main character, the narrator, doesn't care about anything and has no passion, why should we? What's the point when the main character whose eyes we're seeing through has no heart and no passion? And what happened to the selfless girl who willingly sacrificed her life to save her sister?The things I did like. I liked that Katniss had 2 seconds of mental clarity and shot Coin instead of Snow (the only time in the book when she was truly thinking clearly and acting of her own accord). I wonder if I'm giving her too much credit though; judging from her selfish one-track mind in this book, I fear that she did this only because Coin killed Prim, not because she saw the bigger picture. Worse yet, I fear this may just have been a result of Snow's manipulation, not her own decision. I also feel the significance and bravery of this smart moment was rendered meaningless by her immediate cowardly reaction: instead of having conviction in her action and facing the consequences, she scrambled frantically to find the most painless and quickest way to kill herself. She never once in the book acknowledges all she has to live for and all the positive things she still has in her life. When a character's will to survive is absent through a whole novel, I as a reader have no desire for them to live either; grant their wish already! But to continue on .. I liked learning about more of the characters in depth: Gale (who I grew to love even more in this book), Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, etc. I liked the ending passages (fitting and beautifully haunting) and I liked the songs (The Hanging Tree and the meadow one). There are probably some other things that I'll update this review with once disappointment and frustration are no longer clouding my brain.I wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a page-turner that was exciting to read, but trying to finish this book felt like a chore. When reading for enjoyment starts feeling like a chore, that's the ultimate sign that I dislike the book. 90% of the book, Katniss was wandering aimlessly through hallways, drugged out on morphling, hiding in a closet, or lying in a hospital bed. I kept waiting, I was so sure it would happen any minute, for the story-changing moment when Katniss would pick herself up and say \"Enough is enough.\" I kept waiting for the moment when the winds would change and she would decide with conviction to actively work through her problems -- but to my shock, that moment never came. This book seriously dragged and dragged and dragged, and just got slower and slower until everyone started dropping dead towards the last quarter of the book. The Hunger Games, I couldn't put it down; for this, I dreaded picking it up to finish it. I did tons of things in between reading this book (doing my nails, watching TV, taking a walk, etc) because I couldn't read it in one sitting without wanting to gouge my eyes out. It was the same reoccurring theme: Katniss was manipulated and controlled by everyone around her and she didn't think or do anything of her own will. It got old.I read all this build-up and didn't get rewarded for it. And even though the rebels triumphed, I didn't feel anything for them, not relief, not happiness, just nothing. I was just detached. And none of it was thanks to Katniss: her only role in the Capitol's defeat was watching Prim die, getting burned, and waking up in a hospital, where we're TOLD instead of SHOWN how the Capitol fell (all while she was unconscious, an occurrence that's way too common in this book).Again, anti-climactic! During the scene when it really mattered!I understand the message Collins is trying to convey and I agree with it: that war is awful and no one truly wins. And good and bad are not clearly defined black and white. (It got too preachy at certain points though, didn't it?) And I understand that not all books are unicorns-and-ponies happy endings, and that this series has always been intense and dark and a bit bleak. But that only works when there's an underlying message of hope and of optimism. I felt it in the 1st books, but this ending was devoid of all hope and happiness. Yes, humans are disgusting creatures who hurt and kill one another, who do horrible things because of greed and selfishness and just pure malice. But humans are also capable of love and compassion and kindness, and I wish she'd incorporated a bit of that into the story as well so there'd be a more hopeful ending. Even in real life, no matter how bad things may be, there is always hope. Isn't that the kind of message you really want young people to be left with? Instead of pessimistic doom and \"give up on mankind\"? I finished the book feeling hopeless and lost and depressed, and not in that deep, profound way where it motivates me to get up off my ass and do something to make a difference.Gosh, at least Harry was his own person and got to face Voldemort in the end. What did Katniss get to do except be an empty canvas for them to paint and feed lines to?Though I guess since I'm feeling so passionately about all of this, it wasn't a worthless read. It was just very, VERY disappointing.Edit:I just re-read this review a month or so after I wrote it and I sincerely apologize for my sloppy writing and overindulgence in run-on sentences! I was in a rush to unleash all my feelings after finishing the book so I wouldn't forget anything. I hope this review was understandable and enjoyable anyway :)That's the end of the review and you can stop here but I wanted to add on .. and I'm thinking those who grew up with Harry Potter like I did can relate:So I decided to re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to prepare myself for the upcoming movie, and to get the bitter taste of Mockingjay out of my mouth, and here's a passage towards the end where Harry's character really touched me and left me in awe:\"Because,\" said Harry, \"sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!\"\"You're seventeen, boy!\"\"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!\"a few sentences later .. \"I'm going to keep going until I succeed -- or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.\"Reading it again makes me all emotional and teary all over again, from Dobby's heartfelt burial to Harry's courageous walk to his death in the forest, knowing fully well what awaits him and yet willing to sacrifice himself for others and for a better world ...all the while, struggling with his fears and the temptation to run away .. and I swear, tears of pride and joy sprang from my eyes and exhilaration shot through my veins when Harry, the boy we grew up with, stepped up as a man and faced his enemy with confidence, strength, wisdom.Whatever faults the last HP book may have, I just have to say: Thank you, Harry, for giving me hope again and proving there are still admirable heroes in young literature. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

About halfway through, I was ready to feed the damn thing to my dog.I'm not the biggestHunger Gamesfan. Y'all know that. However, when I readCatching Fire, after its predecessor disappointed me, I was STOKED to readMockingjay.Catching Firewas just fantastic. I really, really and truly enjoyed it.Mockingjaywas a bloodbath. If you're sensitive to pointless deaths and gratuitous violence, then this is not the book for you.Actually, I like that word.Gratuitous. It describes this book perfectly. Everything in this book was gratuitous and over the top, from the wangst to the ridiculous romantic interludes in the middle of battle scenes, and from the candy-gore violence to the stupid, overly-disgusting deaths of several characters who did not need to die. There's also the writing, which is so overwrought - it's not even like the author took the sparseness of the first book and butchered it. It's like she took the sparseness, fed it to her dog, fed the dog to a crocodile, fed the crocodile to a Tyrannosaurus rex, cut the Tyrannosaurus rex up into steaks, sold the steaks in Soho to a cabaret dancer, A-bombed the cabaret dancer's house, collected the ashes, mixed them into fluorescent paint, and then splattered the paint all over the White House in D.C. Because we, as readers who have stuck by and read the entire series through, need an entire page of Creative Writing Class explanation on what the Hanging Tree song means. It's like in the first book, when we were constantly being told exactly what the dandelions represent. And inCatching Fire, when the meaning being the clock was spelled out in an \"I AM SYMBOLISM\" manner. Everything, from Katniss's clothes (which she's weirdly fixated with) to her circular, drier-than-Egyptian-sand inner monologues were painstakingly pored over to the point of ridiculousness. Yes. Ridiculousness. Shall I repeat that again? Ridiculousness.One more time? No? Ridiculousness.Ridiculousness.Contrary to the masses, I love reading books where loads of lovable characters die in the final fight. I love going through that grief, feeling the torment of watching one of my beloved friends die a bloody death. In fact, in my own work, I have a death list. I kid you not. I literally have a list of the most beloved characters, and I've put stars in red pen against all those who die.There aremanyred stars on that list.But what I do not enjoy, and what I found far too much of inMockingjay, are pointless deaths. Deaths that don't ensure anyone else's survival, are excessively undignified, or never grieved for. Finnick, Mesalla, Mitchell, Boggs, and Cinna all died ridiculous deaths that really did nothing to aid Katniss's bringing down the Capitol. Essentially, they were all just Mauve Shirts, and they had been all along. I mean, fine. If the author wanted to kill these characters, go ahead and do it. It's actually not the fact that the characters died that bothered me. Yes, I was absolutely distraught over the death of Finnick (he just married Annie! Annie was pregnant! What the fuck kind of sadist kills that?) but given the choice myself? I'd probably kill him too. But the way in which Finnick dies is nonsensical.YA is a tricky field in which to write dystopian. True dystopian always deals with death. It always deals with untimely death, tragic lives and terrible situations in which people are abused and scarred, in any and every way. But YA is inspiring to young people. YA is a window to different ideologies and -isms held up by other people; for instance,Mockingjayis a clear message against war. But YA is also meant for a broad audience of a younger age, and that comes with a responsibility to instill a message that yes, will inspire, but coax some kind of hope out of readers. Some kind of desire to be a better person. Some kind of knowledge that there are wonderful things in the world worth salvaging, and weathering difficult patches in life will ultimately result in a brighter future.This sounds idealistic, I know. But this series is shelved in Children's. Kids as young as 12 are picking these books up, and what are they finding? The world sucks. People suck. Give up, and stop caring, because nothing good will ever come of trying. Perseverance will get you nowhere. Suicide and alcoholism will make you feel better.No.Where is Katniss? Who's the drugged-up shadow that's replaced her? InMockingjay, this fickle, doom-and-gloom girl is not the battleaxe we met inThe Hunger Games. This Katniss is constantly waking up in hospital, taking drugs and completely losing the will to fight for the people she loves. Her voice is flat, drab, full of a whole lot of wangst surrounding thelove trianglethat, during the latter half of the book, became one of the very main concerns. What? I hear a lot of guff about this not being a romance, but it's quite clear that it is. And the scene in Tigris's cellar when Katniss pretends to sleep, but actually lies awake listening to Gale and Peeta talk about how they both love her unconditionally, and are perfectly fine to let her choose who she'll pick like a carton of juice off the shelf in the supermarket, and who she'll dump on his ass? Brought back some pretty pungent T-word memories. Gale and Peeta have absolutely no self-respect, and this scene was totally unrealistic. People do not behave like that in real life. Think about it: you're sitting facing the person who you know has been fooling around with the person you wholeheartedly love, and have done for years. The person you one day see yourself marrying. Are you really going to say, \"Oh, I know how he/she feels about you. I know he/she has been making out with you behind my back, just after making out with me. I'm cool with that. I get it. No biggie.\" Don't even lie. I know that if I were Peeta or Gale, I'd be absolutely furious with Katniss. I'd demand to know why I was being toyed with, used even, and frankly? I'd walk away. I'd pick up my dignity and get out of there, because being treated like a piece of chewy candy in a pack of two that she can't decide whether or not to eat is an insult, and unspeakably degrading.I kind of wanted Katniss to end up alone. Yes, once I'd forced myself to come to terms with the fact that that wasn't going to happen, I did enjoy the last ten pages greatly. Greatly. They were quite beautiful, actually, as long as I pushed myself to suck up everything I hated about the miserable and hopeless tone of this book. What I didn't enjoy was Gale's end. What happened to him? Oh, he's in District 2. And what's he doing in Distict 2? Dunno. How did he get there? Dunno. Why did he go there? Dunno. How does he feel about Katniss being with Peeta out of default, not either one's choice? Dunno. What's he going to do with his life now? Where is he going to live? What's going to happen to this character that we've been forced upon for almost three whole books, and 1200+ pages, and who's played a huge part in the story of Katniss's life?Uh...I dunno.I also couldn't believe Katniss's trial just happened without us. What the heck? Katniss is moping and plotting her suicidegratuitouslyin her room in the Capitol, and then one day Haymitch wanders in and says, \"Your trial's over. You're free as a bird.\"Yes, Katniss is free as a bird. She goes home and lives out the rest of her days as she pleases (and her mother just buggers off too, like Gale did. Where's your mom, Katniss? \"Oh, somewhere.\").This whole thing felt like a sputtering fizzle-out of what really should have been a fantastic series. Part way throughCatching Fire, I was considering that this series may even be literary, butMockingjayspat on that. This is commercial YA, through and through. Yeah, the strong message about war and the hopelessness of Katniss tries to cover it up, but it has everything: silly love triangle, cackling villain, and the fate of the world resting on a teenager's shoulders. What's that? Oh, yeah. This is silly. Silly.Katniss's Mockingjay role was equally silly. One minute Katniss is insisting, \"I'M THE MOCKINGJAY BITCH!\" and then the next, she says that she just doesn't care about it. She doesn't care about the Mockingjay, or all the stupid TV spots they do, or anything really. And then BAM!\"I'M THE MOCKINGJAY BITCH!\"Katniss got on my nerves here. As did her constant use ofarrowsin futuristic combat. What is that? Since when was there an explosive that could fit on the head of an arrow and blow up an entire airship?Why am I even trying to reason this?The bow and arrows did not have a place in the world ofMockingjay. It seemed overwhelmingly stupid for Katniss to still be using arrows, a prehistoric weapon, when everyone else around her was using firearms and bombs. There's also the \"sheath\" business, which is just ridiculous. It literally takes 0.40 seconds to Google \"bow and arrows\" and find that arrows are held in a quiver. See? Simple!The writing in this book irritated me. The first hundred pages are almost comically boring, and the prose suffers under nonsensical fragments, run-on sentences and huge internal monologues in the middle of conversations. It's just damn hard to read.Mockingjaywas such a flop for me. While the idea of exploring PTSD in war veterans was very interesting, it was employed in such a way that it brought the narrative in this book to a painful grind. There was absolutely no hope left within Katniss, and her complete derailment just destroyed any hope left in the message of this book. The writing was irritating, the deaths pointless, the violence totally over-the-top.Mockingjaywas a great big depressingflop.Bonus Time!, error: [This just in: the movie adaptation,Mockingjay: Part 1, was absolutely outstanding.

            "Translation failed for: How do I begin to convey my disappointment? I suppose it all comes down to expectations and as mine were not met, I feel vastly underwhelmed, and a little bit devastated. When I readHungerGames, I was enthralled. I thought Katniss was intelligent, resourceful, and displayed tremendous strength in character. Moreover, Katniss’s arc appeared to parallel with the overall arc of the story/series. As Katniss grew more bold, so did the remaining characters and the uprising initiative. I expected this to continue inCatching Fire. However, Katniss appeared to stagnate, whereas the remaining characters and overall story arc continued on without her. By the end of book 2, Katniss was still in “survivor” mode, and failed to deliver anything beyond demonstration of those already proven survival instincts that we readers discovered in book 1. Nonetheless, my love forHungerGamesleft me with hope that Katniss would finally step into her role as not only a symbol of hope and rebellion against tyranny, but as a leader in an uprising that opposes oppression, and emboldens freedom of choice and will. Much to my dismay, it never occurs.Perhaps I am mistaken, but I was under the impression that this series was meant to be about revolting against a corrupt, freedom suppressing government and replacing it with a new government that not only condones freedom in all its forms, but fosters it, allowing it to thrive. For this to be an achievable story arc, Katniss has to develop into something more than a resourceful hunter, shooter of arrows, and unpredictable pawn. She has to embolden herself, as the districts have had to embolden themselves, grab her title as MockingJay by the balls, and make her own choices, cut her own path, and shoot down those who stand in her way literally and figuratively. Otherwise what is the point of revolution if the very person who made it possible doesn’t follow through?But inMockingJaywe don’t get an emboldened Katniss, we simply get more of the same, actually, we get less than the same. When Katniss isn’t hiding in closets, passed out from injuries, strung out on morphine, or walking around the compound in a near catatonic state, Katniss will exert herself in her typical yet unpredictable brash reactor form, always manipulated by those around her. She still lacks control over her life. She isn’t a warrior in the rebellion, she is a weapon, a tool, a pawn. Other times she is completely useless all-together. She is dictated to and she may or may not deliver. Where did the potential leader go I ask you?This late in the game, Katniss needed to grow as a character, to complete the story arc, if not her own character’s journey, properly. Katniss has been used to spur the other districts into revolution because she is supposed to possess strength in character as seen in the Hunger Games. She is now the face of the revolution, whether she meant to be or not. The districts have become inspired by the ball busting Katniss they perceive her to be, and it’s a lie. Turns out she isn’t opposed to being used as long as it’s people she knows calling the shots (District 13). I would have been fine with this course of events had they appeared inCatchingFire. But by the final installment, Katniss needed to be in charge of her own fate, to understand her role, to be a role model. Instead I felt as though I was reading the POV of a mentally unstable drug addict.Then there is the rebellion itself. I was expecting carnage, war, suffering, and terror seen through the eyes of our previous heroine (Katniss) and hero (Peeta). Instead we suffer through ad campaigns and one unnecessary adventure that doesn’t occur until the last portion of the book, and even that is unsatisfying with all its useless deaths (Finnick and Primm). Frankly, Finnick was the best part ofMockingJayand I couldn’t even mourn him properly as his face time was so minimal and his death so swift. But back on point, what was the purpose for Katniss’s man killing mission? Is she really so daft that she can’t see the bigger picture? Can’t she rise above baser human emotions, and the events that pertain only to her? Can’t she at least attempt to be worthy of the responsibility that has befallen her? Can’t she at least strive to earn it? And what’s most pathetic is that the revenge attempt that cost the lives of Finnick and Primm was all for nothing. Snow lives, until TB takes him. At least that’s what I assume happens, it never is very clear on how he died.But my biggest question is, why does Collins hate Peeta? When she wasn’t making him an invalid in books 1 and 2, he shined. Now in book 3 he has forgotten his love for Katniss and has been programmed by the Capital to kill her. What the hell? Why? Why not let him finally prove his worth, achieve his greatness? Why did she have to make him someone’s bitch?This book is a sham. A cop out. And it destroys the integrity of the previous books in the series. The characters fail to develop and even digress into wretched states. The ending is a crap shoot, and that epilogue was bullshit. I’m Team Peeta through and through, but I feel ripped off. Katniss didn’t choose him, she resigned herself to him because he was the one who came back for her. There was no declaration on her part, no acceptance or confession of her feelings. Peeta deserved better. We readers earned better.To those of you reviewers who will scoff at my review, claiming that this book was perfect because it was \"realistic\", I say give me a break. This series was never meant to be a war documentary. It is a Young Adult Sceince Fiction book. This book contains mutant animals and insects for Christ's sake. In what reality other than \"make believe\" does a teenager fuel a rebellion? Millions of girls adore Justin Beiber but he isn't going to become the next president. We didn't wait on pins and needles for realism. That's not why readers devoured The Hunger Games. We fell in love because the plot grabbed a hold of our minds with an enthralling story filled with worthy engaging characters. Sadly, somewhere along the way, Collins lost track of the story she was telling and got off course by deciding to get preachy. I didn't want a victim for a heroine, I wanted a victor.After two rather epic books, I expected more, these characters were worthy of more. It’s terrible what was done to them and to us for having to read it. While readingMockingJayI felt like Katniss, a pawn., error: How do I begin to convey my disappointment? I suppose it all comes down to expectations and as mine were not met, I feel vastly underwhelmed, and a little bit devastated. When I readHungerGames, I was enthralled. I thought Katniss was intelligent, resourceful, and displayed tremendous strength in character. Moreover, Katniss’s arc appeared to parallel with the overall arc of the story/series. As Katniss grew more bold, so did the remaining characters and the uprising initiative. I expected this to continue inCatching Fire. However, Katniss appeared to stagnate, whereas the remaining characters and overall story arc continued on without her. By the end of book 2, Katniss was still in “survivor” mode, and failed to deliver anything beyond demonstration of those already proven survival instincts that we readers discovered in book 1. Nonetheless, my love forHungerGamesleft me with hope that Katniss would finally step into her role as not only a symbol of hope and rebellion against tyranny, but as a leader in an uprising that opposes oppression, and emboldens freedom of choice and will. Much to my dismay, it never occurs.Perhaps I am mistaken, but I was under the impression that this series was meant to be about revolting against a corrupt, freedom suppressing government and replacing it with a new government that not only condones freedom in all its forms, but fosters it, allowing it to thrive. For this to be an achievable story arc, Katniss has to develop into something more than a resourceful hunter, shooter of arrows, and unpredictable pawn. She has to embolden herself, as the districts have had to embolden themselves, grab her title as MockingJay by the balls, and make her own choices, cut her own path, and shoot down those who stand in her way literally and figuratively. Otherwise what is the point of revolution if the very person who made it possible doesn’t follow through?But inMockingJaywe don’t get an emboldened Katniss, we simply get more of the same, actually, we get less than the same. When Katniss isn’t hiding in closets, passed out from injuries, strung out on morphine, or walking around the compound in a near catatonic state, Katniss will exert herself in her typical yet unpredictable brash reactor form, always manipulated by those around her. She still lacks control over her life. She isn’t a warrior in the rebellion, she is a weapon, a tool, a pawn. Other times she is completely useless all-together. She is dictated to and she may or may not deliver. Where did the potential leader go I ask you?This late in the game, Katniss needed to grow as a character, to complete the story arc, if not her own character’s journey, properly. Katniss has been used to spur the other districts into revolution because she is supposed to possess strength in character as seen in the Hunger Games. She is now the face of the revolution, whether she meant to be or not. The districts have become inspired by the ball busting Katniss they perceive her to be, and it’s a lie. Turns out she isn’t opposed to being used as long as it’s people she knows calling the shots (District 13). I would have been fine with this course of events had they appeared inCatchingFire. But by the final installment, Katniss needed to be in charge of her own fate, to understand her role, to be a role model. Instead I felt as though I was reading the POV of a mentally unstable drug addict.Then there is the rebellion itself. I was expecting carnage, war, suffering, and terror seen through the eyes of our previous heroine (Katniss) and hero (Peeta). Instead we suffer through ad campaigns and one unnecessary adventure that doesn’t occur until the last portion of the book, and even that is unsatisfying with all its useless deaths (Finnick and Primm). Frankly, Finnick was the best part ofMockingJayand I couldn’t even mourn him properly as his face time was so minimal and his death so swift. But back on point, what was the purpose for Katniss’s man killing mission? Is she really so daft that she can’t see the bigger picture? Can’t she rise above baser human emotions, and the events that pertain only to her? Can’t she at least attempt to be worthy of the responsibility that has befallen her? Can’t she at least strive to earn it? And what’s most pathetic is that the revenge attempt that cost the lives of Finnick and Primm was all for nothing. Snow lives, until TB takes him. At least that’s what I assume happens, it never is very clear on how he died.But my biggest question is, why does Collins hate Peeta? When she wasn’t making him an invalid in books 1 and 2, he shined. Now in book 3 he has forgotten his love for Katniss and has been programmed by the Capital to kill her. What the hell? Why? Why not let him finally prove his worth, achieve his greatness? Why did she have to make him someone’s bitch?This book is a sham. A cop out.

            "Translation failed for: I really wish I could say this is an amazing book, worthy of so much thoughtful praises, etc., but that would just be a lie. Given how much I enjoy good writing—and this book definitely has it all, like a beautifully crafted essay that speaks with prominent characters and conflicts between generations of families—it’s kind of weird for me to say this book is just okay. I mean, the only thing I like from this entire book is the language: the metaphors, descriptions, the lines that sound so poetic and true, and the impressive vocabulary. Everything else? Not so much.Storyline. Absolutelyhatehow the story shifts like a timeline of generations. It makes sense that it would cover the entire family from grandfather to granddaughter since it’s a family story, but I hate how little time we get to spend with each character before s/he is whisked off to some other place, and only to return whenever the author feels like it. (That how it looks like to me.) Each chapter is almost devoted to just one or two characters, and I find it really tiring, especially when it’s all about relationships and love that I haven’t really figured out why it exists. It’s written at a speed that makes the character’s love story seem kind of random.It’s like what I say about the protagonist falling in love with her best friend: when readers start the story, they’re just given the fact that they’ve been through a lot and have been best friends forever, so of course they fall in love. But readers don’t get to see that process, and it’s frustrating to see the point they’re making when the viewers are just like, “Yeah, okay, if you say so.” So the protagonists don’t fall in love with their best friends in this book, but they might as well have. Take Pedro Tercero and Blanca, for instance. Love at first sight. Whoop-de-do. First of all, clichéd. Second of all, no development. Love at first sight is pretty explanatory itself, but how the heck did they grow to love each other so much? One minute, they’re children, the next paragraph; they’re teens trying to express themselves. I hate that we just have to take the basic “Oh, they fell in love the first time they curled up against each other” from the author without really questioning how it happened or why it’s developed into some life-and-death scenario later. I can’t handle reading a relationship that doesn’t express itself in a deeper stand and instead, just tells you, yes, they love each other, yes, they are willing to do for each other, yes, they are having wild and passionate sex. So what if they do all of that? It’s the chemistry and direct message that I will interpret that matters.Of course, if it was just one couple, I could handle. But the sad thing is that the same goes for Clara and Esteban. Maybe it’s the time period, but the author likes to play with the love at first sight story. That’s how Esteban fell for Clara. And Clara was only in it because of her vision, which makes me more frustrated. If you can see the future, why not change it? For a character that seems pretty strong—yet identified as fragile and beautiful, of all the freaking adjectives to describe women!—she lacks what I hope for in a protagonist. Isabel Allende tries to make her manner seem so unorganized and magical realism that she comes off rather cold and unconvincing. And the fact that she hardly talks, not just her character and her mute phases but the dialogue in the book itself (really, the only one who actually says things throughout the book in conversation form would be Esteban and Transito. I felt they talked more than husband and wife. Ironic much?). Seeing as how they’ve spent years and years together, you’d think I, as a reader, could seesomethingpresent in their relationship, some sort of depth or attraction, but nope, nothing. I mean, I saw a spark in his relationship with a prostitute rather than Clara, which is just wrong. And, the only one who’s real in here is Esteban, but too bad I find him and his actions revolting. If I were to rate him on a personality scale, it’d be negative, negative 1. In this case, two negatives don’t make a positive, people.Still continuing with the storyline, I find the political stuff just plain boring. I hate how we’re required to read books that not only talk about religion (like Christianity, which is really getting boring by now. How many more discussion topics about this can I handle before I start to scream?) but also politics. I don’t mind if the authors throw it in here and there, but to put all her characters involved with government conflict? It makes the story so predictable (because it is. You don’t politics never end well) and you know we will all spend a day or two talking about the different sides they’re taking and what a big theme it is. I’m just like, yeah, okay, whatever. I don’t want to end up having to look up the political references that the book mentioned to understand it all, and I don’t want a book that puts so much pressure on generations of families just because they don’t agree with each other. It’s bad enough that people are so passionate about that stuff, when others would very much like to just leave it at whatever’s best for the country, and still find something annoying in a work of fiction. With this topic, it threatens the characters and changes their personalities. Instead of being natural people, they get portrayed as good citizens who want to fight for what they believe in. We all know most people wouldn’t do that. Take the Holocaust, for instance. How much people stood up for Jews then? If I’m reading about a character that has journeyedintothis political standing/situation, then I have nothing to complain about. But nope, not the case.It’s also not about the storyline, but how messed up the characters and the people are. It drives me crazy how the author, out of the blue, tells you what can be expected somewhere down the road. I want to be amazed, shocked, and not told what’s going to happen. (One example would be when Amanda’s picking up Miguel from school and says something about dying for him. Then, the author jumps in with, little did she know that she would have to one day. Random!) And it also makes me nuts whenever characters appear and disappear. Like Transito. She appears early on in the book and vanishes until Esteban’s lust kicks in. And finally, she helps him. Or the Moira Sisters—I can’t even remember the significance they had, just that they were like Clara the Clairvoyant. Oh, just the tiniest thing can frustrate me about this book. I haven’t found one single character that I like. They’re all pigs/rapists, or poor fragile women who can’t stand up for themselves, with the exception of Alba. She realizes in the end that she can’t give up, but the whole pregnancy and don’t know who the father is makes me grimace.I hate how every generation is about sadness, and how everything bad that can happen, happens to the Trueba/Del Valle family. But that’s story-telling for you, just not realistic.On a final note, even though it couldn’t have been more than a few weeks, it seemed like I’d been reading this book for months, and those months just dragged on and on, especially since I had the old issue of the book where the pages were yellow and smelled like moth balls and some other unidentifiable thing.The rating: I would have given it 1 star, but the writing was good, so I decided to be nice., error: I really wish I could say this is an amazing book, worthy of so much thoughtful praises, etc., but that would just be a lie.

It’s bad enough that people are so passionate about that stuff, when others would very much like to just leave it at whatever’s best for the country, and still find something annoying in a work of fiction. With this topic, it threatens the characters and changes their personalities. Instead of being natural people, they get portrayed as good citizens who want to fight for what they believe in. We all know most people wouldn’t do that. Take the Holocaust, for instance. How much people stood up for Jews then? If I’m reading about a character that has journeyedintothis political standing/situation, then I have nothing to complain about. But nope, not the case.It’s also not about the storyline, but how messed up the characters and the people are. It drives me crazy how the author, out of the blue, tells you what can be expected somewhere down the road. I want to be amazed, shocked, and not told what’s going to happen. (One example would be when Amanda’s picking up Miguel from school and says something about dying for him. Then, the author jumps in with, little did she know that she would have to one day. Random!) And it also makes me nuts whenever characters appear and disappear. Like Transito. She appears early on in the book and vanishes until Esteban’s lust kicks in. And finally, she helps him. Or the Moira Sisters—I can’t even remember the significance they had, just that they were like Clara the Clairvoyant. Oh, just the tiniest thing can frustrate me about this book. I haven’t found one single character that I like. They’re all pigs/rapists, or poor fragile women who can’t stand up for themselves, with the exception of Alba. She realizes in the end that she can’t give up, but the whole pregnancy and don’t know who the father is makes me grimace.I hate how every generation is about sadness, and how everything bad that can happen, happens to the Trueba/Del Valle family. But that’s story-telling for you, just not realistic.On a final note, even though it couldn’t have been more than a few weeks, it seemed like I’d been reading this book for months, and those months just dragged on and on, especially since I had the old issue of the book where the pages were yellow and smelled like moth balls and some other unidentifiable thing.The rating: I would have given it 1 star, but the writing was good, so I decided to be nice. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: I started reading this book and a curious thing happened. Suddenly my house was sparkling clean, my bills were filed away, I started playing Farm Story and reached level 13 in one day, I did my tax, I spent two hours chatting to the chatbott, Jabberwocky...Anything, and I mean ANYTHING to avoid the boredom of reading Shiver. Shiver, the story of a girl drastically into beastiality, only to find out her wolf lover was really a boy. As I read this book I had the strange urge to lock up my German sheppard should Grace ever decide to visit my home because she really does fall in love with a dog... for YEARS before she ever finds out it's a boy or that things like werewolves exist. I can't even begin to express how creepy her obsession with a wolf is.I get the whole eternal love thing. Perhaps Stiefvater was trying to show that Sam and Grace's connection transcends all the things love actually isn't supposed to transcend. Maybe I'm just weird and completely unromantic, but I've never looked at Fido and found a kindred spirit. I never passed a dog down the street and found that I couldn't be attracted to men because they just weren't going to cut it for me anymore.So, other than the fact that this book disturbed the fucking hell out of me, bored me to death and dragged on like a visit to the old folk's home, it was also poorly edited. The writing wasn't TOO bad. Some of the poems were down right rubbish, and some of the others were alright.Grace and Sam's voices were near identical. Oh, and another thing, Sam was annoyingly chaste for way too long. Where were all of these careful, thoughtful boys when I was in high school? It's a disturbing trend, really. Edward Cullen, Sam Roth, Daniel Gregori... they all came pre-pussy whipped and I'm kind of wondering what the attraction is.Maybe I'm just a sucker for bad boys. Maybe I like boys that I COULDN'T imagine comfortably playing bridge with my 80 year old grandma (not to mention enjoying it!) What is with the sudden need to keep us women in line? If I read one more paranormal, male hunk refuse the supposed love of his life, who is literally flinging her naked body onto him, then I think I'm going to start a convention... a Ball Replacement Convention.C'mon, Stiefvater! Give the boy his balls back, please! He complained that a jacket made him look bulky! He wrote a poem about a leaking womb! What teenage boy doesn't shudder at the thought of menstrual blood? What next? Chipped nail, PMS cramps? Is he going to stamp his foot and mutter, \"Drat! I can't believe Jennifer is wearing the same dress as me! I think I might just die!\"Look, I know I'm being incredibly sexist. After all, it was kind of nice to read about a \"stoic\" female character and an emotional, gentle male character. But Sam felt and read far too much like a middle aged woman and not like a teenage boy. I didn't feel like he was well characterized or fleshed out enough.So all in all, I can't muster the energy to rant about this book. It was REALLY boring. It was average on the writing scale. It's secondary characterization was pretty good but the main characters didn't do it for me. The plot was SLOW.Her parents were stupid. I could complain that they were unrealistic - but I've met some fucked up parents over my life, so I'll buy that they really could be that moronic. What I will complain about is where they get this amazing and varied social life in a small town. It never explains why Sam's fate is mysteriously different to Jack's. Maybe I'm just stupid... No. I don't buy that. Was it because he was out in the freezing cold so it kept his temperature reasonable? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of giving him a crazy-ass fever? Was it actually because he processed it as a wolf? Well that doesn't make sense because Grace never changed.And what's with the dramatic ending? Really? He gets cured and goes home and gets dressed and reads a few books, checks his mail, gives himself a mani and a pedi, goes on a diet, waits for his skin to clear up, buys the perfect set of shoes and THEN tracks down the love of his life who he thought he'd never see again? I DON'T FUCKING THINK SO! How about stumbling through the forest naked and desperately arriving in Grace's backyard because he can't believe the complete miracle of his cure and can't wait to have the love of his life back in his arms? Yeah, that ending makes so much more sense.I don't get why this is popular. But then, I don't get why Fallen is popular either. It's just all beyond me. Now I'm off to see if I can cram the word \"balls\" into this review anymore.Balls, balls, balls. Oh my goodness she fell in love with a dog! Balls.Balls.This review can also be found on my blog,Cuddlebuggery Book Blog., error: Zaczęłam czytać tę książkę i wydarzyło się coś dziwnego. Nagle mój dom lśnił czystością, rachunki zostały odłożone, zaczęłam grać w Farm Story i osiągnęłam 13 poziom w ciągu jednego dnia, rozliczyłam podatki, spędziłam dwie godziny na czatowaniu z chatbotem, Jabberwocky... Cokolwiek, i mam na myśli COKOLWIEK, aby uniknąć nudy czytania Shiver. Shiver, historia dziewczyny drastycznie wkraczającej w zoofilię, tylko po to, aby dowiedzieć się, że jej wilczy kochanek był tak naprawdę chłopcem. Kiedy czytałam tę książkę, miałam dziwną ochotę zamknąć mojego owczarka niemieckiego, gdyby Grace kiedykolwiek zdecydowała się odwiedzić mój dom, ponieważ ona naprawdę zakochuje się w psie... przez LATA, zanim w ogóle dowiaduje się, że to chłopiec lub że istnieją takie rzeczy jak wilkołaki. Nie potrafię nawet zacząć wyrażać, jak przerażająca jest jej obsesja na punkcie wilka. Rozumiem całą tę wieczną miłość. Być może Stiefvater próbowała pokazać, że więź Sama i Grace wykracza poza wszystko, czego miłość tak naprawdę nie powinna wykraczać. Może jestem po prostu dziwna i zupełnie nieromantyczna, ale nigdy nie spojrzałam na Fido i nie znalazłam bratniej duszy. Nigdy nie minęłam psa na ulicy i nie odkryłam, że nie mogę być pociągana do mężczyzn, ponieważ po prostu nie byli już dla mnie wystarczająco dobrzy. Więc poza tym, że ta książka mnie cholernie rozwaliła, zanudziła na śmierć i ciągnęła się jak wizyta w domu starców, była też źle zredagowana. Styl pisania nie był ZBYT zły. Niektóre wiersze były po prostu do bani, a niektóre inne były w porządku. Głosy Grace i Sama były niemal identyczne. Och, i jeszcze jedno, Sam był irytująco czysty przez zdecydowanie za długi czas. Gdzie byli wszyscy ci ostrożni, zamyśleni chłopcy, kiedy byłam w liceum? To naprawdę niepokojący trend. Edward Cullen, Sam Roth, Daniel Gregori... wszyscy byli jeszcze przed cipką wychłostani i zastanawiam się, co jest w tym pociągającego. Może po prostu jestem frajerem na złych chłopców. Może lubię chłopaków, których NIE WYOBRAZIŁABYM sobie komfortowo grających w brydża z moją 80-letnią babcią (nie wspominając o czerpaniu z tego przyjemności!). Co jest z tą nagłą potrzebą trzymania nas, kobiet, w ryzach? Jeśli przeczytam jeszcze jednego paranormalnego, męskiego przystojniaka odrzucającego rzekomą miłość swojego życia, która dosłownie rzuca na niego swoje nagie ciało, to chyba zacznę konwencję... konwencję wymiany piłek. No dalej, Stiefvater! Oddajcie chłopakowi jego jaja, proszę! Narzekał, że kurtka sprawia, że ​​wygląda na grubego! Napisał wiersz o przeciekającym łonie! Który nastolatek nie wzdryga się na myśl o krwi menstruacyjnej? Co dalej? Odpryskany paznokieć, skurcze PMS? Czy tupnie nogą i wymamrocze: „Do licha! Nie mogę uwierzyć, że Jennifer ma na sobie tę samą sukienkę co ja! Chyba po prostu umrę!” Słuchajcie, wiem, że jestem niesamowicie seksistowska. W końcu całkiem miło było przeczytać o „stoickiej” postaci kobiecej i emocjonalnym, łagodnym męskim charakterze. Ale Sam czuł się i czytał o wiele bardziej jak kobieta w średnim wieku niż jak nastolatek. Nie czułem, że był dobrze scharakteryzowany lub wystarczająco rozwinięty. Więc ogólnie rzecz biorąc, nie mogę zebrać energii, aby narzekać na tę książkę. Była NAPRAWDĘ nudna. Była przeciętna w skali pisania. Jej drugoplanowa charakterystyka była całkiem dobra, ale główni bohaterowie nie zrobili tego dla mnie. Fabuła była WOLNA. Jej rodzice byli głupi. Mogłem narzekać, że byli nierealni - ale spotkałem kilku popieprzonych rodziców w swoim życiu, więc wierzę, że naprawdę mogli być aż tak idiotyczni. Na co będę narzekał, to skąd mają to niesamowite i różnorodne życie towarzyskie w małym miasteczku. Nigdy nie wyjaśnia, dlaczego los Sama jest tajemniczo inny niż los Jacka. Może po prostu jestem głupi... Nie. Nie wierzę w to. Czy to dlatego, że był na mrozie, więc utrzymywało to jego temperaturę na rozsądnym poziomie? Czy to nie zniweczyłoby celu wywołania u niego szalonej gorączki? Czy to naprawdę dlatego, że przetwarzał ją jako wilk? Cóż, to nie ma sensu, bo Grace nigdy się nie zmieniła. A co z tym dramatycznym zakończeniem? Naprawdę? Wyleczył się, wrócił do domu, ubrał się, przeczytał kilka książek, sprawdził pocztę, zrobił sobie manicure i pedicure, przeszedł na dietę, czekał, aż jego skóra się oczyściła, kupił idealną parę butów, a POTEM odnalazł miłość swojego życia, której myślał, że już nigdy nie zobaczy? KURWA NIE SĄDZĘ! Co powiecie na to, żeby potykając się nago po lesie i rozpaczliwie docierając na podwórko Grace, bo nie mógł uwierzyć w całkowity cud swojego wyleczenia i nie mógł się doczekać, aż miłość swojego życia znów będzie w jego ramionach? Tak, to zakończenie ma o wiele więcej sensu. Nie rozumiem, dlaczego to jest popularne. Ale nie rozumiem też, dlaczego Fallen jest popularne. To wszystko mnie przerasta. Teraz idę sprawdzić, czy uda mi się jeszcze wcisnąć słowo „jaja” do tej recenzji. Jaja, jaja, jaja. O mój Boże, zakochała się w psie! Jaja. Jaja.

            "Translation failed for: 2.5. It was really only alright.A little fact about me is I’m not a vampire person, or a witch person, or a people person (I’m not entirely sure where this is going, but it sounds quite personal). The last paranormal romance series I read was the Twilight saga after my parents told me I couldn’t read it (I did anyway.) So, I genuinely cannot count the years since I’ve touched a book like this. And I’m not a werewolf person either, for that matter. I don’t tend to fantasise about a boy who may want to eat me while kissing me or being The Alpha, or whatever those books entail (these are such judgey stereotypes, I’m so sorry.)So why did I pick up Shiver? Well, I’d better not go into the whirlwind of an affair I had with Steifvater this year, but I can say her writing has always stood out to me, and the plot line had my interest. Sam, an eighteen-year-old boy, shifts into a wolf each winter due to the cold. Every year his time as a human gets shorter until he’s certain this one will be his last. Grace was attacked by wolves as a child until he saved her, and since then she’s been longing to be with her wolf ever since…Okay, okay, I know this sounds stupid, but I was honestly more intrigued by the concept of the wolves being completely isolated from humanity and how Grace/Sam’s relationship was affected by that. Did I get that? Eh, not really. There werewolf mythology was kind of murky which was disappointing to say the least. The supernatural aspect got pushed aside for the romance, and God, if there wasn’t a lot of it.This book is Different From Other Books because this book doesn’t even contain instalove. Instead it has the equally unrealistic, probably creepier, prenatal love (even the name sounds weird) Since Sam saved Grace, she’s been in love with him. Like really in love with him. The kind of love that makes her wish she was a wolf and refer to a wolf as “her wolf”, in a soulmates way despite only thinking he was a wolf at the time. When it’s believed a wolf has killed another boy and the police go to hunt them down, Grace stops the hunt, because “her wolf”, y’know.A lot of readers love soulmates, but they just don’t work for me. I think love has to be earned before being given, and maybe people can grow into the role of soulmates, just not that fast. And one of the bigger downfalls of the book was when I realised exactlyhowmuch Grace thinks about her wolf, to the point she would clearly put it’s safety before her friends and family.The characters…I didn’t entirely hate. They didn’t feel like teenagers, probably a more middle-aged couple, but I didn’t detest them as much as other reviewers. Grace, I liked less than Sam, probably because of how she treated others. Sam/ Her Wolf always came first to her, and even if Sam wasn’t involved, she was still quite rude to her friends and family, only using them when convenient. And her “woe is me” story revolved around her parents not paying her enough attention, even though they were still more involved than 90% of YA parents we see these days and back in those days. At one stage, Grace’s mother even offers to watch a movie together and Grace is like “nope, you could’ve done this five years ago. My boyfriend lives in my bedroom now, so I am removed from this family. ”Luckily, Grace’s parents don’t seem to take notice of her attitude, so I was happy for them, at least.Sam equally sappy, but he wasn’t awful either. A weird number of reviews seem to think it’s strange that Sam has “feminine” qualities (He reads poetry, he plays guitar, can cook a little) and honestly I think it’s a product of the time. I’d like to believe in 2020 that we’re past cornering men and women into stereotypes, though we’re probably nowhere near it. If Sam’s boring? Then he’s boring. But I wouldn’t mark a character down just because they’re more open with their emotions and their interests don’t adhere to tradition.(What will never stop being funny to me is if a main character who reads poetry, they must make up their own. I laughed every time Sam like looked at Grace and would think “here’s a totally weird, unrelated poem I just wrote.” And he wrote riffs too! Like he’d actually think of jazzy little tunes when they were feeling each other up. What made it worse was I couldn’t stop thinking of a specific Nirvana riff which made me laugh even harder. Note to authors: Please stop making your characters write poetry. Theirs/yours, isn’t even good.)As usual, the supporting cast stood out more. Jack, the angry boy who’s been turned, Isabel his snappy sister, Beck, Sam’s leader who’s also into his final year. I probably would’ve been more interested in one of their stories, but it’s fine, guys, we got prenatal love! (shudshivers)That’s by far the biggest downfall. Since this book focused on Love….it was pretty boring and dragged for about seventy percent. The first hundred pages I was like “wow, things are being done quickly.” Then the next two hundred pages were Sam and Grace talking, driving places, you don’t need me to elaborate. I’m either very lucky, or unlucky, that I don’t get bothered by books that drag. No matter the book, I will be fine floating along, even if it’s mind-numbing. But I could see this being a DNF for a lot of people, especially if you hate instalove/prenatal/ love in general. People who might like the wolf aspect….I wouldn’t recommend it. When the wolf stuff was on the page, it was interesting. But the wolf stuff wasn’t on the page most of the book, so = not interesting!(I can say I liked some of the ideas though, especially that it was the cold that caused them to change, and one year, they just won't be able to return to human form and will live as a wolf forever.)So, it it has a glacial pace, iffy romance, “old soul leads” and lack of plot/wolves, why did I give it three stars? Well, the writing and the ending were quite beautiful to be honest. Number one, well it’s Maggie Stiefvater, so that’s not a surprise. But, and I may be a hypocrite in saying this, when you’re compressed in a relationship with some characters over a long span of time, you grow attached to them. And this book was only about Grace and Sam, so there was nothing else to cling to. Despite my earlier criticisms, maybe Maggie was aware of what she was doing and knew I’d maybe care for them somewhat in the end. The conclusions for Olive and Beck left me staring at the page with a strange feeling for several minutes. The same with Jack, who like I said, I would’ve read more about. And the last few pages – can I say I understand exactly why this book had so many fans, other than the Twilight craze? It was actually quite sweet. It gave me that otherworldly feeling that only reading contains, that I'm living a life outside myself, and I can't describe how nice that is when it happens, especially in a book you don't expect.So, yes, this book is mostly cloying and uninteresting. If you like instalove, you will love this. If you don’t, you’d best give it a miss. But I don’t think any book I’ve ever read has been a waste of time. And, with the last one hundred pages, I can say I’ll take a little bit of this one with me too., error: 2.5.

            "Translation failed for: Someone please tell meThe Raven Boysis nothing like this book. Or else Stiefvater and I are done.When you pick up your first book by an insanely popular author, you naturally have some expectations. Or at least expect a good story. But this was bizarre and so Twilight-esque, I could hardly try convincing myself that it would end better.The only redeemable quality was the writing.And the only reason I picked up this book in the first place was Sam, the male lead. He’s apparently my fictional boyfriend according to some Book Matchmaker challenge I took part in. Safe to say we’ve broken up. Or rather, I ditched him.There are going to be **MINOR SPOILERS** ahead, but that shouldn’t matter because you aren’t going to read this book anyway amiright?Let me give you a few reasons not to pick up this book –1. The PlotGrace was bitten by some wolves in the woods near her house when she was six. One of them supposedly saved her, and she has been inlovewith him ever since. Turns out, the wolf is not merely a wolf, but a werewolf. A boy in Grace’s class was murdered by the wolves, which puts them in imminent danger. Grace is overcome with a fiery need to protect them, especiallyherwolf, and find a way to stay with him forever.•\tFor some reason,I had a really uncomfortable time reading this book.At first I thought, it was because I wasn’t a fan of werewolves, but then I realized I had read and loved books on these shape shifters. Then I thought about the plot and it dawned on me how insanelyunrealistic and grossit actually was.For six years, Grace is intrigued by a damn WOLF, even before she realized it was a werewolf.OMG I’m puking.•\tAlso, near to the end of the book, the plot takes this stupid turn, where the main characters search for a cure for werewolves to stop turning into wolves. The thing is, the werewolves in this book aren’t affected by moonlight, but rather by temperature changes. Cold temperature means wolf, warm means human. And the cure they come up with is THIS – inject the blood of a meningitis infected person to induce fever, and therefore - high temperature to the werewolf while they’re human. YOU DON’T EVEN NEED ME TO TELL YOU JUST HOW SICK AND GROSS AND STUPID AND DOWNRIGHT CRAZY THAT IS!!! Meningitis is very dangerous. Not to mention, contagious. And just transfusing some random blood from a stranger to three people.?? You should at least know some basic science kids! BIG PLOTHOLE THERE.•\tLike I said, the werewolves, while human, cannot stand cold temperatures without changing. Most of the book takes place in winter, or at night, while the temperature is low, so Sam and other werewolves are usually inside – rooms, cars, and the like. What felt weird to me wasthe way Sam ran back and forth the cars and shops and houses.Like, they would open the window slightly and he would start shivering, indicating change. But then, he would also open the door and run to the house, and even go on night excursions this way. It’s hard to explain, butthat looks utterly stupid in my imagination.Like, open the door – run to the car – open door again – run to the shop. How cool is that?•\tEverything said, this book is once again,a version of Twilight. Minus the vampires. I would actually go ahead and say thatTwilight was better.Because, Edward vs. Sam?Edward.He’s hotter. Bella vs. Grace?Bella.She’s tolerable at least. Edward-Bella vs. Sam-Grace?Edward-Bella.Better chemistry.Also, Twilight is better crafted than Shiver, because heck, where was the plot here? Even then, the similarities are uncanny.2. The CharactersEek. Firstly, I think even the humans here are inhuman. And the werewolves are just fine. There is just something NOT-Normal about these characters. They are all one-dimensional, in the truest sense of the word. Like, one person is assigned a certain trait which they carry off throughout the book. It is one of the factors that make this book flat and unfelt.•\tGRACEOne of the narrators, Grace is very unlikeable. She is hardcore obsessed by the wolves in the woods near her house, even when they become the reasons for one of her classmates death!Heck, she even blames that guy for dying, because it putherdear wolves indangerof being hunted down by the police.WT*?She is also rude to her parents, her best friends, and to just about everyone in general except Sam. For an instance, Isabel was so friendly to her, but she never ever considered her the same way. She never says SORRY, even when she’s wrong. And her love-at-first-sight is just creepy and sick. She also wants to turn into a werewolf, sheregretsnot changing. Huh, seriously? Why not let Sam or someone else bite you then?•\tSAMThe second narrator, Sam is a confusing character. I mean, he is not unbearable. Certainly not as much as Grace. And his creepy obsession with Grace seems far more reasonable. But his characterization was pathetic. His tone felt like a girl’s. He could have been Samantha for all I know. And the attempt to make him Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes didn’t work with me either.•\tISABELThe only likeable character for me. She was quirky, witty, charming at times, and her keen nature made me like her instantly. But she too suffers from the one-dimensional plague that has infected all our characters. And yet, Isabel makes you root for her.The rest of the characters aren’t even that developed that I can write about. For example, Jack and Beck were mentioned so many times but we got to see them very rarely it makes you feel like they’re not even there. At least, they are spared from my critics. Good for them.3. The RomanceNot worth it. Just not worth it. Haven’t read of such a creepy disturbing romance in recent times. Oh yes, they made a cute pair, probably. But their insta-love and romance weren’t droolworthy or anything romantic, onlydisgusting.I don’t know what my problem with it is. I was even okay with Bella and Jacob, but here the context is different, the world id different, the werewolves are different. It just makes me sick to think of a girl romancing a boy who was essentially destined to turn into and die a wolf. Oh no. NO.4. The WritingIt’s witty and sarcastic. And pleasant to read. Also, fitting for the atmospheric setup of the book. Not exceptional by any means, though you can feel the potential. But even the generic writing style couldn’t save the non-existent plot.Even after all this, you still want to read this book, I say go for it. If you’re a die-hard fan of Twilight, I say go for it. Else if you’re any bit like me and cannot tolerate any form of bestiality, I say, don’t approach this book at all. Stay 10 feet away from it ALWAYS. Yeah? Yeah., error: Someone please tell meThe Raven Boysis nothing like this book. Or else Stiefvater and I are done.When you pick up your first book by an insanely popular author, you naturally have some expectations. Or at least expect a good story. But this was bizarre and so Twilight-esque, I could hardly try convincing myself that it would end better.The only redeemable quality was the writing.And the only reason I picked up this book in the first place was Sam, the male lead. He’s apparently my fictional boyfriend according to some Book Matchmaker challenge I took part in. Safe to say we’ve broken up. Or rather, I ditched him.There are going to be **MINOR SPOILERS** ahead, but that shouldn’t matter because you aren’t going to read this book anyway amiright?Let me give you a few reasons not to pick up this book –1. The PlotGrace was bitten by some wolves in the woods near her house when she was six. One of them supposedly saved her, and she has been inlovewith him ever since. Turns out, the wolf is not merely a wolf, but a werewolf. A boy in Grace’s class was murdered by the wolves, which puts them in imminent danger. Grace is overcome with a fiery need to protect them, especiallyherwolf, and find a way to stay with him forever.•\tFor some reason,I had a really uncomfortable time reading this book.At first I thought, it was because I wasn’t a fan of werewolves, but then I realized I had read and loved books on these shape shifters. Then I thought about the plot and it dawned on me how insanelyunrealistic and grossit actually was.For six years, Grace is intrigued by a damn WOLF, even before she realized it was a werewolf.OMG I’m puking.•\tAlso, near to the end of the book, the plot takes this stupid turn, where the main characters search for a cure for werewolves to stop turning into wolves. The thing is, the werewolves in this book aren’t affected by moonlight, but rather by temperature changes. Cold temperature means wolf, warm means human. And the cure they come up with is THIS – inject the blood of a meningitis infected person to induce fever, and therefore - high temperature to the werewolf while they’re human. YOU DON’T EVEN NEED ME TO TELL YOU JUST HOW SICK AND GROSS AND STUPID AND DOWNRIGHT CRAZY THAT IS!!! Meningitis is very dangerous. Not to mention, contagious. And just transfusing some random blood from a stranger to three people.?? You should at least know some basic science kids! BIG PLOTHOLE THERE.•\tLike I said, the werewolves, while human, cannot stand cold temperatures without changing. Most of the book takes place in winter, or at night, while the temperature is low, so Sam and other werewolves are usually inside – rooms, cars, and the like. What felt weird to me wasthe way Sam ran back and forth the cars and shops and houses.Like, they would open the window slightly and he would start shivering, indicating change. But then, he would also open the door and run to the house, and even go on night excursions this way. It’s hard to explain, butthat looks utterly stupid in my imagination.Like, open the door – run to the car – open door again – run to the shop. How cool is that?•\tEverything said, this book is once again,a version of Twilight. Minus the vampires. I would actually go ahead and say thatTwilight was better.Because, Edward vs. Sam?Edward.He’s hotter. Bella vs. Grace?Bella.She’s tolerable at least. Edward-Bella vs. Sam-Grace?Edward-Bella.Better chemistry.Also, Twilight is better crafted than Shiver, because heck, where was the plot here? Even then, the similarities are uncanny.2. The CharactersEek. Firstly, I think even the humans here are inhuman. And the werewolves are just fine. There is just something NOT-Normal about these characters. They are all one-dimensional, in the truest sense of the word. Like, one person is assigned a certain trait which they carry off throughout the book. It is one of the factors that make this book flat and unfelt.•\tGRACEOne of the narrators, Grace is very unlikeable. She is hardcore obsessed by the wolves in the woods near her house, even when they become the reasons for one of her classmates death!Heck, she even blames that guy for dying, because it putherdear wolves indangerof being hunted down by the police.WT*?She is also rude to her parents, her best friends, and to just about everyone in general except Sam. For an instance, Isabel was so friendly to her, but she never ever considered her the same way. She never says SORRY, even when she’s wrong. And her love-at-first-sight is just creepy and sick. She also wants to turn into a werewolf, sheregretsnot changing. Huh, seriously? Why not let Sam or someone else bite you then?•\tSAMThe second narrator, Sam is a confusing character. I mean, he is not unbearable. Certainly not as much as Grace. And his creepy obsession with Grace seems far more reasonable. But his characterization was pathetic. His tone felt like a girl’s.

            "Translation failed for: We have the freedom to express our opinions in beauty of subjectivity, and we should always fight and bite to keep that.But that's not the case I'm trying to make here with this review.I’m not trying to challenge anyone’s opinion or common sense when I say that by all measures of literature in history of mankind – and what paved the way for books, movies, songs we today call classics to be considered as such because of their unique quality – The Way of Kings(as well as its far worse sequel: Words of Radiance)is one of the worst books ever written.I tried as much as I could to share my thoughts in a thoughtful and respectful manner for all of you who love this book.And I believe that I do have an actual position (as an admirer of fantasy genre) that I feel obliged to argue.Especially when I see a problem.OK?OK.Onto the actual review, then.The only book I’ve read more times than this one wasLeo Tolstoy’s War and Peace.And the reason why I read War and Peace so many times was because upon each read I discovered something new that would grip me in Leo’s story; a new character and their perspectives I overlooked or experienced in a different way every other time I took the book in my hands.A true masterpiece and a classic that rightfully stands against the time, in spite being written well over a century ago.Am I actually trying to draw a comparison between War and Peace and The Way of Kings?God, no!The only similarity these two books have, luckily, is that both are just that – books.In everything else they fail in comparison.But, I have seen many people calling The Way of Kings both a masterpiece and an instant classic of the genre.I admit, on my first two reads, I was inclined to agree. I understand all of you who think and say that.Because I was one of you. I was enamored and infatuated by scope and magnitude of what I was reading.I never thought that someone could make a story where people are fighting over a heart of a giant crab and make it sound serious.I never thought that you could read about bunch of knights, dressed as medievalPower Rangers,wielding giant swords that were made out of pure essence, which would appear in their hands out of thin air(or morning mist)when they would call them with their minds – and not come out as a dork high on sugar.It was important to me because I was one of those dorks high on sugar.I thought – what most of you are right now quite unimaginatively repeating in unison – that this book was exclusively nothing but: amazing.Now?I’m deeply ashamed of myself for having such a high opinion of this book.So, what happened in-between my first two reads in 2011 and 2012 and this one at the end of 2017?Well, the answer is quite simple:I read better books than this one.Better books with richer worlds, more beautiful prose and far more developed characters.Better series with less inconsistencies in it, less plotholes and less… well, problems overall.Better authors that were more focused on quality of what they were writing about - where you can actually recognize their effort to make a book better;than quantity - when after first two reads and beginners infatuation by the scope and magnitude of what you were dealing with, few years later when you try to reread what you, in your ignorance, were believing was an‘instant classic’,is nothing more than a shallow, 800 pages far too long, rambling.So, the actual rating for this book is 2.25/5.How come exactly 2.25?Well, because of the chart. This one:And the long list of problems that prevented numbers on that chart from going higher.What problems?Let’s start with the biggest one for me.Characterization.The fun starts, with - what I will repeat is - probably one of the best described confusion of battle I have ever read. Anywhere.And whoever experienced a battle in real life, or at least playedCoDonline, or really, really carefully was trying to figure out what baseball is about, probably knows of confusion I’m talking about.(And if you’re wondering, yes, I experienced all three above – baseball is the worst. By far.)It’s a really great scene where you are put in this situation where you don’t have any knowledge of terrain, where you are depraved of‘bird’s perspective’in which you can'see'battle on the east flank, or what happens on the west side, so that you can act accordingly.No, here, all you can see are sweating bodies; hear yelling and cursing; and smell gore and piss.You’re a puppet, you know you’re a puppet, and like one, they move you all around.And in this chapter we are introduced to our main protagonist. OurJesus,ourSupermanof the story.With his almost omnipotent power he’s expressing, he tries to take care of those who can’t do that for themselves, and you can see in his saddened gaze – which is due to undoubtedly his equally sad and tragic past – weight of the entire world, threatening to crash him underneath.Yet he stands.Resolute.Until the next chapter where we see him in shackles, with broken spirit, strolling away as a slave toShattered Plains,where he will carry bridges into war across the chasms, towards revolution and freedom for all!(Now insert a petty sarcasm \"over 6000\" here):Nooo, I haveneverseen a character such as this!It never, ever, crossed my mind thatKaladin(our main protagonist) is a Jesus and Superman in one, withPeter Pan’s Tinkerbelle (Syl)on his shoulders as, not just as a moral compass, but a source of his powers to, let’s say, I don’t know, maybe even fly…And yes, I’m ashamed of this as well, because it took me two reads to realize similarities between Peter Pan and Tinkerbelle and Kaladin and Syl.So, now that we are on Shattered Plains… wow, wow, wow, wow… where are you going?You thought we were moving forward?No, no, no, no, this book doesn’t work like that. No…In order for us to move forward with characterization of our main protagonist, we have to go:back.Into the 800 pages long info-dumps.Oh yes.Oh no!Ramifications of this atrocity called:‘characterization through characters past’will be significant in future.First two books ofThe Stormlight Archiveseries are the most dangerous thing that happened to this genre.In 50 years, when historians will bang their heads in an effort to find roots of a downfall of epic fantasy as a genre, they’ll find its roots here. In this very book.It started already. Just this year alone I have read two books by an author who said he was inspired byBrandon Sanderson.And he did this exact same thing. He build a character by telling his past.And… do you know what some of you who read those books said about that approach of building a character?You called it an info-dump.It’s really interesting how you failed to recognize and you actually praised that same approach here, where that kind of fallacy practically came from. Oh well…Who knows how many of new, aspiring authors will be inspired by this kind of approach.All because none of us told Sanderson thatTHIS - DOESN'T - WORK.‘So what’,you’ll say.‘Surely there’s no a definitive answer what characterization is or isn’t.’Except, there is. There are books actually written about it. With carefully dissected examples of what throughout the history of literature and media all around us today, worked as a story, plot or characterization and, more importantly, what didn’t worked.And when I compared those examples of undoubted quality in long history with what Brandon tried here with, not just his characters but overall, in this book, it’s really not that much of a surprise that The Way of Kings doesn’t stand to a test of time.Not even three years passed when I noticed first problems, when I read more than 100 books of this genre and realized:‘Oh my God, there are far better books than this one.’.In essence, my problem with Kaladin’s characterization is this.You can show a character going through many changes in a story, but not all of them represent character change.True character change involves a challenging and changing of basic beliefs, leading tonewmoral action by the hero.What happens when we exclude stories about his past(those infamous info-dumps),stories that tells us how Kaladin’s character was shaped and came to be to the point where we meet him in his first chapter?Let's ask ourselves a question:Who exactly is Kaladin when we meet him for the first time?A capable young man who cares deeply about people in his unit, people he feels responsible for due to his tragic past. And he is willing to negotiate and work with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. Lighteyes.Who is Kaladin at the end of the book?A capable young man who cares deeply about people in his unit, people he feels responsible for due to his tragic past. And he is willing to negotiate and work with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. Lighteyes.Spot the differences there?No?Didn't think so.Let’s say I’m a potter. And I have a vase I want to reshape into something else. I start turning the wheel, reshaping and reshaping it – only to end up with a same vase again.Question is: why? Why spending my time, my efforts and my resources reshaping something into exactly the same thing itwasin the first place?And one can maybe argue:‘Well, it’s the journey, not the destination.’If the entirety of a journey is simply running in circles, then I’ll accept that. Because that’s exactly what happened here.Kaladin started from point 'A', went into journey of self-doubt and self-preservation, only to end up back at the same point 'A' he begin with.And that’s absolutely fine. Those are all changes.But that’s not characterization.Brandon keeps repeating this same mistake throughout this entire series.And do you know why I gave characterization of this book 2 and not 1?Apply all of which I've said about building Kalladin's character to a character ofAdolin Kholin.Who he is at the beginning and the end, moral conflicts that shaped his character inside of one cohesive story etc...Vast improvement.And do you know whose character is one constantly good thing throughout these five reads?Adolin Kholin, yes.Wonder why is that...About female characters I'll say only this: When you insist on copying female characters you created inElantrisandWarbreaker,and simply paste them from next series to next - I will call you on it.Sarene, Siri, Vivenna, ShallanandJasnahare all one and the same character.You make me miss thatMistborn'svery own Mary Sue:Vin.And just to be clear, female characters are not the only ones that get this unimaginative treatment.We have this reminiscent sidekicks:Teft.A blindly devoted, desperate in need of worshiping someoneGalladonfrom Elantris knock-off.Yes, Teft from The Way of Kings serves exactly the same purpose for main character in this book as did Galladon for main character of Elantris.Now, we only need someone who'll, like Galladon in Elantris, constantly repeat nonsense in a local dialect... something likesuleorkolo...Ah,Lopen,there you are! Yes,gancho,you, get over here,gon!I swear I see a pattern here...Worbuilding.I want to express gratitude for immense amount of effort Brandon’s team put up into creating artwork for this book. It’s really amazing, from cover itself, through maps to interior art.Just look at this map:Just look at it. Such beauty to look upon.Only to look upon, because, sadly, out of all of that, for almost two entire books we’ll spend time only on eastern barren cliffs.So, this glorious, beautiful map? You don’t need it. For two books you’ll experience three percent of it.(Red X marks the spot)Cliffs. Chasms and giant crabs.1100 pages long behemoth of a book and we’re left wondering not just how 97% of the world looks like, but also how society works on some basic levels.But I guess it was far more important to tell us that alcohol comes in variety of colors.And tease some cameo appearances in interludes that, as of yet, don’t serves to the main story.Prose.I passionately disagree with this logic how“If you’re not a writer and if you’re not eloquent enough in writing your own reviews”you shouldn’t criticize author’s prose.Do I need to be a mechanic to say that my wheel has fallen off?Do I need to be a firefighter to say that my house is burning?No?So why do I need to be a writer myself to recognize and say that author of this book is preposterously bad at writing.It’s either that, or he considers me an idiot. I do have self-respect, so I’ll go with the first one.Brandon Sanderson is lightyears behind those authors I consider decent ones.And mind you, English is not my first, nor second language, but still I’m able to recognize vastness in differences between authors prose. It’s not really science.And if we combine his fetish of constant repeating and reminding us thatJasnah(written with a J but spoken with a Y – as I said, illiteracy cuts deep in this one) is a heretic and thatSadeaslacksShardblade,at least three times per chapter with boring, witless and cringeworthily dialogues - novel is unbearably bleak and blatantly ridiculous.Just a few examples:Sadeas and his far too many times now mentioned Shardblade:\"Sadeas's hand had gone to his sword. Not a Shardblade, for Sadeas didn't have one.\"\"The highprince hated that Adolin had a blade while Sadeas had none\"\"Sadeas was calling for his grandbow.\"Remember, this is all within a single 15 pages long chapter.Second - dialogues. Those awful, awful dialogues:“I can see you are a woman of discriminating taste.”“I am. I do like my meals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.”“Pardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste in books.”“I’ve never eaten one, actually.”As well as pitiful attempts at witty banters and humor:\"Each man has his place. Mine is to make insults. Yours is to be: in-sluts.\"Barum tssss....And my favourite, Sanderson's signature over-the-top bullshit:\"Today I went fishing and I caught one. Very lucky fish other fisherman said.Cures aching joints for a good month after you eat it, and sometimes let you see when friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the sound.\"I mean, at this point, why the hell not?Allegory.Nonexistent.OK, Sanderson fans, what is this book about? What is the meaning, what is he trying to say, what’s the message?Is this book about racism? Criticizing it? I hope so. Because in this book, everyone is racist. Including Kaladin, our main protagonist.What?And how would you call a person who because of actions of two people with distinctive physical characteristics now hates everyone with those same physical characteristic?That's a definition of racist. And that's also Kaladin's POV.But, he's not the only one, no.Lighteyes people are basically Nazis. They hate anyone non-lighteye.Darkeyes people, or a common folk, of course, hate lighteyes and, because society thought them that way, they hate these slaves, these Parsh people.Parshendi, which are equivalent to Native American people... well, they hate everyone. Including themselves.And since everyone, Lighteyes, Darkeyes and Parshendi hate Parsh people, people who did no harm to anyone else, and who literally serve as slaves in this book - it only fits to make them as main villains, right?I told you this book is filled with Sanderson's over the top bullshit, didn't I?It’s a paradox how the only compliant and peaceful in collective discrimination of their race are mute, blackParshslaves which aren’t even consider as humans. But like that wasn’t enough in this, ocean of ridiculousness, by the end of this book they are proclaimed as story’s main antagonists.Empty vessels that could be filled with nothing but evil spirits.And on top of that, you'll add Shallan, our female lead, who'll say something along these lines:\"Oh, but maybe they don't actually want to be free.\"Thank you and goodnight.All in all, I understand everyone who likes this book and this series. It's just that I have read better books in my life, since my first read of this one. And the way I'm looking at reading books and what I seek in them - The Way of Kings simply doesn't provide anymore.It's a shame he got lazy in creating these worlds. But given how his readers will glorify everything he does, he would be crazy not to exploit that.Oh well..., error: We have the freedom to express our opinions in beauty of subjectivity, and we should always fight and bite to keep that.But that's not the case I'm trying to make here with this review.I’m not trying to challenge anyone’s opinion or common sense when I say that by all measures of literature in history of mankind – and what paved the way for books, movies, songs we today call classics to be considered as such because of their unique quality – The Way of Kings(as well as its far worse sequel: Words of Radiance)is one of the worst books ever written.I tried as much as I could to share my thoughts in a thoughtful and respectful manner for all of you who love this book.And I believe that I do have an actual position (as an admirer of fantasy genre) that I feel obliged to argue.Especially when I see a problem.OK?OK.Onto the actual review, then.The only book I’ve read more times than this one wasLeo Tolstoy’s War and Peace.And the reason why I read War and Peace so many times was because upon each read I discovered something new that would grip me in Leo’s story; a new character and their perspectives I overlooked or experienced in a different way every other time I took the book in my hands.A true masterpiece and a classic that rightfully stands against the time, in spite being written well over a century ago.Am I actually trying to draw a comparison between War and Peace and The Way of Kings?God, no!The only similarity these two books have, luckily, is that both are just that – books.In everything else they fail in comparison.But, I have seen many people calling The Way of Kings both a masterpiece and an instant classic of the genre.I admit, on my first two reads, I was inclined to agree.

And he is willing to negotiate and work with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. Lighteyes.Spot the differences there?No?Didn't think so.Let’s say I’m a potter. And I have a vase I want to reshape into something else. I start turning the wheel, reshaping and reshaping it – only to end up with a same vase again.Question is: why? Why spending my time, my efforts and my resources reshaping something into exactly the same thing itwasin the first place?And one can maybe argue:‘Well, it’s the journey, not the destination.’If the entirety of a journey is simply running in circles, then I’ll accept that. Because that’s exactly what happened here.Kaladin started from point 'A', went into journey of self-doubt and self-preservation, only to end up back at the same point 'A' he begin with.And that’s absolutely fine. Those are all changes.But that’s not characterization.Brandon keeps repeating this same mistake throughout this entire series.And do you know why I gave characterization of this book 2 and not 1?Apply all of which I've said about building Kalladin's character to a character ofAdolin Kholin.Who he is at the beginning and the end, moral conflicts that shaped his character inside of one cohesive story etc...Vast improvement.And do you know whose character is one constantly good thing throughout these five reads?Adolin Kholin, yes.Wonder why is that...About female characters I'll say only this: When you insist on copying female characters you created inElantrisandWarbreaker,and simply paste them from next series to next - I will call you on it.Sarene, Siri, Vivenna, ShallanandJasnahare all one and the same character.You make me miss thatMistborn'svery own Mary Sue:Vin.And just to be clear, female characters are not the only ones that get this unimaginative treatment.We have this reminiscent sidekicks:Teft.A blindly devoted, desperate in need of worshiping someoneGalladonfrom Elantris knock-off.Yes, Teft from The Way of Kings serves exactly the same purpose for main character in this book as did Galladon for main character of Elantris.Now, we only need someone who'll, like Galladon in Elantris, constantly repeat nonsense in a local dialect... something likesuleorkolo...Ah,Lopen,there you are! Yes,gancho,you, get over here,gon!I swear I see a pattern here...Worbuilding.I want to express gratitude for immense amount of effort Brandon’s team put up into creating artwork for this book. It’s really amazing, from cover itself, through maps to interior art.Just look at this map:Just look at it. Such beauty to look upon.Only to look upon, because, sadly, out of all of that, for almost two entire books we’ll spend time only on eastern barren cliffs.So, this glorious, beautiful map? You don’t need it. For two books you’ll experience three percent of it.(Red X marks the spot)Cliffs. Chasms and giant crabs.1100 pages long behemoth of a book and we’re left wondering not just how 97% of the world looks like, but also how society works on some basic levels.But I guess it was far more important to tell us that alcohol comes in variety of colors.And tease some cameo appearances in interludes that, as of yet, don’t serves to the main story.Prose.I passionately disagree with this logic how“If you’re not a writer and if you’re not eloquent enough in writing your own reviews”you shouldn’t criticize author’s prose.Do I need to be a mechanic to say that my wheel has fallen off?Do I need to be a firefighter to say that my house is burning?No?So why do I need to be a writer myself to recognize and say that author of this book is preposterously bad at writing.It’s either that, or he considers me an idiot. I do have self-respect, so I’ll go with the first one.Brandon Sanderson is lightyears behind those authors I consider decent ones.And mind you, English is not my first, nor second language, but still I’m able to recognize vastness in differences between authors prose. It’s not really science.And if we combine his fetish of constant repeating and reminding us thatJasnah(written with a J but spoken with a Y – as I said, illiteracy cuts deep in this one) is a heretic and thatSadeaslacksShardblade,at least three times per chapter with boring, witless and cringeworthily dialogues - novel is unbearably bleak and blatantly ridiculous.Just a few examples:Sadeas and his far too many times now mentioned Shardblade:\"Sadeas's hand had gone to his sword. Not a Shardblade, for Sadeas didn't have one.\"\"The highprince hated that Adolin had a blade while Sadeas had none\"\"Sadeas was calling for his grandbow.\"Remember, this is all within a single 15 pages long chapter.Second - dialogues. Those awful, awful dialogues:“I can see you are a woman of discriminating taste.”“I am. I do like my meals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.”“Pardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste in books.”“I’ve never eaten one, actually.”As well as pitiful attempts at witty banters and humor:\"Each man has his place. Mine is to make insults. Yours is to be: in-sluts.\"Barum tssss....And my favourite, Sanderson's signature over-the-top bullshit:\"Today I went fishing and I caught one. Very lucky fish other fisherman said.Cures aching joints for a good month after you eat it, and sometimes let you see when friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the sound.\"I mean, at this point, why the hell not?Allegory.Nonexistent.OK, Sanderson fans, what is this book about? What is the meaning, what is he trying to say, what’s the message?Is this book about racism? Criticizing it? I hope so. Because in this book, everyone is racist. Including Kaladin, our main protagonist.What?And how would you call a person who because of actions of two people with distinctive physical characteristics now hates everyone with those same physical characteristic?That's a definition of racist. And that's also Kaladin's POV.But, he's not the only one, no.Lighteyes people are basically Nazis. They hate anyone non-lighteye.Darkeyes people, or a common folk, of course, hate lighteyes and, because society thought them that way, they hate these slaves, these Parsh people.Parshendi, which are equivalent to Native American people... well, they hate everyone. Including themselves.And since everyone, Lighteyes, Darkeyes and Parshendi hate Parsh people, people who did no harm to anyone else, and who literally serve as slaves in this book - it only fits to make them as main villains, right?I told you this book is filled with Sanderson's over the top bullshit, didn't I?It’s a paradox how the only compliant and peaceful in collective discrimination of their race are mute, blackParshslaves which aren’t even consider as humans. But like that wasn’t enough in this, ocean of ridiculousness, by the end of this book they are proclaimed as story’s main antagonists.Empty vessels that could be filled with nothing but evil spirits.And on top of that, you'll add Shallan, our female lead, who'll say something along these lines:\"Oh, but maybe they don't actually want to be free.\"Thank you and goodnight.All in all, I understand everyone who likes this book and this series. It's just that I have read better books in my life, since my first read of this one. And the way I'm looking at reading books and what I seek in them - The Way of Kings simply doesn't provide anymore.It's a shame he got lazy in creating these worlds. But given how his readers will glorify everything he does, he would be crazy not to exploit that.Oh well... --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

Unfortunately, every one of these would have been pointed out by first or second year writing students, which simply reiterates my main point below: Shame on you Wayne Jacobsen for ruining a good book by not bothering enough to edit this properly. Simply because you wanted another \"anti-organized-church\" book on the market, and probably saw this as a vehicle (not a good one for that purpose either) is not an excuse for allowing the following:1.

I would gladly pay for Young to take a writing course in lieu of Jacobsen editing another of his books.2. Inconsistencies of plot: In one scene, the narrator - who is supposedly writing down what the main character told him - tells us what is playing on the television while the main character is passed out. How can he possibly know this? Second, why does it matter? The plot is full of these little annoying inconsistencies. The biggest and most annoying is this vague reference to a possible murder of his father. Couldn't the boy just run away from home? Did he really have to spike the dad's beer with rat poison? Did the dad die? If he does, why haven't the police come after him? If he doesn't, what is he apologizing for in the great forgiveness sequence? As I said, these inconsistencies are glaring.3.

I listened to an interview with the author. He explained that this book started out as a transcription of conversations between him and God and that the story was a convenient way of bringing those conversations to light. That makes sense.

Mr. Young, please read the Chronicles of Narnia and see how to write a half-page dialogue that says more by saying less.Unfortunately, this is only the start of what is beginning to annoy me about a book that I wanted to like. Read below for my full review.**********************************So many of my friends have recommended this book that I knew I would read it and feel strongly about it. That's an understatement. There are no Spoilers in this review.Before I began reading I wanted so much to like this book. Partly because I respected the friends who recommended it and partly because this is the author's first book. As some of you know, I personally believe that most authors have one great book in them and it is often their first (see Tracy Chevalier and J. K. Rowling). That is why I was somewhat disappointed with my reading of the first few chapters. The writer could have used a ghost writer to clean up his prose. He overwrites like a young author. Specifically, he uses too many deliberate similes and altogether too many adjectives. In fact, on the same page he uses three different similes to describe the wind. Can it really be a food group and a sigh at the same time? I digress.He also gets \"cutsie\" with his description of the main character Mack. The author needs to choose a voice to speak from. The third person omnipotent is not working for him. If you're not familiar with that POV, it is the tendency to describe what every character is thinking. Usually writers choose third person specific, meaning they know the thoughts of only one person. But later the author figures this out and sticks with the main character and lets him discover the story as it happens. So, I guess my only real criticism is that the author is not a tremendously skilled writer.Therefore, a quarter of the way through the book I was ready to be done with it. Then I was delightfully surprised by what happened next. It seems he did an about-face as soon as he came to the kernel of the story. After the tragedy that forms the spine of the tale, he tightens up the writing and I never noticed the shortcomings after that. It is like the author himself really just wanted to get to this point in the story and realized the book wouldn't make sense and would be too short without the introductory part. So be it. From this point on, I was enthralled. His meeting with God and the subsequent discoveries of God's character and the meaning of the events he has recently lived are some of the best theology ever implanted in a story. At one point near the end I actually was in tears. It may be 20 years back to the last time a book brought me to tears. I ended the book totally satisfied.If I may take one or two more liberties in criticizing a book I really enjoyed. As much as I enjoyed the folksy presentation of God in this story, there are parts that don't ring true. Holy Spirit still feels ethereal and standoffish. Wisdom's speeches are canned and the meals get repetitive. Major editing could have made this one of the great books of Christianity. Also, I doubt anyone outside Christianity will read past the first few chapters. That's a pity, but it is true. It is not written well enough and there are still too many obviously contrived parts to the plot to make it seem real to someone who is bent on criticizing Christian writers.Some of my friends who love this book will really be annoyed that I am being over-analytical. But that is what a proper book review is about. These things need to be said in order to balance the attitude which says we must lift up anything with a good message.

There are many of us working in Estremadura.”How Robert Jordan gets with the girl he meets at the start of the book after a few hours is James Bond like, as is how he as American outsider is able to takeover a Spanish guerrilla movement.

            "Translation failed for: 2/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️“What a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person.”Oh boi. This motherfucking book. Let me talk to you about this book. I HATED THE GUTS OUT OF IT. I have never given this kind of low rating to a book, I guess it's time. And I would have given it less stars but I gifted it half a start because of something I will talk about below. Here's what I wrote when I started this book two days ago:I have heard the worst fucking things about this book. This isn't the book I was going to read today but \"A Court of Wings and Ruin\" hasn't arrived yet, and I have NO other book to read (except Greek books ugh) so I'm starting this. If I don't start it now I'm afraid I will leave it get dust on my bookshelf forever so.... yah. Wish that I don't hate it as much as I'm waiting to hate it.So you can see I went into this book a (tiny) bit prejudiced. But I wasn't wrong to be and I don't think had I not being prejudiced once I started it I would have liked it. I'm entirely certain that if I hadn't read this book now, it would have collected dust in my bookshelves for the rest of my days. And I'm glad I got rid of this now because when I look at books in my bookshelves I haven't read it gives me anxiety. Anyway, now let's start with the tea.Quentin Jacobsen has spent a lifetime loving the magnificently adventurous Margo Roth Spiegelman from afar. So when she cracks open a window and climbs back into his life—dressed like a ninja and summoning him for an ingenious campaign of revenge— he follows. After their all-nighter ends, and a new day breaks, Q arrives at school to discover that Margo, always an enigma, has now become a mystery. But Q soon learns that there are clues— and they’re for him. Urged down a disconnected path, the closer he gets, the less Q sees the girl he thought he knew.My past with John Green is not as big as other people's. I had readThe Fault in Our Starsa gazillion years ago so I don't remember jack shit andTurtles All the Way Downa few months ago which I truly enjoyed. John Green has the reputation of writing pretentious books so yeah, he didn't disappoint with this one. This is an old book and it showed. Mostly on the part that it entailed little to no diversity. Also some good old misogyny. But it is to be expected with a book published in fucking 2008.Let's start with what I liked about this book, won't take much time- ???? ??- The road trip. I gave this book half a star more because of it. It was fun and entertaining but also unrealistic but this is John Green for ya.- ?????????- ???????!!!!- Lacey and Radar. They were cool.- ???- The quotes??? Some inspirational shit.- ??? ?????- Yeah.- This line“Margo was not a miracle. She was not an adventure. She was not a fine and precious thing. She was a girl.”It was the only part in the book that showed Margo to be just a regular girl, not some mythical creature out of this world. I'm very glad it was also included in the movie but let's talk about all these things more later on.And the tea starts- Let's start from the first 30 pages. What the fuck was that about? A little 9-8-year-old-whatever-tf girl is doing an investigation on a crime and she goes to the crime scene and the detective or whatever asks the fucking 9-8-year-old-whatever-tf girl if she's with the school newspaper and if she's not, he will answer her questions and then the 9-8-year-old-whatever-tf girl goes to the house next door and a GROWN UP woman tells the 9-8-year-old-whatever-tf girl that the man killed himself because of his divorce and because he was troubled. ????? Who tells a 9-8-year-old-whatever-tf girl these things? Which adult in their right mind does that?? I don't know why I'm stuck at this for so long, but those details weren't included in the movie and I'm very glad of it.-Margo. Oh man. From now on when people ask mewhich is the most annoying character for you, I will say her name. Margo Roth Spiegelman. Margo Roth Spiegelman. Fucking MARGO ROTH SPIEGELMAN. I didn't even need to look up her name to write it right. It's stuck in my head for the rest of my life. The perfect girl. The myth. The legend. Margo Roth Spiegelman. The Mary Sue to end all Mary Sues. The most entitled bitch to have ever walked the Earth. Margo Roth Spiegelman. I didn't care if she would be found. I knew she would be doing something stupid and \"inspirational\" or whatever. She didn't deserve the attention she got.-The characters. I didn't like any of them. Not even Q. Basically from the beginning till the end I didn't care about any of the characters' fates. I just wanted the book to end because I was extremely bored and unsatisfied.-The plot. What was even the plot?-The romance.NO.-The pace. The pace was just... slow after a certain point. So many clues and then some high school stuff and some more clues and some shit Ben kept saying and more clues and then the road trip and then it's over.- I was rolling my eyes so hard when Q left his fuckingGRADUATIONin the middle to go find the entitled bitch when she didn't even want to be found. And I hated that his friends followed him. This is where this road trip was unrealistic for me. This would never happen in real life. And that's why they changed it in the movie too.- I loathed the fact that Margo, after not talking to Q for 10 years or something, she was so confident in going into his room in the middle of the night and asking him for his car and 11 favors. Like... come on. The dude was head over heels in love, otherwise no one would have done that. It's once again... unrealistic.- I just didn't wait for this book to be over. It was slowly killing me from the inside. I would rather have eaten dog shit than read this book. It was this bad for me.And now let's discuss the movie adaptationListen to my incredible story for a bit. When I read books which have been adapted into movies or tv shows I ALWAYS WATCH THEM. NO MATTER IF I WANT TO RIP THE BOOK IN TWO I ALWAYS WATCH THE MOVIE OR THE TV SHOW THAT IS INSPIRED BY IT. ALWAYS. So, after hearing this, you will realize I didn't watch the movie because I liked the book, but because I always do. And it's also an excuse for me lately to watch movies, because if I don't watch a movie in the cinema, I never do at home. I'm more of a books and tv shows kind of gal, what can you do?So, let's start! The movie made the story and the characters a little bit more interesting. It cut out the boring parts and added some very funny and nice scenes that lacked in the book. I liked that they didn't lose their graduation for the road trip to find Margo, because it was totally bollocks. I liked the changes they made with that aspect of the book. I liked the casting, I think it was spot on. Except Margo and not because Cara isn't good enough for the part but because of her weight. Margo is supposed to be \"curvy\" and she got \"bullied\" by Lacey because of her figure. And I hated that they didn't keep this part in the movie because there wasn't any real reason after all for Margo to be hating Lacey. And just... don't erase curvy people. Margo was supposed to be \"the most perfect and popular girl in the entire school\" and she was curvy. Just let that part in, damn it. Also, this movie's description must have been:THE FRIENDZONE OF THE FRIENDZONES.Honestly, why make Q's love for Margo unrequited? When it was the opposite in the book? I didn't understand this change. It was unnecessary and it didn't add anything to the plot. But, to sum it up, the movie was a good enough adaptation for this book. But I didn't like it. Because I didn't like the book. Duh.In conclusion, this book was a nightmare for me, from start to finish. I didn't earn anything from this book, not lessons, not a new ship, not new favorite characters, nothing. I just wanted it to end. I know it's a popular book and I'm very sorry for this negative review, but not all books are for everyone. And till the next one... K BYE!, error: 2/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️“What a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person.”Oh boi. This motherfucking book. Let me talk to you about this book. I HATED THE GUTS OUT OF IT. I have never given this kind of low rating to a book, I guess it's time. And I would have given it less stars but I gifted it half a start because of something I will talk about below. Here's what I wrote when I started this book two days ago:I have heard the worst fucking things about this book. This isn't the book I was going to read today but \"A Court of Wings and Ruin\" hasn't arrived yet, and I have NO other book to read (except Greek books ugh) so I'm starting this. If I don't start it now I'm afraid I will leave it get dust on my bookshelf forever so.... yah. Wish that I don't hate it as much as I'm waiting to hate it.So you can see I went into this book a (tiny) bit prejudiced. But I wasn't wrong to be and I don't think had I not being prejudiced once I started it I would have liked it. I'm entirely certain that if I hadn't read this book now, it would have collected dust in my bookshelves for the rest of my days. And I'm glad I got rid of this now because when I look at books in my bookshelves I haven't read it gives me anxiety. Anyway, now let's start with the tea.Quentin Jacobsen has spent a lifetime loving the magnificently adventurous Margo Roth Spiegelman from afar. So when she cracks open a window and climbs back into his life—dressed like a ninja and summoning him for an ingenious campaign of revenge— he follows. After their all-nighter ends, and a new day breaks, Q arrives at school to discover that Margo, always an enigma, has now become a mystery. But Q soon learns that there are clues— and they’re for him. Urged down a disconnected path, the closer he gets, the less Q sees the girl he thought he knew.My past with John Green is not as big as other people's. I had readThe Fault in Our Starsa gazillion years ago so I don't remember jack shit andTurtles All the Way Downa few months ago which I truly enjoyed. John Green has the reputation of writing pretentious books so yeah, he didn't disappoint with this one. This is an old book and it showed. Mostly on the part that it entailed little to no diversity. Also some good old misogyny. But it is to be expected with a book published in fucking 2008.Let's start with what I liked about this book, won't take much time- ???? ??- The road trip. I gave this book half a star more because of it. It was fun and entertaining but also unrealistic but this is John Green for ya.- ?????????- ???????!!!!- Lacey and Radar. They were cool.- ???- The quotes??? Some inspirational shit.- ??? ?????- Yeah.- This line“Margo was not a miracle. She was not an adventure. She was not a fine and precious thing.

            "Translation failed for: This book was astonishing to me - particularly the narrative of Kunta Kinte's life. This is why I read! What an amazing description of African culture and the rights of manhood. Then, the horrible violation of slavery and the cross-cultural experience of an African joining slaves who were predominately born in the United States. Sounds silly, but though I've read many books on slavery, none have dealt with the differences among slaves themselves and how growing up as a slave shaped how African Americans thought and interacted both with whites and with newly arrived Africans. I could understand why Alex Haley is the best-selling African-American author to date.I wanted to give this book a 5. But, two things prevented me from giving it the highest rating.First, when the book moves away from Kunte Kinte into successive generations, while it has engaging moments, something of the brilliance was lost. This was strange to me. After reading the book, I did some research on Alex Haley and Roots, and discovered that there were allegations that Haley plagiarized from Harold Courlander's \"The African\", published nine years before Roots (It seems the passages in question were concentrated in the life of Kunta Kinte); after Courlander sued Haley an out of court monetary settlement from Haley to Courlander was made, though Haley seems to have maintained innocence in the matter. Could it be that the brilliance of the book came from Courlander's work? I don't know and have requested \"The African\" from inter-library loan in order to investigate further. Margaret Walker Alexander filed a similar suit, but hers was dismissed. The legal actions of both Courlander and Walker were resolved in 1978. This was two years after the publication of Roots in 1976, and one year after a national television miniseries boosted sales and interest in 1977. I will also hunt down Walker's book.Secondly, the genealogical work behind the book has come into question. This wouldn't be a problem, except that the final chapters present the genealogy as factually verified by the author in an attempt to place the work firmly in the historical fiction genre. In addition, these final chapters uphold Haley's lineage as a kind of beacon for all of African descent who \"don't know who they are.\" This could have been done in the realm of fiction, without the assertion of fact, but it wasn't.I was very disappointed by these revelations. I felt mislead, even betrayed, by Alex Haley. However, I must concede that even with these faults, the book is a wonderful read that opened up new doors of thought to me and shaped my thinking in new ways. For that, I am grateful.--As a follow up, I have also confirmed that Haley plagiarized from Margaret Walker's book, Jubilee, an absolutely fabulous book written by the first African American woman to earn a PhD. I would highly recommend this book. In addition, reading both \"The African\" and \"Jubilee\" helped me to see a little more of what Haley was getting at with writing Roots.Now that I understand his perspective better, I can see that Roots definitely had an agenda. Black Power connected with \"Africanism\" and Islam, which is probably also represented in \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\". Note the following when you read it:1) The extremely compelling portions on Africa have been criticized as current social anthropology as opposed to history.2) There is an emphasis (lacking in Courlander's \"The African\") on Islamic belief, as opposed to voodoo/ various animistic beliefs being the religious and cultural grounding of the African community. The conquest of Northern Africa by Arab Muslims is completely ignored by Haley as if Islam was indigenous to Africa which it was not. There is also complete disregard for the prevalence of Christianity in Africa from shortly after the life of Jesus Christ (including, for example the Church Father, Saint Augustine (of Berber origin). The spread of Christianity was through conversion, not conquest, and it far pre-dated the transatlantic slave trade.3) Christianity is covertly proclaimed as the \"white man religion,\" used by slave traders to stomp out cultural identity and practices that might lead blacks to gather up enough confidence to start a successful rebellion. While this idea may have had some acceptance by the uneducated of the time, it is non-sensical given the historical record.4) Apparently, the book kicked off a ton of travel to Africa, during which African Americans found they were not embraced as Haley alludes they would be. Also, many believe Haley's documentation of his trip to Africa is entirely false and that the groit he met and all the officials involved were coached and eager to see Haley be successful in generating interest in their country.5) All of these things would be forgivable IF Haley had merely written a work of fiction. We would suspect authors had their own ideas, agendas and perspectives. But, the intro and those last chapters are horrifically misleading. It's almost like he believed his own press! And the IDEA that he was going for is powerful, that Africans were stripped of their roots by the slave industry and that this has been harmful to them. But how this played out in the events around the book reveals the strong motives he had for both personal gain and promoting these false perspectives (and African Islam/ Black Power as the logical fulfillment/ salvation to such a paradigm) to facilitate growth of these movements.6) Some of the quotes, references to Haley lead me to believe he wasn't a very nice person... not that anyone wants to say that outright, but it's there. It certainly appears he was looking to a black Muslim identity for wholeness, salvation, and power. Hopefully, he found peace with God and others before he died.Also, regarding Jubilee specifically, I recognized one paragraph in the first chapter that I'm pretty sure was copied verbatim. The main character, Vyry (and her mother, Sis Hetta whose death opens the book) seem to have 'inspired' Haley's character Kizzy. But, as obvious as that was, perhaps the biggest thing Haley lifted from Jubilee was the idea to write about one's descendants and that such knowledge was important for the coming generations. Walker's dedication communicates this intention with less dramatic flair than Haley's claims about flying the globe, roaming through records, and finding groits who harbor verbal testimony of his ancestors, all while the oldest and last of his relatives is dying.I would still recommend Roots, but I thought these observations might be helpful in positioning the work within its proper historical context.

            "Translation failed for: This is a book that it seems like I should like. It deals with issues of religion, including a strong critique of religion as we know it, presents socially progressive ideas about sex and relationships, and relies upon a fundamentally humanist, individualist philosophy.In the end, however, I can't get past a few things to really like this book.1. The word \"grok.\" I understand the meaning and significance of the word within the book and I understand why Heinlein chose to create a new word to carry this meaning, but \"grok\"? It's an ugly word and it gets used about 150 times too many in the book.2. The use of mystic religious concepts and practices. Heinlein critiques traditional, human religions, but he is unable or unwilling, finally, to leave behind the trappings of religion, relying upon them to bolster his argument. This bothers me because it feels like manipulation, like a man trying to have it both ways by using the religiosity and losing the religion. Michael admits that his philosophy, his truth, \"couldn't be taught in schools\" and says, \"I was forced to smuggle it in as a religion--which it is not--and con the marks into tasting it by appealing to their curiosity\" (419). He admits that he is manipulating his audience (just as Heinlein manipulates his) as well as admitting that the people he is trying to save are no more than marks, dupes to be conned. This is entirely too cynical for my taste and does not accord with the whole \"Thou art God and I am God and all that groks is God\" philosophy.3. The sexism of the text, which is inseparable from its heteronormativity and even homophobia. Despite Heinlein's progressive (especially for the time) ideas about sexuality and desire, he reinforces the gender dichotomy repeatedly, putting women and homosexuals in their place as he does so. Sometimes this is obviously negative and hard to miss, especially for a modern reader: \"Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault\" (304). At other times this is done with apparently positive statements: \"Male-femaleness is the greatest gift we have--romantic physical love may be unique to this planet\" (419). A statement like this one is troubling not because of its emphasis on romantic physical love but because of its insistence on the male-female gender dichotomy as a necessary component of that love.A more substantial example arises when Jill discovers that she likes to be looked at it, that it makes her feel desirable. She says, \"Okay, if a healthy woman liked to be looked at, then it follows as the night the day that healthy men should like to look, else there was just no darn sense to it! At which point, she finally understood, intellectually, Duke and his pictures\" (302-3). The realization that she likes to be looked at is fine as far as it goes, although the immediate leap from there to pornography is definitely a problem (pornography of course having huge and unavoidable issues of power wrapped up in it that this analysis neatly sidesteps). Following Jill's realization of her own desire to be looked at, Mike comes to see that \"Naughty pictures are a great goodness\" and they go together to strip clubs to enjoy the live version. However, \"Jill found that she 'grokked naughty pictures' only through a man's eyes. If Mike watched, she shared his mood, from sensuous pleasure to full rut--but if Mike's attention wandered, the model, dancer, or peeler was just another woman. She decided that this was fortunate; to have discovered in herself Lesbian tendencies would have been too much\" (307). Here, Heinlein brings together his progressive, free love ideas about sex itself with his more traditional ideas about gender roles and his leaning toward homophobia. The conclusion Jill arrives at here is that a) sex and desire are good, b) women are the spectacle, never the spectator, and c) lesbianism is completely taboo, even for someone who is otherwise interested in opening herself up to sexual love in its many forms. This one scene simply brings together these ideas that recur throughout the second half of the book. Repeatedly, it is made clear that homosexual behavior is a danger for Mike to avoid and that women's role in sexual behavior is essentially passive.4. The emphasis onself, whether in self-love, self-pleasure, self-control. There are two basic ideas here. One is stated by Patricia Paiwonski, Mike's first convert, who says, \"God wants us to be Happy and He told us how: 'Love one another!' Love a snake if the poor thing needs love. Love thy neighbor . . . . And by 'love' He didn't mean namby-pamby old-maid love that's scared to look up from a hymn book for fear of seeing a temptation of the flesh. If God hated flesh,why did He make so much of it?. . . Love little babies that always need changing and love strong, smelly men so that there will be more babies to love--and in between go on loving because it's sogoodto love!\" (288). Love is wonderful, love is a good goal, but this is a love I am suspicious of, for it is a love based on feeling good, based on happiness. There's nothing wrong with feeling good and being happy, of course, but if feeling good and being happy are the primary goals of life, then that opens the door for abuses of others in the name of love or happiness and seems a rather meaningless goal in and of itself. Hedonism alone is not enough for me.The second basic idea is Mike's final message to the people: \"The Truth is simple but the Way of Man is hard. First you must learn to control yourself. The rest follows. Blessed is he who knows himself and commands himself, for the world is his and love and happiness and peace walk with him wherever he goes\" (429). Again, this is not a bad goal--for once, finally, Mike brings a message of personal responsibility to add to the free love and grokking that has constituted most of the rest of the book. However, to expect the rest to follow from that kind of responsibility and self-control is just silly. This isThe Secret, this is \"name-it-and-claim-it\" theology, this is bullshit. Like the idea that God wants us to be happy so if we all try to live for our own happiness, it will all work out, this is a philosophy that believes that YOU are the center of the universe, that everything will work out for the best.This is the complete opposite of the philosophy provided in Kurt Vonnegut'sSirens of Titan. Vonnegut also emphasizes love and finding a kind of happiness, but in his universe, those things are refuges in the midst of chaos, small things we can each do to make the world we live in a little better, a little more livable, not means to become masters of the universe. For Heinlein, God moves from out there to in here, validating each individual person's individual desire and decision; for Vonnegut, there is no God, not out there and not in here. For me, that is much more appealing., error: This is a book that it seems like I should like. It deals with issues of religion, including a strong critique of religion as we know it, presents socially progressive ideas about sex and relationships, and relies upon a fundamentally humanist, individualist philosophy.In the end, however, I can't get past a few things to really like this book.1. The word \"grok.\" I understand the meaning and significance of the word within the book and I understand why Heinlein chose to create a new word to carry this meaning, but \"grok\"? It's an ugly word and it gets used about 150 times too many in the book.2. The use of mystic religious concepts and practices. Heinlein critiques traditional, human religions, but he is unable or unwilling, finally, to leave behind the trappings of religion, relying upon them to bolster his argument. This bothers me because it feels like manipulation, like a man trying to have it both ways by using the religiosity and losing the religion. Michael admits that his philosophy, his truth, \"couldn't be taught in schools\" and says, \"I was forced to smuggle it in as a religion--which it is not--and con the marks into tasting it by appealing to their curiosity\" (419). He admits that he is manipulating his audience (just as Heinlein manipulates his) as well as admitting that the people he is trying to save are no more than marks, dupes to be conned. This is entirely too cynical for my taste and does not accord with the whole \"Thou art God and I am God and all that groks is God\" philosophy.3. The sexism of the text, which is inseparable from its heteronormativity and even homophobia. Despite Heinlein's progressive (especially for the time) ideas about sexuality and desire, he reinforces the gender dichotomy repeatedly, putting women and homosexuals in their place as he does so. Sometimes this is obviously negative and hard to miss, especially for a modern reader: \"Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault\" (304). At other times this is done with apparently positive statements: \"Male-femaleness is the greatest gift we have--romantic physical love may be unique to this planet\" (419). A statement like this one is troubling not because of its emphasis on romantic physical love but because of its insistence on the male-female gender dichotomy as a necessary component of that love.A more substantial example arises when Jill discovers that she likes to be looked at it, that it makes her feel desirable. She says, \"Okay, if a healthy woman liked to be looked at, then it follows as the night the day that healthy men should like to look, else there was just no darn sense to it! At which point, she finally understood, intellectually, Duke and his pictures\" (302-3). The realization that she likes to be looked at is fine as far as it goes, although the immediate leap from there to pornography is definitely a problem (pornography of course having huge and unavoidable issues of power wrapped up in it that this analysis neatly sidesteps). Following Jill's realization of her own desire to be looked at, Mike comes to see that \"Naughty pictures are a great goodness\" and they go together to strip clubs to enjoy the live version. However, \"Jill found that she 'grokked naughty pictures' only through a man's eyes. If Mike watched, she shared his mood, from sensuous pleasure to full rut--but if Mike's attention wandered, the model, dancer, or peeler was just another woman. She decided that this was fortunate; to have discovered in herself Lesbian tendencies would have been too much\" (307). Here, Heinlein brings together his progressive, free love ideas about sex itself with his more traditional ideas about gender roles and his leaning toward homophobia. The conclusion Jill arrives at here is that a) sex and desire are good, b) women are the spectacle, never the spectator, and c) lesbianism is completely taboo, even for someone who is otherwise interested in opening herself up to sexual love in its many forms. This one scene simply brings together these ideas that recur throughout the second half of the book. Repeatedly, it is made clear that homosexual behavior is a danger for Mike to avoid and that women's role in sexual behavior is essentially passive.4. The emphasis onself, whether in self-love, self-pleasure, self-control. There are two basic ideas here. One is stated by Patricia Paiwonski, Mike's first convert, who says, \"God wants us to be Happy and He told us how: 'Love one another!' Love a snake if the poor thing needs love. Love thy neighbor . . . . And by 'love' He didn't mean namby-pamby old-maid love that's scared to look up from a hymn book for fear of seeing a temptation of the flesh. If God hated flesh,why did He make so much of it?. . . Love little babies that always need changing and love strong, smelly men so that there will be more babies to love--and in between go on loving because it's sogoodto love!\" (288). Love is wonderful, love is a good goal, but this is a love I am suspicious of, for it is a love based on feeling good, based on happiness. There's nothing wrong with feeling good and being happy, of course, but if feeling good and being happy are the primary goals of life, then that opens the door for abuses of others in the name of love or happiness and seems a rather meaningless goal in and of itself. Hedonism alone is not enough for me.The second basic idea is Mike's final message to the people: \"The Truth is simple but the Way of Man is hard. First you must learn to control yourself. The rest follows. Blessed is he who knows himself and commands himself, for the world is his and love and happiness and peace walk with him wherever he goes\" (429).

I don’t stand behind my novel, but I do stand behind my idea.”Authors sometimes give themselves a giant pat on the back, but couch it in self-deprecating language.

And how the characters themselves represented the unique attributes--in splinter form--of the Russian whole.Well that’s all great. You read it and take from it what you want. I found it tangled, hard to follow, uninteresting. The characters were so weighed down by being representatives of the Russian whole that they failed to be engaging characters by themselves.

Certainly nothing likeTHISpowerful, euphonic sentence.(Important) Because I know Fyodor can bring the noise, it leads me to believe that the translation is faulty, dated.

Let me, for example, open the book to page 580--a random choice--and list every instance on both pages where the character staging is electrified....got up rather late andimmediatelyrecalled......first moment sheburstinto tears......the princeat oncereassured her......he wassuddenly struckby thestrongcompassion......Vera blusheddeeply......she criedin alarm, quicklydrawing her hand away......went away in astrangelytroubled state......her father hadhurriedoff......Koylaranin, also for only a minute......in agreathurry......was in a state ofintense and troubledagitation......wasdeeply and violentlymoved......poor boy wasthunderstruck......quietlyburstinto tears......hejumpedup......hurriedlyinquired about......addedin haste......was predictingdisaster......was askingpointedquestions......with a gesture ofvexation......accursed morbidmistrustfulness......in the form of an order,abruptly, dryly, without explanation......suddenlyturning around......andfeverishlylooked at his watch...Remember, this came from a total of 1200 printed words. The entire book is similarly charged. I got tired of reading all this ‘juiced’ action. Did Dostoevsky intend 660 pages of melododrama, or was this a translator’s interpretation? I got robbed, man. Bad translation. The review stops here. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: This book is a wonderful cautionary tale. I will probably read it again with my daughter when she is old enough to discuss it. Unfortunately, I'm afraid the reason most people will read the book and see the new upcoming movie, is for a different reason. Chris McCandless (in the book, and from what I understand in the movie), is a hero and courageous for flying in the face of everything he grew up with to find a better way. A young man unhappy with the materialism, hunger, and waste in the world; angry with his father for not being a perfect father to him; intellectually superior, a fantastic athlete in top condition... and yet a young man who died because of his own decisions and his own actions. He cut off ties to his family, hitchhiked and worked his way to Alaska, headed \"into the wild\" in April 1992, and was found dead in August 1992 most probably from starvation. How wonderful to \"fight against the odds\" and \"ask real questions\". Unfortunately, Chris didn't really fight against any odds, he took the easy way out by cutting off real relationships. Chris may have asked real questions, but he denied real people the opportunity to answer them in any way, because he had already decided what was \"the right way\". This is not heroic. It is immaturity. It is tragic and sad, yes, but not heroic or courageous.After reading the book, I think Chris died because he was foolish. Intellectually bright, yes. Athletically gifted, yes. But he had no wisdom. Wisdom has been defined as \"skill in living\", and wisdom is not always bestowed on the young and the healthy and the intellectually smart. The opposite of wisdom is foolishness. His anger and questioning drove him not to wisdom, but to self-reliance and an overweening arrogance in his own ability to \"get through it\". Well, we see the result of those decisions and those attitudes.... to quote Darwin, Chris is an example of how \"survival of the fittest\" applies. Chris was not \"fit\", therefore he did not \"survive\". But why wasn't he fit? He was smart and young and gifted in many ways, but he chose to abandon relationships and abandon those who loved him and create himself anew with no relationships and no ties. He walked away from people who loved him, made friends with people who came to love him, and walked away from all of that to find his answers \"in the wild\" on his own. The way away from love and relationship leads not to life, but indeed to death. And death is what Chris got.The book quotes Chris' mother as saying, \"I haven't prayed since we lost him.\" (pg. 202) An older man who befriended Chris, Ronald Franz, also says, \"When Alex left for Alaska, I prayed. I asked God to keep his finger on the shoulder of that one; I told him that boy was special. But he let Alex die. So on December 26, when I learned what had happened, I renounced the Lord. I withdrew my church membership and became an atheist. I decided I couldn't believe in a God who would let something that terrible happen to a boy like Alex.\" (pg. 60) But God didn't do anything to Chris, except let him do as he wanted? If Chris sought real answers to his hard questions, God is there, and God can help, but you have to know you need help and submit to someone wiser than you. Chris McCandless never submitted willingly to anyone, and he certainly never admitted anyone else had teaching or wisdom for him. He was smarter than everyone else, better able to see the truth than anyone else. So the heritage Chris McCandless left is one that drives his mother to stop praying, and converts an old man to atheism. Is this the heritage anyone would want?So read this book, but read it with questions in mind. Why are we lauding a young man as a hero who was actually a foolish man? What kind of society are we in where real courage and real heroism are somehow playing 2nd fiddle to selfishness and arrogance? When are you so intellectually intelligent that you become stupid? Is there any time when foolish decisions could be called \"courageous\"? In a search for truth and what really matters in life, is it acceptable to think nothing of hurting those people who are most vulnerable to you? When you die, will the way you lived your life cause others to abandon their faith or grow in their faith? Is it ever courageous to be selfish and think only of yourself? Is it harder to walk away from a relationship, or to stay in a relationship and work on making it better? Would you ever teach anyone else that the way to have real relationships is to limit yourself only to those people who cannot ever hurt you?Real courage, real heroism comes when you love others and you serve others. Real courage has nothing selfish in it. Fathers and husbands who remain with their families and provide for them, even though they would rather have a mid-life crisis and leave it all, they are courageous and heroic. They remain, they work, they don't father or husband perfectly, but they remain in difficult relationships. It courageous to stay in the hard parts of life, and try. Mothers and wives who sacrifice and serve again and again and again without books being written about them, without thanks, but who continue to love and give of themselves to others. That is courageous. It is hard to stay in messy relationships. It is easy to leave. It is courageous to stay and do hard things. It is easy to leave and do what you want.So, let's read this book, but read it as a cautionary tale. This is what happens when you seemingly 'have it all', but have not love. When you die, will people be driven to become atheists? Will people stop praying when you are dead? Or will you live a life of wisdom and love? Will you leave behind you a heritage of godly love and service? Will people pray more because of the example you left them? Will they be more loving, better mothers or fathers or sisters or brothers? Or will they become angry and arrogant and foolishness? Yes, this is a good book to read. But let's read it for the right reasons and with the right questions.[NOTE: In the book, and in the movie, the author proposes that Chris ate some poison berries which caused his death. But tests have been made around the area, and plants that would have been available to Chris were tested, and no toxic berries or plants have been found. The truth is probably that he starved. Too few calories coming in, high expenditure of calories for hunting and keeping warm resulted eventually in such a calorie deficit that he died.]Some good articles I found on Chris McCandless include:http://www.newsminer.com/news/2008/ap...http://nmge.gmu.edu/textandcommunity/...Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote: “I am exposed continually to what I will call the ‘McCandless Phenomenon.’ People, nearly always young men, come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent […:] When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn’t even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he [had:] had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament […:] Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide.”[18:] Some may argue that this is what he wanted all along, given his troubled past****************An update as of Sept 2013 as to how McCandless died. Seehttp://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs...which documents the poison contained in wild potato seeds. Consuming these seeds introduces a neurotoxin into the body which results in lathyrism. This condition causes gradual paralysis which ultimately made McCandless very weak, unable to stand or walk, and thus unable to forage or hunt for food., error: This book is a wonderful cautionary tale.

Oliver's debut, Before I Fall.  So understandably, I was very excited to hear about her next book, Delirium.  A dystopian world where love is a disease, written by the clearly very talented Oliver?  Yeah, I can get behind that.  I settled in to wait the long, cruel months until the February release date, when I got a surprise package in the mail from thePolish Outlander-- her ARC of Delirium!  Imagine my delight.  I held off reading it for a few days, just to give myself some distance from Matched, which has a very similar concept, and which I'd just finished.  But I didn't want to wait too long, so, similarities be damned, I went ahead and read it.I'm going to try to not keep comparing this to Matched, which isn't fair -- Matched had its own review, after all -- but I do have to say that, though each is its own thing, the similarities are pretty strong, and my reaction to each was the same -- I wanted so much more than I got.Lest you think this review is wholly negative, let me start with the things I did like.  I love the concept, and think it has the potential to be really powerful and fascinating.  There is a flow to it most of the time that kept me reading even when I was frustrated by other things.  And there are these moments that shine through, these beautiful little word gems that Oliver creates, that reminds me of why I loved Before I Fall, and why I was so excited to read this.But.But I was so very, very excited for this that I think I was even more let down by it than Matched, which was also something I was eager for.  Before I Fall was fresh and compelling, and I felt like so much of Oliver, so much heart and so much work, went into it.  I didn't feel the same about Delirium.  I'm not going to accuse Oliver of selling out or hopping on a trend, but I do wonder how much passion was behind this story.  It seemed sort of sloppy (and yes, I know, I read an ARC, and that may account for some of it).  But there were so many inconsistencies and questions I had that I couldn't ever commit.  I could only go along so far until logic would intrude.  I would be forced to ask myself things like, If Lena was just bitten (badly) in the leg by a dog, why does Alex kissing her seem to erase not only any pain, but even any mention of the bite, until it's like an afterthought?  How does her family not notice that either a) she's wearing pants in the middle of sweltering August, and limping, or b) she's not wearing pants and the scar is showing and she's limping?  Because it has to be one of those 2 things.  And though the \"cure\" may not make them care for her safety so much, it doesn't take away their suspicious natures.  [Also, setting aside the fact that she walked home, how did theyjust walk home?  Just like that.  With raiding parties everywhere, and her bitten terribly, they just strolled on home, illegally, down the street?  How do they get away with all the shit they get away with, in this repressive society?  Hmm...] Things like this were peppered throughout the story, and they just made it nearly impossible to buy in to what was going on.Smaller things, too, like words and phrases and things we have now that I don't see any use for, or don't believably buy would be in the world Oliver created.  And, of course, the much bigger things, like how did all this -- the discovery of the \"deliria\", the cure, the restrictions, the beliefs, all of it -- come to be?  I know it may not be what Lauren intended, but with such a seemingly science-influenced dystopia, I need some good scientific reasoning, some \"evidence\" -- real or gov't created -- that backs everything up, some explanation or plausible scenario that lets this total overhaul of human beliefs and passions come to bein a matter of 60 yearsor so.  That's a very, VERY brief period of time for such a huge and total change to take place, so I need reality to intrude a little.  I need either some hints of a really big conspiracy, or something so huge and devastating that people as a whole almost go into a state of shock or numbness that allows this to happen.  Because, as a general rule, people don't willingly submit to mass lobotomies or the eradication of their feelings for the people they love -- or hate -- without some serioussomethingacting as a catalyst.  Petty strife and crimes of passion may make youthinkof Eternal Sunshining your mind spotless, but in an abstract, angry, wouldn't-it-be-lovely kind of way, and not a bring-on-the-procedure kind of way.  Some science, some history, some dogma, somethingbeyond the sometimes eerie, sometimes meh snippets of \"texts\" that start every chapter, would have gone a long way toward helping me willingly suspend my disbelief.But even if I could have set the worldbuilding and believability aside -- no easy task in a concept novel like this -- for it to be saved, the characters and plot would have had to really shine.But I felt like everything was a little wooden, a little cardboard, a little less than believable and real.  The love interest, Alex, was okay enough, but why should Lena care about him, and why should I?  I understand why he cares about Lena, but that's not something we really find out until Lena is already head over heels infected/in love, and I don't understand how she got there.  As a reader, in order to take that leap with a character, we need to know why, we need to feel it.  All I got was that he was a boy who payed attention to her, he winked, he smiled, he seemed a bit smarmy and she's hooked.  Now, yes, I get that's enough for a teenage infatuation, and it may be heightened by the taboo nature of it.  I even get that his more easy manner reminded Lena of her mother, who was incurable.But for Lena, who has always been terrified of the deliria, which tore her world apart, and who has always looked forward to her procedure, and been so afraid of stepping out of the box, who is afraid to say, to evenhear, the word love -- for her to completely flip and become reckless and passionate and all the other stuff that comes with being the things she's always feared...hmm.  The only way this really works for me, the only thing that would make me buy it and appreciate it, was if it took the slant that the deliria was real and she'd become infected.  Otherwise, I have no choice but to think this is a cheesy, run of the mill YA romance where one look from a guy makes a girl throw her entire being out the window and become a swooning, fluttery mess with no relation to the person she once was, and who would die for the roguish boy she knows nothing about.  Which is, apparently, what every teenage girl is secretly waiting to do.Maybe the deliriaisreal.Reviewed December 19th, 2010, error: 2.5 -

            "Translation failed for: I can't really be bothered to write my usual style of review. I'm the last person on the planet to read it, so summarizing the plot just seems a waste of time. Instead, I'm going to skip straight to my criticism.First off, if you don't like first person narration, this is not the book that will change your mind. It uses the device particularly poorly. Our narrator, the heroine, at times has too much insight into the minds of others and at other times has too little knowledge of her own mind. None of her personality comes through in the narration. She just describes what she and the people around her did, using a flat, emotionless sort of voice. It was like the story was written in third person then run through a find/replace to switch the pronouns. Abby thinks bizarre things like:I looked down to my plate, letting the long strands of my caramel hair create a curtain between us.and mangles grammar like:Kara was reading ahead in her brand-new books, grimacing at America and I when we walked in.Secondly, I think this early bit of characterization says it all about Travis:He had tattoos on opposite sides of his chest, and black tribal art covering each of his bulging shoulders.Since tribal tattoo = douchebag, the fact that he's a misogynist asshole didn't surprise me too much:“I don’t promise anyone anything, Pidge. She didn’t stipulate a relationship before she spread eagle on my couch.”I stared at the couch with revulsion. “She’s someone’s daughter, Travis. What if, down the line, someone treats your daughter like that?”“My daughter better not drop her panties for some jackass she just met, let’s put it that way.”Nice sex negative message there, don't you think? Abby the virgin is a good girl. All of Travis' past one night stands are referred to as \"sluts,\" \"bimbos,\" \"whores\" and \"Barbie dolls.\" Abby joins right in with Travis on the slut shaming, making it plain that the sexual double standard isn't just a character flaw of Travis', it's an assumption that drives the narrative. Women who enjoy sex are dirty sluts who don't deserve respect in this story's world, and that's some sad internalized misogyny.Next up is how Travis is a textbook abuser archetype. He never hits Abby or any other woman in the book, but he exhibits every quality present in your average domestic abuser. He has a violent temper when he doesn't get his way:“He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! Please tell me!” she pleaded, her eyes glossing over. “It’s scaring me!”The fear in her eyes forced only the partial truth. “I just couldn’t say goodbye. You know it’s hard for me.”“It’s something else, Abby. He’s gone fucking nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you. He barged into Shep’s room, demanding to know where you were. Then he tried to call you. Over, and over and over,” she sighed. “His face was…Jesus, Abby. I’ve never seen him like that.“He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his door…broke it from the hinges! It was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life!”He's possessive, even after Abby's broken up with him:“I love you. I can’t let other guys dance with you.”He's quick to violence when he feels he's been insulted:Travis lifted Finch’s tray off the table and swung it into Chris’ face, knocking him off his chair. Chris tried to scramble under the table, but Travis pulled him out by his legs, and then began to wail on him.Chris curled into a ball, and then Travis kicked him in the back. Chris arched and turned, holding his hands out, allowing Travis to land several punches to his face. The blood began to flow, and Travis stood up, winded.And, most importantly, he sees nothing wrong with his behavior. I'm not a sheltered delicate flower. I'm a hockey fan who has been in her fair share of scraps over the years. I don't think a violent temper necessarily makes someone a predator. What makes Travis a predator, to my mind, is how his violent attacks on people outside the fight ring aren't treated as a personality flaw. These actions are not only not condemned by the characters or narrative, they're actually held up as examples of his love for and devotion to Abby. Viciously bloodying an innocent bystander's nose is treated as a heroic act.All that said, had this book ended at its halfway point, I think I would have begrudgingly given it 4* for being a cracktastic trip back to college to stroll down Bad Life Decisions Lane. It encapsulated the self-centered, impulsive, emotional and dramatic whirlwind that is young adulthood in a way adult contemporary romance does not. I know, as someone who graduated from college more than a decade ago, that Travis is bad news and that Abby's a head case, but college is the time for bad behavior. I would've liked an indication from the narrative that they were all screwed up and/or getting away with something, but it was seductive to go back to a time where you didn't know any better and you felt free to take crazy risks.Unfortunately, the author seems to have been unable to part with her characters and spent the second half writing her own fan fiction where Abby and Travis have Adventures! and break up and make up along the way. There's a beyond bizarre trip to Vegas that comes out of fucking nowhere. Abby's father is pointlessly introduced and forgotten about in an abrupt fashion. There's a throwaway sub-plot involving a mobster and a brush with death just to seal the deal. Where the first half of the book follows a nice dramatic arc, the second half is a half-witted sine wave shamelessly stalling the HEA. Bleh.In the end, the gratuitous violence, misogyny, poor writing and uneven pacing team up to make this a sub par read for me. I'm not going to wring my hands over the terrible message this sends to YA readers, because I don't think fiction works on people like that, but neither can I enjoy something with such glaring negative themes in it. McGuire has a knack for telling a story, but I can't ignore the flaws in this to enjoy it. 2*, error: I can't really be bothered to write my usual style of review. I'm the last person on the planet to read it, so summarizing the plot just seems a waste of time. Instead, I'm going to skip straight to my criticism.First off, if you don't like first person narration, this is not the book that will change your mind. It uses the device particularly poorly. Our narrator, the heroine, at times has too much insight into the minds of others and at other times has too little knowledge of her own mind. None of her personality comes through in the narration. She just describes what she and the people around her did, using a flat, emotionless sort of voice. It was like the story was written in third person then run through a find/replace to switch the pronouns. Abby thinks bizarre things like:I looked down to my plate, letting the long strands of my caramel hair create a curtain between us.and mangles grammar like:Kara was reading ahead in her brand-new books, grimacing at America and I when we walked in.Secondly, I think this early bit of characterization says it all about Travis:He had tattoos on opposite sides of his chest, and black tribal art covering each of his bulging shoulders.Since tribal tattoo = douchebag, the fact that he's a misogynist asshole didn't surprise me too much:“I don’t promise anyone anything, Pidge. She didn’t stipulate a relationship before she spread eagle on my couch.”I stared at the couch with revulsion. “She’s someone’s daughter, Travis. What if, down the line, someone treats your daughter like that?”“My daughter better not drop her panties for some jackass she just met, let’s put it that way.”Nice sex negative message there, don't you think? Abby the virgin is a good girl. All of Travis' past one night stands are referred to as \"sluts,\" \"bimbos,\" \"whores\" and \"Barbie dolls.\" Abby joins right in with Travis on the slut shaming, making it plain that the sexual double standard isn't just a character flaw of Travis', it's an assumption that drives the narrative. Women who enjoy sex are dirty sluts who don't deserve respect in this story's world, and that's some sad internalized misogyny.Next up is how Travis is a textbook abuser archetype. He never hits Abby or any other woman in the book, but he exhibits every quality present in your average domestic abuser. He has a violent temper when he doesn't get his way:“He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! Please tell me!” she pleaded, her eyes glossing over. “It’s scaring me!”The fear in her eyes forced only the partial truth. “I just couldn’t say goodbye. You know it’s hard for me.”“It’s something else, Abby. He’s gone fucking nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you.

            "Translation failed for: Foundation. The name is apt.Isaac Asimov's sprawling scifi tale is the rock on which much of today's space opera is built. Truer scifi historians than me would cite the late 1920s and pulp magazines such as Amazing Stories and E. E. \"Doc\" Smith as the DNA donors that spawned a thousand space operas. They would be right, but Asimov's fame towers above all others. His 1952 story of the decline and fall of the Galactic Empire is space opera's... foundation.Unfortunately, the analogy continues. Foundation has all the elements of poor writing that makes stuffy literary aristocrats stick their noses up at the genre. And rightfully so. Flat characters, a lack of economical yet creative prose, and endless dialogue are the genre's Achilles heel, and not in a cool Ilium way.This rant covers only Foundation itself. Despite owning an old edition which includes the entire original trilogy, I only managed to slog through the first book. Barely.The first chapter with Hari Seldon and a death-or-exile-decision was promising. But the plot device that makes the story potentially interesting also pulls it apart like the gravity of a gas giant. Foundation spans decades and with each shift into a new era, you're introduced to new characters. You learn almost nothing about them and in some scenes the dialogue is so pervasive, violating the hallowed \"show-don't-tell\" rule so thouroughly, I was actually unsure where these people were.One of my favorite parts of reading science fiction is being exposed to the new ideas of smart visionary authors. Good scifi ends up being right, cool or both. I obviously try to give anything as old as Foundation more of a pass on this front but I really didn't find any of its concepts mind-bending, or even mind-tickling. Psychohistory, as I understood it, was alright. I guess. Statistics.Dated elements abruptly eject the reader from the ever so important suspension of disbelief. For days I couldn't shake the scene where two characters shared a bunch of \"snuff\". I thought, is it reasonable that humans are still using tobacco products 12,000 years in the future?? And snuff?? Atomic energy is the big technology in the Foundation universe. That's like, fascinating, and stuff.Immediately after I \"finished\" Foundation, I picked up Scott Westerfeld's The Risen Empire. A quote on the cover claimed \"In the tradition of Asimov\". Uh oh. But wait. Intellegent turns of phrase? Break-neck action? Verisimilitude in the progression of civilizations? Technology that drives the plot, is extremely inventive and is extrapolated from today's knowledge base? Well-thought out characters whose behaviour makes sense but is not cardboard predictable? Other wicked-cool oddities like undead royal families? No snuff? Yes, I'm in the safe and familiar bio-tech embrace of a trusted friend: New Space Opera.Stories like Foundation are the reason why we even needed a New Space Opera in the first place. Unlike the misadventure of New Coke, this was a significant improvement on the original. The authors of this reinvigorated genre like Banks, Hamilton and Westerfeld (with all due respect to Stephen Baxter and his physics lectures some call novels) focus on quality writing, character development and social commentary. Oh and scientific accuracy verging on \"whooooa there\". A few, like Dan Simmons' georgeous Hyperion, are masterworks in any genre.All this poison being said, I can easily watch old GI Joe and He-Man cartoons and marvel at their sheer genius while a 10-year old today would brand me an idiot. Nostalgia is a shiny prism through which we all view our past. If I had not first read Foundation in my thirties but instead in my teens this review would like be entitled \"Asimov is like chewing on expensive snuff!\". But alas I am stuck with current me.This review also marks several times now that I give poor grades to scifi written prior to 1980. I'm a linear person: old before new, read things in order, cake before coffee, no spoilers please. So I've attempted to read Asimov, Niven, Pohl and I have to say: meh. I now vow brown cow to not feel guilty by skipping the basement of my favorite genre and instead enjoy the first floor, second floor, jacuzzi, balcony and pool. I'll get to that basement. One day. When it's raining. Ooo look a squirrel!Being a solid fan of New Space Opera, I must give proper respect to works upon whose shoulders it stands. I do so. But as with many of you, I have more books on my to-read list than I can tackle in a lifetime. I must prune and trim aggressively and I'm afraid the rest of the Foundation series is likely to end up on the greenhouse floor. Hopefully before I'm dust a clever New Space Opera idea about extending human life expectancy will give me more time to explore books about advanced civilizations prone to cancer of the mouth due to snuff addictions. Until then, I give thanks to the Old and say bring on the New., error: Foundation. Nazwa jest trafna. Rozległa opowieść science fiction Isaaca Asimova jest skałą, na której zbudowano większość dzisiejszej opery kosmicznej. Bardziej prawdziwi historycy science fiction niż ja wymieniliby późne lata 20. XX wieku i magazyny brukowe, takie jak Amazing Stories i E. E. „Doc” Smith, jako dawców DNA, którzy zrodzili tysiąc oper kosmicznych. Mieliby rację, ale sława Asimova góruje nad wszystkimi innymi. Jego opowieść z 1952 roku o upadku Imperium Galaktycznego jest... fundamentem opery kosmicznej. Niestety, analogia trwa. Foundation ma wszystkie elementy kiepskiego pisania, które sprawiają, że sztywni arystokraci literaccy zadzierają nosa z tym gatunkiem. I słusznie. Płaskie postacie, brak oszczędnej, ale kreatywnej prozy i niekończące się dialogi są piętą achillesową gatunku, i to nie w fajny sposób Ilium. Ta tyrada dotyczy tylko samej Foundation. Pomimo posiadania starego wydania, które zawiera całą oryginalną trylogię, udało mi się przebrnąć tylko przez pierwszą książkę. Ledwo. Pierwszy rozdział z Hari Seldonem i decyzją o śmierci lub wygnaniu był obiecujący. Ale zabieg fabularny, który sprawia, że ​​historia jest potencjalnie interesująca, również ją rozrywa jak grawitacja gazowego giganta. Fundacja obejmuje dekady i z każdym przejściem do nowej ery poznajesz nowe postacie. Nie dowiadujesz się o nich prawie nic, a w niektórych scenach dialogi są tak wszechobecne, łamiąc świętą zasadę „pokaż-nie-mów” tak dokładnie, że nie byłem pewien, gdzie są ci ludzie. Jedną z moich ulubionych części czytania science fiction jest wystawianie się na nowe pomysły inteligentnych, wizjonerskich autorów. Dobra science fiction kończy się tym, że jest dobra, fajna lub jedno i drugie. Oczywiście staram się dać czemuś tak staremu jak Fundacja więcej przepustki na tym froncie, ale naprawdę nie znalazłem żadnej z jej koncepcji zginającej umysł, ani nawet łechcącej umysł. Psychohistoria, tak jak ją rozumiałem, była w porządku. Chyba. Statystyki. Przestarzałe elementy nagle wytrącają czytelnika z tak ważnego zawieszenia niedowierzania. Przez kilka dni nie mogłem otrząsnąć się ze sceny, w której dwie postacie dzieliły się garścią „snuff”. Pomyślałem, czy to rozsądne, że ludzie nadal używają produktów tytoniowych 12 000 lat w przyszłości?? A tabaka?? Energia atomowa to wielka technologia we wszechświecie Fundacji. To takie fascynujące i takie tam. Zaraz po „skończeniu” Fundacji sięgnąłem po The Risen Empire Scotta Westerfelda. Cytat na okładce głosił „W tradycji Asimova”. Ojej. Ale czekaj. Inteligentne zwroty akcji? Szybka akcja? Prawdopodobieństwo w postępie cywilizacji? Technologia, która napędza fabułę, jest niezwykle pomysłowa i ekstrapolowana z dzisiejszej bazy wiedzy? Przemyślane postacie, których zachowanie ma sens, ale nie jest przewidywalne jak na tekturę? Inne niesamowicie fajne dziwactwa, takie jak nieumarłe rodziny królewskie? Żadnej tabaki? Tak, jestem w bezpiecznym i znajomym biotechnologicznym uścisku zaufanego przyjaciela: New Space Opera. Historie takie jak Foundation są powodem, dla którego w ogóle potrzebowaliśmy New Space Opera. W przeciwieństwie do niefortunnej przygody New Coke, była to znacząca poprawa oryginału. Autorzy tego odświeżonego gatunku, tacy jak Banks, Hamilton i Westerfeld (z całym szacunkiem dla Stephena Baxtera i jego wykładów z fizyki, które niektórzy nazywają powieściami), skupiają się na jakości pisania, rozwoju postaci i komentarzu społecznym. Och i dokładności naukowej graniczącej z „whooooa tam”. Kilku, jak wspaniały Hyperion Dana Simmonsa, to arcydzieła w każdym gatunku. Mimo wszystko mogę z łatwością oglądać stare kreskówki GI Joe i He-Man i zachwycać się ich czystym geniuszem, podczas gdy 10-latek dzisiaj nazwałby mnie idiotą. Nostalgia to błyszczący pryzmat, przez który wszyscy patrzymy na naszą przeszłość. Gdybym nie przeczytał Foundation po raz pierwszy w trzydziestce, ale w wieku nastoletnim, ta recenzja mogłaby nosić tytuł „Asimov jest jak żucie drogiej tabaki!”. Niestety, utknąłem w obecnym mnie. Ta recenzja oznacza również, że kilka razy wystawiam słabe oceny powieściom science fiction napisanym przed 1980 rokiem. Jestem osobą liniową: stare przed nowym, czytam rzeczy po kolei, ciasto przed kawą, proszę bez spoilerów. Więc próbowałem przeczytać Asimova, Nivena, Pohla i muszę powiedzieć: meh. Teraz ślubuję sobie, że nie będę czuł się winny, pomijając piwnicę mojego ulubionego gatunku, a zamiast tego będę cieszył się pierwszym, drugim piętrem, jacuzzi, balkonem i basenem. Dotrę do tej piwnicy. Pewnego dnia. Kiedy będzie padać. Ooo, spójrz na wiewiórkę! Jako zagorzały fan Nowej Opery Kosmicznej muszę okazać należyty szacunek dziełom, na których barkach ona spoczywa. Tak też czynię. Ale tak jak wielu z was, mam więcej książek do przeczytania na mojej liście, niż jestem w stanie przeczytać przez całe życie. Muszę przycinać i przycinać agresywnie i obawiam się, że reszta serii Foundation prawdopodobnie skończy na podłodze szklarni. Mam nadzieję, że zanim odkurzę, sprytny pomysł Nowej Opery Kosmicznej na temat wydłużenia oczekiwanej długości życia człowieka da mi więcej czasu na eksplorację książek o zaawansowanych cywilizacjach podatnych na raka jamy ustnej z powodu uzależnienia od tabaki. Do tego czasu dziękuję Staremu i mówię: niech nadejdzie Nowe. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

            "Translation failed for: 2.5 starsI almost gave it 3 stars and I feel that once this one settles a bit, it might reach that level. The issue here, you see, is that first 380 pages were nearly painful to get through. The last part? An above average action packed unravelling of events.The main problem is in Brandon Sanderson's exhausting and repetitive writing. And don't shout, \"HIGH FANTASY!\" at me because there is a difference between purposefully describing the flora and fauna or laying out expansive world systems and what Sanderson gives us, which is down right repetition. I highlighted an example of this:Still, they were marvelous. Instead of mundane browns and whites, the cultivatedplantswere of deeper, more vibrantcolors– shades of red, orange, andyellow, with thecolorsconcentrated in theirleaves. The groundskeepers hadplantedthem to make intricate, beautiful patterns. Closer to the balcony, exotictreeswithcolorful, yellow leavesgave shade protected from ashfalls. It was a very mild winter, and most of thetreesstill held theirleaves. The air felt cool, and the resting of branches in the wind weresoothing.Almostsoothingenough, in fact, to make Vin forget how annoyed she was.Think about paragraphs on paragraphs of this kind of simplicity and sameness of language. IT GRATES.On top of that, Sanderson had this habit of sharing character thoughts when they were completely useless to the scene. Behold:We'd have to discuss timing, though,\" Dockson said. \"Breeze is right- killing that many obligators in one evening means making a major commitment. It won't take the Inquisitors long to retaliate.\"Kelsier nodded.You're right, Dox. Timing will be vital.Um, we know timing will be vital because Dox just said that and we know you agree BECAUSE YOU NODDED.ON TOP OF THAT, there were a lot of plot points that Sanderson just beat over our head. For instance, the main character, Vin, grew up not trusting people, and often thought about the hard knock life lessons her brother Reen taught her. Reen is mentioned 33 times in the first 100 pages and at least 10 of those times, Vin is remembering something he told her with near exact, \"Reen had always said,\" language. Was all that really necessary to establish Vin as an untrusting person? She's already cowering in corners and well, you know, telling us she trusts no one. It was overkill.Those three things separately might seem minor, but in combination and across hundreds of pages? Struggle bus.This story is about a long con and sometimes it was so dragged out in getting us to where we were going, in ways that didn't feel necessary to either establish the world or characters or plot. We get the whole plan banged out and presented to us in a few pages and then that plan is repeated time and time again and we approach it at a snail's pace, all the while getting what little character progression we see thrown in our face: \"I used to not trust people, but now I kind of do.\" \"I used to be rash and reckless and now I will be... rash and recklessbut not that much.\"(Almost direct quotes.)As it is, I didn't even feel particularly connected to either the character or the world. To be sure, one of the characters I felt was most sympathetic,ends up dead. I thought to myself before that point, \"if this person dies, I'M OUT OF HERE.\" Wouldn't you know it, the death itself happens so quickly and is lost in the rest of the forward motion.It felt off in a way I can't describe better than that.Vin wasn't my favorite, but that is mostly due to the writing. As I said, within the first 100 pages, I wanted to punch her in the face because she was mostly having conversations in her head with Reen, or whatever. She's of course blessed with super powers the likes of which have never been seen, but she straddles this weird line of not trusting anyone and thrusting herself in places where she isn't always wanted? Like, \"I don't trust you BUT YOU MUST TRUST ME AND TAKE ME WITH YOU.\" Because she's the super special heroine, it works in her favor, but it doesn't work for her impression on me.Her love interest is established in like three meetings of polite conversation and that's it.

It feels like I'm reading someone's mediocre fan fiction intercut with instructions for a chemical reaction.\" GOOD JOB, ME. ACCURATE.It seems that Sanderson dedicated so much time to the Allomancy and the feudal system, but that doesn't actually mean he answered many of our burning questions. It seems like things were open to be addressed in the next book or two (why does it rain ash? why is the sun red? why does allomancy exist? why why why why?) and that's all well and good, but does that mean you spent hundreds of pages setting this up ONLY TO DIRECT US TO THE NEXT SET OF HUNDREDS OF PAGES FOR ANSWERS?

            "Translation failed for: Prologue:There was an echo of three parts. The first echo was the most obvious one. It told of promises unfullfilled, questions unanswered and time invested. It was an echo of frustration.The second echo was more subtle. A yawning of the mind reverberating through synapses untrained.

I sat in the cinema to see the newest Johnny Depp movie, an epic 5 hour piece about film-making.I had my glases on, a six-pack of beer and my nachos. I always had nachos. With cheese that could stretch as long as the wheel of time.As the movie started I was excited. There he was. Johnny Depp. He entered a white room. Nobody entered a room like Johnny Depp. It was graceful, an art of walking never to be seen again. A walking dead to our modern society, lost on an island of purgatory.In the white room a simple chair awaited Johnny and there he sat. As simple as that. Sat there like noone else could, beautifully, but without moving again.After two hours of watching Johnny Depp sitting in 3D, I fell asleep and found myself transported into the white room.\"Hello there,\" said Johnny Depp.\"Wow, I mean, hi,\" I said.\"So, what are you doing in my movie?\" asked Johnny Depp. Nobody asked a question as eloquently as Johnny Depp.\"What are you doing here, Johnny Depp? You do nothing since 2 hours, you just sit there! Where's the movie?\" I asked.\"Well, does there have to be action in it? Can't it just be beautiful without anything happening?\" Johnny asked uniquely.\"But what's the point?\" I inquired.\"It's not a movie. It's a movie about movie-making and therefore it needs no real movie.\"\"Now my head hurts,\" I said. \"You confuse me in my own dream. Wait a minute. It is my dream, isn't it?\"\"It is, I believe,\" said Johnny. \"Let me guess. You ask yourself why you're talking to me, when you could talk to, let's say, a sexy actress?\" He smiled at that.\"Yeah,\" I admitted, shifting my foot uncomfortably.\"Allright then, which sexy actress do you like?\" Johnny asked.\"Rachelle LeFevre, she's adorable!\" I said without hesitation.\"Can't do that, she's still trapped under the dome at CBS. You know how they are, you don't wanna mess with them.\"\"That's true,\" I said. \"Well, may I then speak with Natalie Portman?\"\"Of course,\" said Natalie Portman. Wow, this Johnny Depp was a fantastic actor!\"What a great white room this is,\" she said. \"It would be the perfect set for a movie about movie-making.\"\"Really?\" I asked.\"Definately! So, what do you want to talk about? The Black Swan?\"\"Oh wow, I didn't know you were into the New Avengers, Natalie Portman. She's one of my favourite characters there.\"Natalie looked puzzled and remained silent.\"Well,\" I said. \"I want to write this review about a book I wasn't that fond of and I don't know how to start.\"\"Really? For somebody who doesn't know how to start, you wrote a lot already. Do you think somebody is still reading at this time?\"\"Probably not,\" I admitted.\"Anyway,\" Natalie said. \"Shouldn't you start with summary of what happened?\"\"I'm not so sure there happened anything, like in this movie.\"\"So, who is the main character?\" Natalie asked.\"He's called Kvothe.\" I said.\"Shut up! I know him. He's great, we're Facebook friends!\" Natalie produced a laptop from out of nowhere. That Johnny Depp is really sleight of hand, if you ask me.\"So, let me see,\" she said. \"Ah there he is. Look at his status update: Still at the university, took a term off to work for a foreign government. Did a lot of camping there, picked up karate and a new language, got laid a lot. Fun summer.\"\"Does he say anything about his relation with Denna?\" I asked.\"Relationship status says: It's complicated,\" replied Natalie. \"So, where is your problem? This seems to be great content for a nice novella of 150 pages.\"\"Yep, but it's a 1000+ pages book.\" I said.\"Is it beautifully written?\" she asked.\"I suppose,\" I supposed.\"Then where's your problem? Get your shit together!\"\"Wow, Natalie Portman. You just said \"shit\" on a public review.\"\"I said \"fuck\" on Conan O'Brien last year, so what?\"\"True dat. So, one last question, Natalie. If you know Kvothe, why is he so irresistable to women in the book. I mean...would you...you know...?\"\"Oh, of course, if I wasn't in a happy relationship and had a baby. He's just great, it doesn't have to be logical. You know, it's still called fantasy.\"Chapter 3:\"That wasn't much of a review at all!\" screamed the eager listener.\"Does it have to be?\" the reviewer asked.\"Of course! What good is a review, where you review nothing?\"\"It has the same value as a story about storytelling without telling a story.\" the reviewer explained.\"But aren't you afraid that nobody likes your review?\"\"Not at all. If you like a story without story, then you like a review without review. And if you don't like the review, you may not like the story and therefore like the review. I can't loose,\" said the reviewer.\"But what if somebody likes the story, but hates your review?\"The reviewer smiled.\"Now that, my friend, is a wise man's fear!\"Epilogue:There was a hope of three parts. The first part was a rustling of pages, of future deeds and revelations. It was a hope of satisfaction.The second part was a quickening of pace, of new places and faces.

The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (🚨). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly.This is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She’s whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf.Whoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, becauseit takes all the important themes outand leaves just the bare plotline:1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section.2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it’s still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse).The problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It’s just nonsensical.How is that a punishment at all?She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she’s away from the poor village.However, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn’t add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed.In Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It’s a mystery.So anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as “punishment,” but she’s still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt.She falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he’s not a Beast. There’s no barrier to overcome here.She isn’t forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior.Along the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there’s no conflict whatsoever.The only problems arise from Feyre’s own stupidity.Their exchanges basically go like this:Lucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away.Feyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!Everything is far too easy for Feyre.She’s supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don’t line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it’s fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin… etc.If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.Lucien: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Tamlin: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Literally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Feyre: *gets a midnight snack*Feyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that’s supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever.The result is thatthe danger does not feel genuine.It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin.Speaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he’s such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there’s nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he’s much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section.And then we have the writing, which is just bad. “...” is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre’s bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what’s up with the phrase “my bowels turned watery?” It’s used at least twice and I don’t like it at all. This is notShatter Me.🚨🚨🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨🚨🚨So, what’s up with Amarantha?I really do like her. She’s a compelling villain because she’s (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.)Basically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses… well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn’t be enough left of Feyre to burn.However, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle.This is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It’s not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn’t great. And worst of all, the answer?It’s love.The answer is love.How does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle?She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it.Anyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her.It was far too easy.Moving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He’s a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can’t believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I’m suing. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand how people love him. He’s abusive, uncomfy, and weird.People keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it.Second of all,if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that’s bad writing.Finally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse.🚨🚨🚨END OF SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨In conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole.Also, I wrote a rap.

            "Translation failed for: Clearly I'm in the minority here. DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail's pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions ofBeauty and the Beastthat I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I feltCruel Beautyamong other B&B retellings I've read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I'm sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything's just dandy and things will make sense, and I'd be like \"ooooooh, so that's why ____.\" Me, I don't care. Ain't nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I'm just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who's implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here's roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there's Belle's dad. Belle's dad wanders into Beast's castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn't like the fact that Belle's dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle's dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle's valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There's a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book.Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here's this version of Beauty and the Beast,a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely,from the little that I have read.There'sFeyrewho has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don't care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there's only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who's a Fae in disguise) away from her family.“What is the payment the Treaty requires?”His eyes didn’t leave my face as he said, “A life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.”A life for a life!Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That's what a life for a life means, right?WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.“Some would say it’s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,” Tamlin ground out. “Some would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.”So what?!Why?!This makes no sense at all.Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother.In exchange, there isabsolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.Another useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis’s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic—this one of purple so deep it could have been black.Clearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they're revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape.It doesn't make any sense!“There is … a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act … strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks”—he tapped on his—“are the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can’t remove them.”Over and over and over,the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.“So there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?” Maybe they’d know how to free me from the Treaty’s terms.“Yes,” he said tightly. “The Suriel. But they’re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.And then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn't feel like it, because she is \"inconsequential.\" In fact, they're more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.“My morning work was postponed,” he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. “If you want a ride across the grounds—if you’re interested in your new … residence, I can take you.”And teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle's love for reading.“I could help you write to them, if that’s why you’re in here.”Feyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.“Do you ever stop being such a prick?” I snapped back.Dead—really, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. “Much better.”As I said, I'm sure this book improves in the end, but from what I've read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue., error: Clearly I'm in the minority here. DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail's pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions ofBeauty and the Beastthat I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I feltCruel Beautyamong other B&B retellings I've read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I'm sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything's just dandy and things will make sense, and I'd be like \"ooooooh, so that's why ____.\" Me, I don't care. Ain't nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I'm just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who's implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here's roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there's Belle's dad. Belle's dad wanders into Beast's castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn't like the fact that Belle's dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle's dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle's valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There's a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point.

I certainly have no say on what Cashore did or did not intend the book to say. I only can say with certainty whatIfind in the book and I hope you can agree that if, in addition to great writing and engaging stories, one desires one's reading material to have at the very least some simple ethics, it is more than reasonable that some readers will discuss and debate the ethics and social mores that certain features of this book present. Personally, I appreciate being able to discuss something that a book mentions and which allows me to think of it in an entirely different light.I am fully aware that many might feel that this review is biased and unfair, written from a narrow-minded, hidebound mentality. How dare I allow my personal convictions to color my view of a book I read? Especially a fantasy book that clearly takes place in a world that is not this one. But before you comment to let me know that I am a horrible disgrace and disappointment as a human for allowing my personal convictions to color my view of a book that I have read, please take a moment to know that I am not allowing any comments on this review. I had nearly 50 comments on this review and I ultimately chose to delete them when the vitriolic, contemptuous comments kept coming. For those of you whose opinions differed, but who chose to share that contrary opinion with civility and tolerance, I would like once more to extend my sincerest thanks, especially to Ariel and Angie. For the others that commented to agree or say thanks for the review, I hope it helped.So, back to that however. My issue is that firstly, what Po and Katsa have is not love. Infatuation? Certainly. Affection? Sure. But love, \"true love,\" is wanting what is best for the other person and doing whatever one can so that the other is able to move toward the best. Thus, love is at its core sacrificial and giving. What is the purpose of Katsa's and Po's sexual relationship? It is of transient emotional and physical benefit, but how does it benefit them ultimately? I don’t believe that love equals sex, and the book seemed to infer just that.But say she did love him. I'm all for girl power and females don't need a guy to be fulfilled. All for that. I even understand that at that point in Katsa's life she had just claimed her freedom and could not imagine entering any other station of life that would in any way limit or curtail her personal liberty. All well and fine. But then she goes ahead and enters into a physical relationship with a guy because she \"loves\" him, but just can't ever be \"married\" to him because that would limit her sense of self and her own freedom to come and go as she pleased. Granted, the concept of marriage within the confines of that secondary world might differ, it could be a total abnegation of self, but I never got that sense when they talked about marriages in their society. In fact, at its core, marriage (in our world) is a contract of personal commitment between two people, but Katsa, while perhaps legitimately shunning marriage in her world, still has no desire to ever commit to Po inanyway. So it would seem that Katsa's issues had way more to do with herself and her own flaws and insecurities than the idea of commitment or even Po. Given his affection for her, he would never have limited her freedom. But flip the coin. What if it was Po who “loved” Katsa, but refused to marry her because then he would not be free? Where he was the one who would take whatever Katsa had to offer, but did not care enough to actually make any sort of commitment to her? That likely would not go over as well. It is strange what a double standard we have in relationships, esp. in a \"feminist\" age. We praise novels that show females as strong, independent individuals, even if that means they are also selfish and controlling, while we quite rightly condemn that sort of behavior in male protagonists. But then not only are we giving a sad view of a \"strong\" woman, as if that is the only way to portray a vibrant and intelligent female, we are also touting a weak and ineffective masculine image that indicates that no male can be resourceful or a leader or else he is preventing the girl from being who she ought to be free to be...etc. When we did we stop striving for an ideal where both men and women complimented each other, each being allowed their own strengths, and being equals rather than always rivals and competitors?So, again, a talented new author, but I have deep reservations about some of the messages in this book and I doubt I will recommend it to many people. Which is a shame considering the quality of the rest of the story, which is easily three stars for the prose, though the plot had a few spots that seemed out of place.Gracelingnever seemed like it should have been a love story (much less a hook-up), and I was loving it as a fine fantasy/ personal growth novel, but once they brought in the romantic/ anti-romantic elements, it lost me., error: I wanted so badly to like this book.

That would sound really weird, unlike Greening Grandemalion, which is a name someone would normally give to their child. Yeah...If you have any more suggestions about what the names fromGracelingsound like, feel free to put it in the comments!Note:Next up is the review, which is very thorough about the issues ofGraceling'sworldbuilding. This is going to take a while, but stay with me. Thanks.Actual Rating:2.5 starsWhen reviewers criticizeGraceling, they often complain about the view on feminism. I think enough has been said about that, so for detailed reviews about that issue, I recommend Amanda's review and Tatiana's review.However, this isn'tGraceling'sonly flaw. The other big problem is the black-and-white world-building.World ofGracelingGracelingis set in a european-ish medieval land with horses, taverns, kings, castles, and anything else you would except to find in such a place. The land is divided into seven kingdoms: Lienid (the island kingdom), Monsea (a kingdom closed off by the mountains), Middluns (the middle kingdom), and Nander, Estill, Sunder, Wester, which surround Middluns on the North, East, South, and West side, respectively. (See what Cashore did there?) Another aspect is the Graced; some people are born with special abilities called \"Graces\" such as mind-reading, excellent swimming skills, killing, etc. There is great prejudice against the Graced (except in Lienid) and one can tell if another person is Graced if the person's eyes are mismatched colors. (Random comment: One of my friends has eyes like this. It's a condition called heterochromia iridum. But sadly, my friend has no superpowers. :( ) Anyways...I think we can all agree that European medieval worlds are definitely overdone;nearly every epic fantasy or high fantasy is set in one! However, authors can still make them fresh if they add complexity to them with new aspects or intriguing history.Examples of Fresh, Intriguing WorldsFor example, in Cinda Williams Chima'sSeven Realms, the generic fantasy world is made fresh by complex struggles between Gray Wolf Queens, Clan, and Wizards. There is a well-developed and unique culture in the world, stemming from the struggles between Clan and Wizards, and the history is complex and believable.Another example isThe Well Between the Worlds. It is a retelling of the King Arthur tale, set in a medieval world, but adds the elements of the Wells, the sinking of Lyonnesse, and industrialization to make a breathtakingly fresh and original world.So, what's the matter withGraceling'sworld?WhyGraceling'sWorld-building Simply Isn't Good EnoughFirst off, there are only a few fresh aspects of this world:1.) The idea of the Graced2.) Some cultural aspects of the Lienid (like the gold jewelry, Po's tattoos, and the ring/inheritance thing....and that's pretty much it.But there's got to be more! Anything! Tell me,is there...A religion?No.History?(Like references to why the kingdoms are how they are, etc?) Nope.Mythology/legends/storiesabout old heroes, Graced, etc.? No.Unique cultural aspects?None.Anything that separates the world of Graceling from other fantasies?I'm sorry, but there is, other than the Graced, nothing original here.Okay, okay, we get it! Nothing new here! But sometimes, generic fantasy worlds are complex. There are complex issues, complex characters, and complex motivations which make up for the lack of originality. In fact, a world lacking new ideas sometimes portrays old ideas in a new light! What about Graceling? Is there any complexity?Lack of complexity in GracelingPart One: The Inhabitants of the worldEEEEEEVIL PEOPLE:- The villain,King Leck.Why is he evil? Because he is! What does he do? Torture animals! He evenkilled his own wife!He is so EEEEEVIL!- King Randa. Poor Katsa! Her EEEEEEVIL uncle is making her kill people! Does he feel the slightest guilt or remorse? No! Does he have a good reason for this? Yes, so he can be evenmorepowerful! MWAHAHAHAHA!- Those other kings! (Except for King Ror, who is good.) They are always squabbling over borders and killing poor peasants and stuff. How horrible of them! They are so EEEEEVIL! And one of them evenheld a poor old guy prisoner, just so he could be rich!MEAN people- Basically, everyone non-Graced. They just don't understand what it's like! Now that I think about it, all of Katsa's friends are either Graced or have a family member who is Graced (or are Lienid). The only exception is Oll.- Giddon. He is so condescending! And he doesn't understand Katsa! And he's so stupid, he thinks he can protect her! Even when she can kick his ass! This portrayal bugs me, because it feels like a gimmick to show how good Katsa is, and how she deserves a good man in her life, and blah blah blah.GOOD PEOPLE- Katsa is forced to kill people by her uncle. But wait, she is really good! Don't believe me? She created an organization called The Council, which does nice stuff! She is so angelic! Admittedly, Cashore did give her a few personality flaws, but not enough. I mean, when you can kill and entire army without even a sword, wouldn't you be extremely selfish and extremely spoiled? I admit, I would be.- Po. He is SOOOO noble! He still loves Katsa even ifshe won't marry him.And his secret is OK. Yes, Katsa is mad, but he is SOOOOOOO nice she doesn't care.- Lienid people! They are so nice to the Graced! They respect them 'n stuff.- Everyone not in the MEAN or EEEEEVL section. They are brave, noble, etc. No one is ever a mixture of good and evil.Part Two: The World ItselfThe world ofGracelinglacks nuance. When you look at the history of Europe, there are ancient alliances, complex relations, etc. between the countries. Not to mention, the citizens of each country see themselves in one way and see people from other countries in other way. There are stereotypes, symbols, legends, and histories that may or may not be real. (And not just in Europe, everywhere.)I was expecting well-developed relations between the kingdoms and between normal people and Graced people. I mean, Katsa and Po have to travel across many countries and I wanted to see them struggle against prejudices and stereotypes.However, they had had it extremely easy. Here is the extent to which all the relationships were developed:- Normal people hate the Graced! (For no apparent reason) All you see is a strong dislike, no complex feelings. (For example, being in awe of their powers, yet feeling jealous)- Kingdoms fight over borders. That is pretty much it. Their only dislike comes from border squabbles.And... that's about it.Anyways, readingGracelingwas an underwhelming experience. I mean, the first time I read it, I was in middle school, and even then I was disappointed!Recommendations:Many people loved this book. You might too, if you:1.) Love a good kick-ass heroine2.) Are looking for a fun adventure3.) Want lots of action in your fantasy4.) Love reading about kind, noble men in love with misfit girlsBut you might not if you:1.) Are looking for a deep exploration of feminist ideas2.) Require complex, original world-building3.) Need complex characters4.) Want a complex plotFinal Comment:Gracelingisn't a bad book. For me it was 2.5 stars (2.5 = a little more enjoyable than \"meh\") There is some decent character development, some exciting action, and a somewhat original plot. Also, other than the overwrought feminism,Gracelingdoesn't have any big flaws that might insult the reader and completely ruin the reading experience. There was also some humor and some quotable moments, my favorite being,“When a monster stopped behaving like a monster, did it stop being a monster? Did it become something else?”during a moment of poignant character introspection. (Speaking of that, there were some great ideas concerning what it means to be a monster.) All of this made Graceling an OK book. However,Gracelingfeels like an edited draft - there are good ideas, good editing, but nothing is really fleshed out. Let's hope in future books, Cashore spends more time on her story.Alternatives:- For a complex fantasy,Seven Realmsis an terrific four-book series. Book 1 (The Demon King) is mostly a set-up book, with fantastic world-building, but familiar (and somewhat cliche) characters. Book 2 (The Exiled Queen) is great; the characters deepen, and the plot thickens. Book 3 (The Gray Wolf Throne) is absolutely stunning; intricate plotlines come perfectly together, characterization is amazing, and the tension is almost unbearable. And Book 4 (The Crimson Crown) is the kind of book so jaw-droppingly amazing, you feel like crying just because the book ENDED.- For a (urban-ish) fantasy/Para-Normal Romance, (don't worry, there romance isn't annoying]) with a totally kick-ass heroine, original world-building, and gorgeous prose, check outDaughter of Smoke and Boneby Laini Taylor.- For a short, rich fantasy (that won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award) with a strong heroine who is selfish (but gets better) and has a coming-of-age story, I recommend Franny Billingsley'sThe Folk Keeper. There is also an exciting mystery (with more than one twist), and just the tiniest dash of romance. Plus, as a bonus, the prose is lovely.- I've heard that theThe Queen's Thiefseries by Megan Whalen Turner are fantastic, especially those after book 1 (The Thief.) I admit, I have not read them yet, but book 1 won the Newberry Honor medal, and many \"picky\" reviewers say they are fantastic.-The Well Between the Worldsby Sam Llewelyn is also a terrific, original novel. Yes, it is a children's book (ages 10+) but so wasHis Dark Materials. And just likeHis Dark Materials, TWBTW is sophisticated, well-written, and a lot of fun. And isn't it said that a good children's book can be enjoyed by adults as well?Anyways, I hope this review helps anyone thinking about whether or not they should readGraceling.Random:Those of you not familiar with the Teletubbies theme song, this might seem weird.

Graceling people... say... he... llo!, error: What I think about when I hear the name...Po:-Po the Panda-Po from Telletubbies- A crazy guy (like Edgar Allen Poe)- PooKatsa:- Ketchup- Mutant KatnissRor:-Roar! I'm a T-Rex!Tealiff:- Tea LeafSkye:- Skype- A modern name, which you will NOT find in a medieval place.King Randa:- Ranting + Panda. King Ranting Panda!Drowden:- Drowsy- DrowningThigpen- Pig pen- Thinking penLeck- Lick- Peck- Neck- Smack- Some other variationLienid:- An insult. (\"Hey, youLienid!\")By the way, Po's real name is Greening Grandemalion. Great, at least its notYellowingGrandemalion orPurplingGrandemalion or something stupid like that. That would sound really weird, unlike Greening Grandemalion, which is a name someone would normally give to their child. Yeah...If you have any more suggestions about what the names fromGracelingsound like, feel free to put it in the comments!Note:Next up is the review, which is very thorough about the issues ofGraceling'sworldbuilding. This is going to take a while, but stay with me. Thanks.Actual Rating:2.5 starsWhen reviewers criticizeGraceling, they often complain about the view on feminism. I think enough has been said about that, so for detailed reviews about that issue, I recommend Amanda's review and Tatiana's review.However, this isn'tGraceling'sonly flaw. The other big problem is the black-and-white world-building.World ofGracelingGracelingis set in a european-ish medieval land with horses, taverns, kings, castles, and anything else you would except to find in such a place. The land is divided into seven kingdoms: Lienid (the island kingdom), Monsea (a kingdom closed off by the mountains), Middluns (the middle kingdom), and Nander, Estill, Sunder, Wester, which surround Middluns on the North, East, South, and West side, respectively. (See what Cashore did there?) Another aspect is the Graced; some people are born with special abilities called \"Graces\" such as mind-reading, excellent swimming skills, killing, etc. There is great prejudice against the Graced (except in Lienid) and one can tell if another person is Graced if the person's eyes are mismatched colors. (Random comment: One of my friends has eyes like this. It's a condition called heterochromia iridum. But sadly, my friend has no superpowers. :( ) Anyways...I think we can all agree that European medieval worlds are definitely overdone;nearly every epic fantasy or high fantasy is set in one! However, authors can still make them fresh if they add complexity to them with new aspects or intriguing history.Examples of Fresh, Intriguing WorldsFor example, in Cinda Williams Chima'sSeven Realms, the generic fantasy world is made fresh by complex struggles between Gray Wolf Queens, Clan, and Wizards. There is a well-developed and unique culture in the world, stemming from the struggles between Clan and Wizards, and the history is complex and believable.Another example isThe Well Between the Worlds. It is a retelling of the King Arthur tale, set in a medieval world, but adds the elements of the Wells, the sinking of Lyonnesse, and industrialization to make a breathtakingly fresh and original world.So, what's the matter withGraceling'sworld?WhyGraceling'sWorld-building Simply Isn't Good EnoughFirst off, there are only a few fresh aspects of this world:1.) The idea of the Graced2.) Some cultural aspects of the Lienid (like the gold jewelry, Po's tattoos, and the ring/inheritance thing....and that's pretty much it.But there's got to be more! Anything! Tell me,is there...A religion?No.History?(Like references to why the kingdoms are how they are, etc?) Nope.Mythology/legends/storiesabout old heroes, Graced, etc.? No.Unique cultural aspects?None.Anything that separates the world of Graceling from other fantasies?I'm sorry, but there is, other than the Graced, nothing original here.Okay, okay, we get it! Nothing new here! But sometimes, generic fantasy worlds are complex. There are complex issues, complex characters, and complex motivations which make up for the lack of originality. In fact, a world lacking new ideas sometimes portrays old ideas in a new light! What about Graceling? Is there any complexity?Lack of complexity in GracelingPart One: The Inhabitants of the worldEEEEEEVIL PEOPLE:- The villain,King Leck.Why is he evil? Because he is! What does he do? Torture animals! He evenkilled his own wife!He is so EEEEEVIL!- King Randa. Poor Katsa! Her EEEEEEVIL uncle is making her kill people! Does he feel the slightest guilt or remorse? No! Does he have a good reason for this? Yes, so he can be evenmorepowerful! MWAHAHAHAHA!- Those other kings! (Except for King Ror, who is good.) They are always squabbling over borders and killing poor peasants and stuff. How horrible of them! They are so EEEEEVIL! And one of them evenheld a poor old guy prisoner, just so he could be rich!MEAN people- Basically, everyone non-Graced. They just don't understand what it's like! Now that I think about it, all of Katsa's friends are either Graced or have a family member who is Graced (or are Lienid). The only exception is Oll.- Giddon. He is so condescending! And he doesn't understand Katsa! And he's so stupid, he thinks he can protect her! Even when she can kick his ass! This portrayal bugs me, because it feels like a gimmick to show how good Katsa is, and how she deserves a good man in her life, and blah blah blah.GOOD PEOPLE- Katsa is forced to kill people by her uncle. But wait, she is really good! Don't believe me? She created an organization called The Council, which does nice stuff! She is so angelic! Admittedly, Cashore did give her a few personality flaws, but not enough. I mean, when you can kill and entire army without even a sword, wouldn't you be extremely selfish and extremely spoiled? I admit, I would be.- Po. He is SOOOO noble! He still loves Katsa even ifshe won't marry him.And his secret is OK. Yes, Katsa is mad, but he is SOOOOOOO nice she doesn't care.- Lienid people! They are so nice to the Graced! They respect them 'n stuff.- Everyone not in the MEAN or EEEEEVL section. They are brave, noble, etc. No one is ever a mixture of good and evil.Part Two: The World ItselfThe world ofGracelinglacks nuance. When you look at the history of Europe, there are ancient alliances, complex relations, etc. between the countries. Not to mention, the citizens of each country see themselves in one way and see people from other countries in other way. There are stereotypes, symbols, legends, and histories that may or may not be real. (And not just in Europe, everywhere.)I was expecting well-developed relations between the kingdoms and between normal people and Graced people. I mean, Katsa and Po have to travel across many countries and I wanted to see them struggle against prejudices and stereotypes.However, they had had it extremely easy. Here is the extent to which all the relationships were developed:- Normal people hate the Graced! (For no apparent reason) All you see is a strong dislike, no complex feelings. (For example, being in awe of their powers, yet feeling jealous)- Kingdoms fight over borders. That is pretty much it. Their only dislike comes from border squabbles.And... that's about it.Anyways, readingGracelingwas an underwhelming experience. I mean, the first time I read it, I was in middle school, and even then I was disappointed!Recommendations:Many people loved this book. You might too, if you:1.) Love a good kick-ass heroine2.) Are looking for a fun adventure3.) Want lots of action in your fantasy4.) Love reading about kind, noble men in love with misfit girlsBut you might not if you:1.) Are looking for a deep exploration of feminist ideas2.) Require complex, original world-building3.) Need complex characters4.) Want a complex plotFinal Comment:Gracelingisn't a bad book. For me it was 2.5 stars (2.5 = a little more enjoyable than \"meh\") There is some decent character development, some exciting action, and a somewhat original plot. Also, other than the overwrought feminism,Gracelingdoesn't have any big flaws that might insult the reader and completely ruin the reading experience. There was also some humor and some quotable moments, my favorite being,“When a monster stopped behaving like a monster, did it stop being a monster? Did it become something else?”during a moment of poignant character introspection. (Speaking of that, there were some great ideas concerning what it means to be a monster.) All of this made Graceling an OK book. However,Gracelingfeels like an edited draft - there are good ideas, good editing, but nothing is really fleshed out. Let's hope in future books, Cashore spends more time on her story.Alternatives:- For a complex fantasy,Seven Realmsis an terrific four-book series. Book 1 (The Demon King) is mostly a set-up book, with fantastic world-building, but familiar (and somewhat cliche) characters. Book 2 (The Exiled Queen) is great; the characters deepen, and the plot thickens. Book 3 (The Gray Wolf Throne) is absolutely stunning; intricate plotlines come perfectly together, characterization is amazing, and the tension is almost unbearable. And Book 4 (The Crimson Crown) is the kind of book so jaw-droppingly amazing, you feel like crying just because the book ENDED.- For a (urban-ish) fantasy/Para-Normal Romance, (don't worry, there romance isn't annoying]) with a totally kick-ass heroine, original world-building, and gorgeous prose, check outDaughter of Smoke and Boneby Laini Taylor.- For a short, rich fantasy (that won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award) with a strong heroine who is selfish (but gets better) and has a coming-of-age story, I recommend Franny Billingsley'sThe Folk Keeper. There is also an exciting mystery (with more than one twist), and just the tiniest dash of romance. Plus, as a bonus, the prose is lovely.- I've heard that theThe Queen's Thiefseries by Megan Whalen Turner are fantastic, especially those after book 1 (The Thief.) I admit, I have not read them yet, but book 1 won the Newberry Honor medal, and many \"picky\" reviewers say they are fantastic.-The Well Between the Worldsby Sam Llewelyn is also a terrific, original novel. Yes, it is a children's book (ages 10+) but so wasHis Dark Materials. And just likeHis Dark Materials, TWBTW is sophisticated, well-written, and a lot of fun. And isn't it said that a good children's book can be enjoyed by adults as well?Anyways, I hope this review helps anyone thinking about whether or not they should readGraceling.Random:Those of you not familiar with the Teletubbies theme song, this might seem weird.

Katsa shows very little, if any, personal growth over the course of this novel. Also, I felt like the author spent too much time trying to sell us on the following ideas: femininity is an idea forced upon women by the patriarchy, men don't respect women, commitment ruins relationships, marriage is a tool of the devil, and so on.Look, I understand thatsomewomen feel that way, and I'm completely cool with it. I'd be lying if I claimed that I've never thought some of the same things during my lifetime. That said, I hate how the author seems to be shoving very specific views down my throat instead of telling me a story that challenges me to think for myself.This book is written in such a way that it makes me think Cashore, the author, is using her character, her story as a vehicle to voice her very strong opinions. Don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily have a problem with that sort of thing, it's just that this book is being touted as 'feminist' but I fail to see true feminism within the pages of this book. I mean, I guess you could consider it a version of feminism, but it's not very inclusionary. In fact, it's a very bigoted version of feminism.Other than Katsa every other woman in this book is portrayed as weak and dumb. So basically unless you're an angry, dress-hating, man-hating woman with an aversion to commitment there is something wrong with you.News Flash: femininity isn't anti-feminist. I'm sorry but it is possible for independent, intelligent and stable women to embrace femininity without losing credibility. And anyway, isn't that the point of the feminist movement? Gaining equality without having to act like 'one of the guys'? I mean, sure, you can reject femininity if you want, but don't go around assuming that those who are feminine are pathetic weakling losers who do nothing to help the cause.It just so turns outthatline of thought is backward and does nothing to advance the cause.Also, Katsa's view of other women in the realm is quite condescending in that she never seems to consider how privileged she is compared to some of these other women. Katsa's lucky in that she has the ability to kill pretty much anyone she wants so it's not like she has to do a damn thing anyone tells her to do. Despite all the crap shesupposedly has toput up with, Katsa has benefitted from an education and she's also afforded more freedoms than most women because someone else pays her bills. She doesn't have to milk the cows or churn butter or become a serving wench. She doesn't have to prostitute herself out in order to make ends meet.Girlfriend needs to shut the hell up about all that because it's not like she's doing anything other than making a-hole observations. Katsa's not doing anything to change the way all women in the realm are treated, which is fine, it's her life, whatever. She just needs to quit it with the judgmental attitude toward others who can't afford to live or think the way she does.I could have handled Katsa's aversion to having a relationship with Poe if she hadn't had any feelings for him, or if she knew she wasn't emotionally ready to make any sort of commitment. But no, Katsa's aversion to commitment was built up do be some great personal strength of hers.In the end it just felt like she ('she' being Katsa. Or Cashore.Kat-Shore?) was trying to prove a point or something, like \"look at how independent I am. I'm not a barnacle. I don'tneeda man...except for when I needs teh sex. So Poe, my lover, sorry you lost your sight and all but I'll prolly be drunk-dialing you in the future, cause I am comfortable with my sexuality. kthanxbai.\" *sob* \"Walking away is waaaaay hard, which is why I amsostrong.\" *sob* \"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrl Powerrrrrr!\"Yeah, because being in a loving, trusting, equal and committed relationship isn't a sign of strength. Strength can only be had byloners who don't like to commit because doing so will supposedly lower their self-worth...ummm....I mean...\"independent\" people.Also, it has to be said: The love scene grosses me out as much or more than the sex scene(s) in Titanic and/or Avatar. Some people just don't know how to write a love scene. James Cameron and Kristin Cashore are among that group.One last thing: why is it that no one seems to have an issue with Katsa hitting Po, literally knocking him to the ground so hard that he bruises? All he did was voice his opinion, that's it. Had the tables been turned, had Po hit Katsa for voicing her opinion, you people would be unbelievably angry. I'm sure some of you would be burning Cashore in effigy.Let's do a little more of this whole turning tables thing. Pretend that Katsa is actually a male character and Po is female. Okay, how much do you love this new topsy-turvy version of Graceling? Not very much, you say? Yeah, I thought so.If you ask me Katsa is one of the least deserving protagonists. She's a violent, judgmental a-hole who shows little to no personal growth over the course of this entire book. I don't care if she had a difficult childhood, having a difficult childhood doesn't mean you have to go around inflicting the worst parts of yourself on others. Having a difficult childhood doesn't give you license to be an awful person.Two stars because the concept was cool.

            "Translation failed for: Actual rating: 2.5Levi said. “It’s hard for me to get my head around. It’s like hearing that Harry Potter is gay.\"Ok, why the fuck are you referencing Harry Potter after having based the entire book around a fictionalized version of Harry Potter known as Simon Snow? Why?!If you wanted a true sense of fandom, don't look for it here.Don't get me wrong,I liked this book, but it is a coming-of-age book that was misrepresented as a book about fandom.This would have been so much better if it had been merely sold as a coming-of-age without the fandom aspect, but as a book that tries to sell fandom on me, it doesn't remotely work.I feel like this book represents online fandom in the way thatThe Big Bang Theoryrepresents math geeks and engineers. It caricaturizes and mocks fangirls/boys for the enjoyment of the reader, and not much more. It does nothing to dispel the myths of the laughable socially inept fanboy/fangirl, and that's just a damned shame.The first 20% of the book focused lightly on the fandom, and then the book kind of forgot about it with the exception of the \"Simon Snow\" excerpts, which were absolutely fucking pointless to the story as a whole.The summary brought in the tantalizing question \"Will Cath be able to leave Simon Snow behind?\" That's just it! By that point in the book, we had almost forgotten completely about Simon Snow and Cath's involvement within the fandom! The story was enjoyable, and I absolutely loved the dynamics of the relationships between the characters, but that's it. I felt like it wasn't an adequate representation of being a fangirl.Of course, if I'm going to complain about the representation of fangirls in the book, I should show some street cred. You name it, I've probably squee'd over it. Harry Potter. Anime. J-pop. K-pop. Computer games. Tabletop games. I have RPG-ed, I have MMO-ed, I have LARP-ed. From computer games like World of Warcraft, which took over 6 hours of my day while enrolled in a full college courseload (you don't know the meaning of fun until you've teamed up with 39 other people to take down a virtual monster while drunk), to rolling dice while pretending that I was a 8-year old crazy vampire child wielding a doll (I AIN'T EVEN SORRY).Anime conventions. Gaming conventions. I've done them all.I know what it's like to be a fangirl. I am proud of it. Even of moments like these.I was in Anime Club, which is a rough club formed around people into gaming/anime/Asian cultures. Needless to say, we had plenty of weabos and otakus and strange people in general. There were a whole lot of socially awkward people there, including me. We were dorks, yeah, we weren't entirely comfortable in company outside our immediate circle, but we knew how to adapt (it's called looking around and doing what everyone else is doing, not exactly fucking rocket science).None of us gamers/geeks/assorted idiots have ever been so socially incompetent as Cath.Social Ineptitude“I can’t help it,” Reagan said. “You’re really pathetic.”“I am not.”“You are. You don’t have any friends, your sister dumped you, you’re a freaky eater...And you’ve got some weird thing about Simon Snow.”If you looked upneurosesunder the Psychiatric DSM IV, you would find Cath's picture in the title page.This book does a disservice to fangirls in general by making Cath so incredibly, painfully socially incompetent. I would have liked this book better if it had remained a contemporary, instead,this book chooses to perpetuate the worst of beliefs about fangirls---which is to say, they're all fucking idiots who wouldn't know the word \"normal\" if it were summoned from a Patronus (god help you, my child, if you don't get that reference).Cath is drawn to be the person who wouldn't last 5 seconds alone in the wilderness, let alone a college campus. She is terrified of social interactions.She stocks up on food so she wouldn't have to face the terrifying, the monstrous, the ever-so-menacing...dining hall.Cath broke open a box of protein bars. She had four more boxes and three giant jars of peanut butter shoved under her bed. If she paced herself, she might not have to face the dining hall until October.Her life revolves around her twin (Wren) and the Simon Snow series. Cath is not an appealing character. Her hyper-clumsiness aside, she just has no fucking common sense. In an upper-level Fiction Writing class, she tries to pass off fanfiction as her own work. She then tries to submit it for a grade.“Our professor asked us to write a scene with an untrustworthy narrator. I wrote something about Simon and Baz...She didn’t get it. She thought it was plagiarism.” Cath forced herself to use that word, felt the tar wake up with a twist in her stomach.Fucking brilliant.Cath is sort of a Mary Sue. She goes off on a writing partner for writing a Mary Sue in his story, but if you think about it, Cath sort of is one herself. She's so brilliant that she gets into an upper-div writing class with a famous professor, and we never really see what kind of talent she has besides writing fanfiction. She is so good that an upperclassman wants to be her partner for it. Cath does nothing exemplary, and she's incredibly fucking weird, and regardless, a cute, a funny, a really awesome guy just wants her.She doesn't think of herself as beautiful, butidentical sisteris referred to as \"hot.\" HMMMMMMMMM.What Fandom?!From what we hear, Cath spent all her time writing Simon Snow fanfiction and going to premieres and chatting with her twin about Simon Snow...but that was in high school. No more of that.In fact,if you wanted to hear and learn about fandom, you'd be better off stopping at around 20% of the book. Because that's pretty much where life interferes.Except for a few brief moments of Cath reading and telling people about her fanfiction writing and about her love of fanfiction---we almost never hear about the \"fangirl\" aspect of the book again.This would have---and in fact, is, a completely solid book on dealing with family and friends and growing up. It's just NOT A BOOK ABOUT FANDOM BECAUSE THE FANDOM IS SOLIDLY RELEGATED TO THE BACKSEAT. YOU COULD GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FANDOM ON WIKIPEDIA.Where are all the forum discussions?Where are all the interactions with fellow fans?Where's the Tumblr?Where's the talking to fellow friends online for hours and hours on end because you're both fangirling so much that words are spilling over and you are just so happy to find a fellow fan?Where is the daydreaming?Where is the magic?What little of the fandom that existed in this book was restricted to Cath. Cath. Cath. The Great Cath.Where is the fucking COMMUNITY?The greatest part about any fandom is the community.We're all on Goodreads here, we love the books, but almost as importantly, we love interacting with one another, we love knowing that somewhere out there, there are people who understand us.This book doesn't represent that at all. It is solidly about Cath and her legions of fans. her 20,000 hits per fanfiction.net clone. Her full-of-it based on that fact. The fact that she, herself, has fans.Cath tried not to let it all go to her head. These characters belong to Gemma T. Leslie, she wrote at the beginning of every new chapter.This book is about a girl who is full of herself.The Writing:It tries too hard to be quirky.It works, at times, but some moments, and some sentences just made me wince.His eyes were set so deep, it made everything he said more intense.YOU DON'T SAY!His mouth was small, but bowed. Like a doll’s. She wondered if he had trouble opening it wide enough to eat apples.What the fuck?!He was wearing a thick, navy blue turtleneck sweater that made him look like he was serving on a Soviet battleship.Seriously?!She heard the very beginning of a smile in his voice—a fetal smile—and it very nearly killed her.I'd understand \"fatal\" smile, but \"fetal?\"Inside, her internal organs were grinding themselves into nervous pulp. Her intestines were gone. Her kidneys were disintegrating. Her stomach was wringing itself out, yanking on her trachea.BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARFThe Good: I fucking loved the relationships between the characters in the book. Wren and Cath. Their father and the twins. Reagan and Cath. Levi and Cath. The relationships were wonderfully, beautifully written, honest and realistic. I love the love, anger, and resentment between Cath and Wren.“Are you the older or younger twin?”She shrugged. “It was a C-section. But Wren was bigger. She was stealing my juice or something. I had to stay in the hospital for three weeks after she went home.”Cath didn’t tell him that sometimes she felt like Wren was still taking more than her fair share of life, like she was siphoning vitality off Cath—or like she was born with a bigger supply.I adored their awesome, manic father. He is the sweetest, cutest dad. This may sound gross, but I kind of have a dad-crush on him.“Cath? It’s your dad again. It’s still late, but I couldn’t wait to tell you this. You know how you guys want a bathroom upstairs? Your room is right over the bathroom. We could put in a trapdoor. And a ladder. It would be like a secret shortcut to the bathroom. Isn’t this a great idea? Call me. It’s your dad.”Reagan and Cath's relationship was the most unexpected, and the sweetest. I love the rough-around-the-edges Reagan. I loved her strength, I love her take-no-prisoners approach when it comes to pulling Cath out of her hermitage, and I love Reagan's unexpected moments of vulnerability.“No,” Reagan said, “we’ve got to get this out of the way. You can’t be jealous. And in return, I won’t flex my best-friend muscles just to remind myself that he loved me first.”“Oh my God”—Cath clutched her comforter in disbelief—“would you actually do that?”“I might,” Reagan said, leaning forward, her face as shocked as Cath’s. “In a moment of weakness. You’ve got to understand, I’ve been [his] favorite girl practically my whole life.\"Overall: a solid book if you are willing to read it for what it actually is: a contemporary coming of age.This is not a book that accurately represents fandom., error: Actual rating: 2.5Levi said. “It’s hard for me to get my head around. It’s like hearing that Harry Potter is gay.\"Ok, why the fuck are you referencing Harry Potter after having based the entire book around a fictionalized version of Harry Potter known as Simon Snow? Why?!If you wanted a true sense of fandom, don't look for it here.Don't get me wrong,I liked this book, but it is a coming-of-age book that was misrepresented as a book about fandom.This would have been so much better if it had been merely sold as a coming-of-age without the fandom aspect, but as a book that tries to sell fandom on me, it doesn't remotely work.I feel like this book represents online fandom in the way thatThe Big Bang Theoryrepresents math geeks and engineers. It caricaturizes and mocks fangirls/boys for the enjoyment of the reader, and not much more. It does nothing to dispel the myths of the laughable socially inept fanboy/fangirl, and that's just a damned shame.The first 20% of the book focused lightly on the fandom, and then the book kind of forgot about it with the exception of the \"Simon Snow\" excerpts, which were absolutely fucking pointless to the story as a whole.The summary brought in the tantalizing question \"Will Cath be able to leave Simon Snow behind?\" That's just it! By that point in the book, we had almost forgotten completely about Simon Snow and Cath's involvement within the fandom! The story was enjoyable, and I absolutely loved the dynamics of the relationships between the characters, but that's it. I felt like it wasn't an adequate representation of being a fangirl.Of course, if I'm going to complain about the representation of fangirls in the book, I should show some street cred. You name it, I've probably squee'd over it. Harry Potter. Anime. J-pop. K-pop. Computer games. Tabletop games. I have RPG-ed, I have MMO-ed, I have LARP-ed. From computer games like World of Warcraft, which took over 6 hours of my day while enrolled in a full college courseload (you don't know the meaning of fun until you've teamed up with 39 other people to take down a virtual monster while drunk), to rolling dice while pretending that I was a 8-year old crazy vampire child wielding a doll (I AIN'T EVEN SORRY).Anime conventions. Gaming conventions. I've done them all.I know what it's like to be a fangirl. I am proud of it. Even of moments like these.I was in Anime Club, which is a rough club formed around people into gaming/anime/Asian cultures. Needless to say, we had plenty of weabos and otakus and strange people in general. There were a whole lot of socially awkward people there, including me. We were dorks, yeah, we weren't entirely comfortable in company outside our immediate circle, but we knew how to adapt (it's called looking around and doing what everyone else is doing, not exactly fucking rocket science).None of us gamers/geeks/assorted idiots have ever been so socially incompetent as Cath.Social Ineptitude“I can’t help it,” Reagan said. “You’re really pathetic.”“I am not.”“You are. You don’t have any friends, your sister dumped you, you’re a freaky eater...And you’ve got some weird thing about Simon Snow.”If you looked upneurosesunder the Psychiatric DSM IV, you would find Cath's picture in the title page.This book does a disservice to fangirls in general by making Cath so incredibly, painfully socially incompetent. I would have liked this book better if it had remained a contemporary, instead,this book chooses to perpetuate the worst of beliefs about fangirls---which is to say, they're all fucking idiots who wouldn't know the word \"normal\" if it were summoned from a Patronus (god help you, my child, if you don't get that reference).Cath is drawn to be the person who wouldn't last 5 seconds alone in the wilderness, let alone a college campus. She is terrified of social interactions.She stocks up on food so she wouldn't have to face the terrifying, the monstrous, the ever-so-menacing...dining hall.Cath broke open a box of protein bars. She had four more boxes and three giant jars of peanut butter shoved under her bed. If she paced herself, she might not have to face the dining hall until October.Her life revolves around her twin (Wren) and the Simon Snow series. Cath is not an appealing character. Her hyper-clumsiness aside, she just has no fucking common sense. In an upper-level Fiction Writing class, she tries to pass off fanfiction as her own work. She then tries to submit it for a grade.“Our professor asked us to write a scene with an untrustworthy narrator. I wrote something about Simon and Baz...She didn’t get it. She thought it was plagiarism.” Cath forced herself to use that word, felt the tar wake up with a twist in her stomach.Fucking brilliant.Cath is sort of a Mary Sue. She goes off on a writing partner for writing a Mary Sue in his story, but if you think about it, Cath sort of is one herself. She's so brilliant that she gets into an upper-div writing class with a famous professor, and we never really see what kind of talent she has besides writing fanfiction. She is so good that an upperclassman wants to be her partner for it. Cath does nothing exemplary, and she's incredibly fucking weird, and regardless, a cute, a funny, a really awesome guy just wants her.She doesn't think of herself as beautiful, butidentical sisteris referred to as \"hot.\" HMMMMMMMMM.What Fandom?!From what we hear, Cath spent all her time writing Simon Snow fanfiction and going to premieres and chatting with her twin about Simon Snow...but that was in high school. No more of that.In fact,if you wanted to hear and learn about fandom, you'd be better off stopping at around 20% of the book. Because that's pretty much where life interferes.Except for a few brief moments of Cath reading and telling people about her fanfiction writing and about her love of fanfiction---we almost never hear about the \"fangirl\" aspect of the book again.This would have---and in fact, is, a completely solid book on dealing with family and friends and growing up. It's just NOT A BOOK ABOUT FANDOM BECAUSE THE FANDOM IS SOLIDLY RELEGATED TO THE BACKSEAT. YOU COULD GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FANDOM ON WIKIPEDIA.Where are all the forum discussions?Where are all the interactions with fellow fans?Where's the Tumblr?Where's the talking to fellow friends online for hours and hours on end because you're both fangirling so much that words are spilling over and you are just so happy to find a fellow fan?Where is the daydreaming?Where is the magic?What little of the fandom that existed in this book was restricted to Cath. Cath. Cath. The Great Cath.Where is the fucking COMMUNITY?The greatest part about any fandom is the community.We're all on Goodreads here, we love the books, but almost as importantly, we love interacting with one another, we love knowing that somewhere out there, there are people who understand us.This book doesn't represent that at all. It is solidly about Cath and her legions of fans. her 20,000 hits per fanfiction.net clone. Her full-of-it based on that fact. The fact that she, herself, has fans.Cath tried not to let it all go to her head. These characters belong to Gemma T. Leslie, she wrote at the beginning of every new chapter.This book is about a girl who is full of herself.The Writing:It tries too hard to be quirky.It works, at times, but some moments, and some sentences just made me wince.His eyes were set so deep, it made everything he said more intense.YOU DON'T SAY!His mouth was small, but bowed. Like a doll’s. She wondered if he had trouble opening it wide enough to eat apples.What the fuck?!He was wearing a thick, navy blue turtleneck sweater that made him look like he was serving on a Soviet battleship.Seriously?!She heard the very beginning of a smile in his voice—a fetal smile—and it very nearly killed her.I'd understand \"fatal\" smile, but \"fetal?\"Inside, her internal organs were grinding themselves into nervous pulp. Her intestines were gone. Her kidneys were disintegrating. Her stomach was wringing itself out, yanking on her trachea.BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARFThe Good: I fucking loved the relationships between the characters in the book. Wren and Cath. Their father and the twins. Reagan and Cath. Levi and Cath. The relationships were wonderfully, beautifully written, honest and realistic. I love the love, anger, and resentment between Cath and Wren.“Are you the older or younger twin?”She shrugged. “It was a C-section. But Wren was bigger. She was stealing my juice or something. I had to stay in the hospital for three weeks after she went home.”Cath didn’t tell him that sometimes she felt like Wren was still taking more than her fair share of life, like she was siphoning vitality off Cath—or like she was born with a bigger supply.I adored their awesome, manic father. He is the sweetest, cutest dad. This may sound gross, but I kind of have a dad-crush on him.“Cath? It’s your dad again. It’s still late, but I couldn’t wait to tell you this. You know how you guys want a bathroom upstairs? Your room is right over the bathroom. We could put in a trapdoor. And a ladder. It would be like a secret shortcut to the bathroom. Isn’t this a great idea? Call me. It’s your dad.”Reagan and Cath's relationship was the most unexpected, and the sweetest. I love the rough-around-the-edges Reagan. I loved her strength, I love her take-no-prisoners approach when it comes to pulling Cath out of her hermitage, and I love Reagan's unexpected moments of vulnerability.“No,” Reagan said, “we’ve got to get this out of the way. You can’t be jealous. And in return, I won’t flex my best-friend muscles just to remind myself that he loved me first.”“Oh my God”—Cath clutched her comforter in disbelief—“would you actually do that?”“I might,” Reagan said, leaning forward, her face as shocked as Cath’s. “In a moment of weakness.

It's likethat time I cheerfully broke up with Cassandra Clare, though, admittedly, over different reasons. But this time it hurts. It wounds me to realize that I can't join in with all my friends, ride theRainbow iz Queenbandwagon, roll around in a meadow of flowers that magically whispers witty Rainbow Rowell quotes and feast at theFangirlbanquet. I know it may seem foolish to be disappointed. I mean, what can a person physically do? No book can be universally loved and I did give it the good old college try.Here's the thing:For all intents and purposes, I should have lovedFangirl.The strange thing about my reading experience withFangirlis that I actually deeply connected with all of the characters on a personal level. As a person who suffers from anxiety and has dealt with a father who was admitted to a mental hospital when I was a teen, I sympathized with Cath. I remembered those feelings of craving independence from my sibling as Wren did. I understand having an intense passion for a fandom and being at midnight parties, waiting for the next book in your favorite series. I even connected with Laura's inability to handle life as a mom. In a lot of ways, quite a few of the experiences these characters dealt with, I have dealt with. For that reason alone, I gave this book an extra star. Unfortunately, that was not enough for me.Rainbow Rowell lives and breathes characters. They are fluid, realistic (for the most part...Eleanor & Parkexcluded), memorable, flawed, and relatable. These aren't the type of characters that stay on the page. They shout, scream and jump out at you because Rowell is just that good. But it's also her flaw because that's all she writes, characters. In fact, many times it feels like her stories have neither a beginning or an ending, with the reader viewing a piece of a character's life through a small window of time. So I'm convinced that Rowell can't plot her way out of a brown paper bag.I know that might anger some of you, but hear me out.Fangirlis a very character-driven novel and doesn't actuallyhavea plot.Rowell's created these characters, placed them in situations and forced them to react to said situations. She's great at that. But where does the book go from there? Which direction are the characters moving? What are they moving towards? What's the goal of the novel? These are some questions I've asked myself through every one of her books. And I often feel like I'm floundering around in her prose like someone who's gone swimming in the ocean drunk. Everything around these characters is static. Only they move from point A to point B to further the story along. Because of this, if you don't happen to fall in love with the characters early on, the story doesn't work. Rainbow Rowell's characters ARE her stories.One thing positive that came out of reading all of Rowell's books is that, I've learned that I am not the character-driven sort of reader. I'm more of a reader that needs a strong plot to see me to the end of the book. I can deal with unlikable characters or characters that have issues if the plot can save the day. I have the patience of a fruit fly and if I'm expected to sit around reading about a character who is waiting for something to happen to them, then forget it. You've lost me as a reader.The second issue I had withFangirlwas Rowell, once again, tip-toeing around elephants in her stories. Her novels are so focused on her characters that she never addresses things that feel essential to the plot. WithFangirlis was the slash fic and how it relates to fandom. WithLandlineit was the magical phone. WithEleanor and Parkit was race and Park's self acceptance. It's the same formula for each of her books over and over again.Step 1: Develop characters for half the book!Step 2: Introduce something heavy to center my quirky characters around something.Step 3: End the book without tying up loose ends because they served my purpose and Honey Rainbow don't care.It's the most frustrating thing about her books! It's like she dances around the heavy stuff on purpose! There is almost always something that feels deliberately left out, basically anything that could remotely make the story more interesting. Which leads me to my third point...Fangirlis boring.While I could relate to Cath, she is the dullest person to read about ever. The only scenes that she showed life with was either with her dad or Levi when she suddenly had a personality and wanted to be witty. Those scenes were the best in the book and what kept me reading. But they were few and far between and I started to question why this book was over 400 pages. Not even the fan fiction or cute romance could save this book.And let's talk about this Simon and Baz fan fiction. Clearly it is a homage toHarry Potter, yet,Harry Potterhappens to exist in the same universe asSimon Snow? No, I don't buy that. That's a plotberg if I ever saw one. The fan fiction sections in the novel really didn't do much for me. This isn't because it wasn't good, but because it didn't have enough page time for me to attempt to connect with the Simon and Baz. I did feel like bashing my head in when Cath would read Levi the long sections of her fic, so I guess they did spawn some type of emotional reaction in me, albeit, not a positive one. Also, did Cath ever finish her fic? Rowell wrote so much about Simon and Baz and just completely left that open... AGAIN FRUSTRATING.Side note: I'm really curious to see how Rowell manages to writeCarry On, Cath's fan fiction ofSimon Snow,without people directly comparing it toHarry Potter. I mean, essentially it's Draco/Harry fic. But since monetizing fan fiction is now a thing, *cough* Cassandra Clare, E.L. James *cough* who am I to stop her?To conclude,Fangirlultimately let me down, but I'm not entirely disappointed that I read it. I learned something about myself as a reader and I did gain a few good laughs from the clever banter. I wouldn't call this a terrible book, and hey, it was better thanEleanor and Park.

There are multiple reasons for its success - but they are also the same reasons as to why I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would.Anthony Doerr'sAll The Light We Cannot Seefollows the parallel lives of two protagonists - Marie-Laure, a French girl and daughter of a master locksmith at the Natural History Museum in Paris; the other character is Werner Pfenning, a German boy growing up in the mining town of Zollverein. Their lives are drawn against the brewing conflict, which will soon engulf not only France and Germany, but most of the world - the second World War.Both Marie and Werner are sympathetic character for whom the reader can root for - the author has made sure of that. Marie-Laure goes literally blind in the first or second chapter, and spends the beginning of the book becoming used to her new condition (mostly the help of her father, who designs elaborate puzzles for her to solve). Werner grows up in an industrial town hit by the depression, amidst the rise of the brownshirts; his only real companion is his sister, Jutta, and his only solace the radio - which Werner knows how to operate and fix instinctively, and to which they both listen at night.The Nazis eventually come to power and invade France, forcing Marie-Laure and her father to flee to the northern coastal town of Saint-Malo, an ancient walled city which provides picturesque setting for much of the book. In Germany, Werner's skill with the radio catches the eye of a Nazi official who sends him to the breeding ground for Nazi youth, where he will be trained to become a member of the military and eventually sent to the front. At the same time, a much older Nazi official searches all over France for an almost mythical diamond all over France, and is dedicated to finding it.Doerr's chapters are short and readable, and often contain pleasant nuggets of prose which was obviously carefully thought-out. To maintain suspense, he switches both between perspectives and time periods: various parts of the book are set in different years, mostly non-chronologically, and are comprised of chapters alternating between different characters.The trouble with the book is that it's not very compelling, surprising, or illuminating. With Doerr's outline for the story - three characters, three different viewpoints - we know that their stories will eventually collide, but when they finally do it happens in a quick, unsatisfying way. Doerr's characters lack moral complexity which would make them properly engaging - Marie Laure spends most of the book in hiding, which is understandable, but which also stops her from being forced to make important moral and ethical choices regarding her own survival. Werner is even more troubling - while he is troubled by brutality he witnesses at the Nazi school, he seems resigned to it. Werner neither openly embraces Nazism, nor condemns it - he's indifferent to the whole experience and role he plays. It's as if Doerr never gave Werner the opportunity to grow up, choosing instead to preserve the young boy, fascinated by radio - which goes contrary to what boys and children in general experience in any war, which instantly strips them of their childhoods forever. The subplot featuring Von Rumpel, the old Nazi who searches for the mystical diamond seems to be attached to the rest of the book for no reason except to move the plot forward - there's no complexity to his character at all, and develops exactly as expected.This is a book which looks as if it was designed to be read by younger readers - it's colorful setting, short chapters, switching points of narration will satisfy those with short attention spans, who require their story to be told quickly, engagingly, and not too demanding. I think all swearwords used in the book can be counted on the fingers of one hand; its language is very mellow and mild on obscenities. For a novel set during World War 2, it is a surprisingly tame book - murder and death cannot be escaped, but is downplayed as much as possible.

Yes.Still I can't pretend Legend is a good book, I just can't.The following gif shows my feeling toward this book:Okay, I can handle teenagers being stupid and clueless about how the world works, but I can't handle 15 years old teenagers who are supposed to begeniusesto act like a pair of hopeless idiots for an entire book.I am not a huge fan of dystopian novels but I especially dislike authors coming up with dystopian worlds which make no sense at all with governments doing evil things and killing offchildrenfor no good reason other than to show off how evil and fucked up said government is.After finished reading the whole story, I read from the Acknowledgement at the back of the book that the author, Marie Lu started writing the story ofLegendwhen she was 14 years old. Ah, now I can understand why as a whole this book feels so very damn juvenile even for a Young Adult novel.I am so done with all this eye-rolling stupidity, I am not going to read any more book by Marie Lu.Should I make a list to note down all the problems we have to face when encountering this piece of works?(1)The main characters:Day:At the ripe old age of 15, this boy has survived alone on the streets for five long years and he is the most wanted criminal in the country.Oh, so in this futuristic America, you become the most wanted criminal not by being a terrorist, a bank robber with firearm, a hacker or a serial killer, but by stealing, pushing pranks at the government and 'making them look bad'.Give me a break.And I don't believe for a second that Day can be a super smart tough kid who had endured the hardship of surviving on the mean streets for five long years, his actions and choices have never showed me enough wit and wisdom for him to survive that long. Plus he never mentions anything about going hungry, having to beg for food and money, being beat up or running into street gang in his past experience, how realistic.June:A 15 years old star student of the military and also the one and only teen in the entire country to get a perfect 1500 score at her Trail when she was 10 years old. Not only June is supposed to be super smart, she also has as much emotion as a robot, who can stay perfectly calm and showing barely any grief when she was informed, out of the blue, her older brother is dead and his corpse is on display right in front of her.Okay, it's nice to have a YA heroine who doesn't cry and moan at the slightest of things, but how can a girl act so emotionless at the wake of her brother's death? And she is also cool when seeing a spy gets tortured half to death?Not to mention, these two super smart teenagers fail to see through the villains' wicked plan when I can see it coming from a mile away.(2)The world building:What world building? I only know the country is at war with another enemy country and every kid has to go through a Trail when they reach 10 years old and those who fail the Trail would be (secretly) sentenced to death; plus the existence of the good-old United States is hidden by the evil government, it's mentioned that there were a series of natural disasters in the past, these are more or less all the world building I've ever gotten.Curious why the evil government would waste all those healthy-but-not-smart-enough kids by NOT training them up to be soldiers or labors when said government is at war with another nation, which means they would have needed all the manpower they can get their hands on instead of killing healthy and able 10 years old.Not to mention, in this futuristic world, police can randomly beat children up for disobedience and they can take money and food from the poor people; but why would the citizens allow it? How does the government justify such things? How does said government remain in power when they are treating the poor people like dirt? Nothing is explained.(3) The messed up little details:Ah yes, in this futuristic world, they can't afford to put CCTVs around hospitals and police stations, but somehow they manage to have the freaking Internet.The point is, when Day breaks into a hospital, there is no CCTV to record his break-in, but by the end of the story, all of a suddenthere areCCTVs around for the bad guys to check upon? Why are CCTVs suddenly there? Just because the author said so?Not only that, after the soldiers shot an plague-infected woman, they never bother to pick up the body, they just leave the corpse by the doorstep, and no one cares about an infected corpse being left out in the open neither.Are these people for real? Are they Too Stupid To Live or something?I am shocked that none of them has ever thought about burning the infected woman's body, or even burning the entire house down!(4) Tell, not show and lazy writing:We are told Day and June are smart but their actions and choices have always showed me otherwise, we are told Day is supposed to be a cult hero among the poor citizens but the author never bothers to show me any affection toward Day from any of the citizen I had encountered in the book, no one seems to adore Day aside from Tess and Day's own family. I am told there's a war going on but I see no evidence of how the war may affect the daily life of the general public. I feel like the author is taking us all for fools.To me, Legend is one of the perfect examples of why authors should not be allowed to publish a dystopian novel before they pass some tests on science, sociology, psychology and history.Review for book 2:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..., error: Updated@24/01/2018: Strange, I looked back at a comment I'd make in 2015, and I think this comment sums up why I dislikeLegendseries.

            "Translation failed for: This story is racist as hell.Just in case you were wondering.I'd never been interested in this book or the movie. This wasn't at all my cup of tea when it came out; I was in the middle of my high school career and only reading classics or fantasy and some science fiction. Domestic fiction, especially Southern, was an anathema.I'm not sure why I had this on my Overdrive wish list. Maybe it showed up on its own? Or maybe I've just expanded my reading interests (now I'll read anything that isn't full of romance because: GROSS!) far enough that this fell into my net at some point. Whatever the case, I finally listened to this book that was all the rage for years during my more youthful times.And it's racist as hell.So probably it should be one star, right?Probably.But I can't honestly say I didn't enjoy large parts of this book.Actually, this was a weird read, sort of two versions that happened simultaneously. Putting the story in the context of 1987, it was pretty open-minded and possibly even progressive, at least for white people, specifically middle-class white women. Any non-white American readers at the time would have seen just how shittily this story treats its black characters.Still, it evokes that nostalgia for the years between World Wars, of gritty, bootstrap-pulling characters in a tiny town who get along just fine, where the sheriff is a member of the KKK but runs out another group of KKKers because the fine people of Whistlestop take care of their own, including their coloreds. Pie is served for a nickel, wife-abusers go missing and no one's interested in looking any deeper into their whereabouts, a band of hobos and prostitutes live down by a river (not in a van) but don't bother the townsfolk none. Kids die or lose body parts on the railroad tracks and it's sad but everyone comes out ok in the end because that's just how things were back then. There's a golden glow over the town and not just in Ninnie Threadgoode's rosy, sentimental memories.30 years later, the racism is blatant and loud, covered with that \"I'm not a racist\" veneer that bigoted white people, specifically middle-class white women, love to use. There's lots of \"I have black friends!\"...(so I've been given license to say shit and believe shit I want to say and believe even though I know it's shit) going on. It's cringeworthy and it sucked. And it's sappy, overly nostalgic for something that has never actually existed.But then there's this strong current of feminism running throughout the book. Not third wave feminism, but that coming-out-of-the-dark ages feminism that just seemed to have occurred naturally after the 60's, a sort of after-shock from the first wave. Also, there's a lesbian couple that isn't presented as \"OMG, look how forward this book is by featuring a lesbian couple!\" but, rather, is just another couple among many in the story. I think that, more than anything, shocked me because I don't remember 1987 being a terribly inclusive time for gay folk. Hell, contemporary media still can't treat a lesbian couple as just another couple.I'm sure this book was hotly contested in churchy circles but Flagg introduced Ninnie Threadgoode, octogenarian and devout Christian who loves Oral Roberts but doesn't like Tammy Faye, as an even-minded (racist as hell) moderate conservative, white, former-housewife who is now in a nursing home. How was she received? I don't know because I didn't care about this book when it came out but I think if this were the big blockbuster novel of the summer now, there'd be plenty of bitching about its portrayal of moral decline on Facebook despite the Ninnie avatar.Actually, Ninnie's stories of old Whistlestop reminded me so much of the stories inBig Fish, seemingly tall tales that have been gilded with the patina of remembered better times that were never actually any better at all. There was a strong sense of \"Even though things were hard, people and life were more wholesome back then\" throughout the story; sentimentality at its finest. But that sort of narrative is appealing on several levels; it's nice to think there was a better time, even if we know there really wasn't.I did appreciate the still-relevant topics of aging and the fear of not being young anymore, of first friendships and first endings, of finding oneself, of dying towns and forgotten people. I was also amused that Sipsey's recipes are my family's recipes, I grew up with that cooking. Is it Southern or is that just how people across the nation cooked? I don't know, I just know that that's how I make chicken and dumplings, too.All in all, this is a story well-told with strong characters and an interesting, meandering plot but it really is racist as hell., error: Ta historia jest rasistowska jak cholera. Na wypadek, gdybyście się zastanawiali. Nigdy nie interesowała mnie ta książka ani film. To w ogóle nie było w moim guście, kiedy się ukazało; byłem w trakcie mojej kariery w szkole średniej i czytałem tylko klasykę lub fantasy i trochę science fiction. Fikcja krajowa, zwłaszcza południowa, była przekleństwem. Nie jestem pewien, dlaczego umieściłem to na mojej liście życzeń Overdrive. Może pojawiło się samo? Albo może po prostu rozszerzyłem swoje zainteresowania czytelnicze (teraz przeczytam wszystko, co nie jest pełne romansu, ponieważ: OBRZYDLIWE!) na tyle, że w pewnym momencie to wpadło mi w oko. Tak czy inaczej, w końcu posłuchałem tej książki, która była wściekła przez lata, gdy byłem młodszy. I jest rasistowska jak cholera. Więc prawdopodobnie powinna dostać jedną gwiazdkę, prawda? Prawdopodobnie. Ale nie mogę szczerze powiedzieć, że nie podobały mi się duże fragmenty tej książki. Właściwie to była dziwna lektura, jakby dwie wersje, które wydarzyły się jednocześnie. Umieszczając historię w kontekście 1987 roku, była ona dość otwarta, a może nawet postępowa, przynajmniej dla białych ludzi, szczególnie białych kobiet z klasy średniej. Każdy niebiały amerykański czytelnik w tamtym czasie zobaczyłby, jak chujowo ta historia traktuje swoich czarnych bohaterów. Mimo to przywołuje nostalgię za latami międzywojennymi, za surowymi, chodzącymi za sznurowadłami bohaterami w małym miasteczku, którzy dobrze się dogadują, gdzie szeryf jest członkiem Ku Klux Klanu, ale wypędza inną grupę członków Ku Klux Klanu, ponieważ porządni ludzie z Whistlestop dbają o swoich, w tym o kolorowych. Ciasto jest serwowane za pięć centów, znikają mężczyźni stosujący przemoc wobec żon i nikt nie jest zainteresowany głębszym zbadaniem ich miejsca pobytu, grupa włóczęgów i prostytutek mieszka nad rzeką (nie w furgonetce), ale nie przeszkadza mieszkańcom miasta. Dzieci umierają lub tracą części ciała na torach kolejowych i jest to smutne, ale wszyscy wychodzą z tego cało, ponieważ tak po prostu było w tamtych czasach. Nad miastem unosi się złota poświata, i to nie tylko w różowych, sentymentalnych wspomnieniach Ninnie Threadgoode. 30 lat później rasizm jest jaskrawy i głośny, przykryty tym „nie jestem rasistką”, którego bigoterzy, zwłaszcza białe kobiety z klasy średniej, uwielbiają używać. Jest mnóstwo „mam czarnych przyjaciół!”... (więc dostałem pozwolenie na mówienie gówna i wierzenie w gówno, które chcę mówić i w które chcę wierzyć, mimo że wiem, że to gówno). To żenujące i do bani. I jest to ckliwe, przesadnie nostalgiczne za czymś, co nigdy tak naprawdę nie istniało. Ale potem jest ten silny nurt feminizmu przewijający się przez całą książkę. Nie feminizm trzeciej fali, ale ten feminizm wychodzący z mroków wieków, który po prostu wydawał się pojawić naturalnie po latach 60., rodzaj wstrząsu po pierwszej fali. Poza tym jest para lesbijek, która nie jest przedstawiona jako „OMG, zobacz, jak bardzo ta książka jest nowoczesna, przedstawiając parę lesbijek!”, ale raczej jest po prostu kolejną parą wśród wielu w historii. Myślę, że to, bardziej niż cokolwiek innego, mnie zszokowało, ponieważ nie pamiętam, aby 1987 był strasznie inkluzywnym czasem dla osób homoseksualnych. Cholera, współczesne media nadal nie mogą traktować pary lesbijek jako po prostu kolejnej pary. Jestem pewien, że ta książka była gorąco kwestionowana w kręgach kościelnych, ale Flagg przedstawiła Ninnie Threadgoode, osiemdziesięcioletnią i pobożną chrześcijankę, która kocha Oral Roberts, ale nie lubi Tammy Faye, jako zrównoważoną (rasistowską jak cholera) umiarkowaną konserwatystkę, białą, byłą gospodynię domową, która teraz jest w domu opieki. Jak została przyjęta? Nie wiem, bo nie obchodziła mnie ta książka, kiedy się ukazała, ale myślę, że gdyby była teraz wielkim przebojem tego lata, byłoby mnóstwo narzekań na jej przedstawienie upadku moralnego na Facebooku, pomimo awatara Ninnie. Właściwie opowieści Ninnie o starym Whistlestopie tak bardzo przypominały mi historie z Dużej Ryby, pozornie niestworzone historie, które zostały pozłocone patyną zapamiętanych lepszych czasów, które tak naprawdę nigdy nie były lepsze. W całej historii było silne poczucie „Chociaż było ciężko, ludzie i życie były wtedy bardziej zdrowe”; sentymentalizm w najlepszym wydaniu. Ale tego rodzaju narracja jest atrakcyjna na kilku poziomach; miło jest myśleć, że były lepsze czasy, nawet jeśli wiemy, że tak naprawdę ich nie było. Doceniłem wciąż aktualne tematy starzenia się i strachu przed tym, że nie jest się już młodym, pierwszych przyjaźni i pierwszych zakończeń, odnajdywania siebie, umierających miast i zapomnianych ludzi. Bawiło mnie też to, że przepisy Sipsey'ego to przepisy mojej rodziny, dorastałem z takim gotowaniem. Czy to południowe, czy po prostu tak gotują ludzie w całym kraju? Nie wiem, wiem tylko, że ja też tak robię kurczaka i pierogi. Podsumowując, jest to dobrze opowiedziana historia z silnymi postaciami i ciekawą, krętą fabułą, ale naprawdę jest rasistowska jak cholera. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: The act of writing is strangely powerful, almost magical: to take ideas and put them into a lasting, physical form that can persist outside of the mind. For a culture without a written tradition, a libraries are not great structures of stone full of objects--instead, stories are curated within flesh, locked up in a cage of bone. To know the story, you must go to the storyteller. In order for that story to persist through time, it must be retold and rememorized by successive generations.A book, scroll, or tablet, on the other hand, can be rediscovered thousands of years later, after all those who were familiar with the story are long dead--and miraculously, the stories within it can be delivered to modern man in the very same words the ancients used. If, in Qumran cave, we had found the dry bones of the scribe who copied the dead sea scrolls instead of the scrolls themselves, we would have no access to any of his knowledge.Any library can be destroyed, whether the tales are stored in the mind of a bard or on the skins of animals, but unwritten history is much more fragile--after all, speech is nothing more than wind, which cannot be dug up from the earth a century later. All lands have their own histories, but sadly, we only get to hear a scant few in their own words.We know that Africa had empires as complex and powerful as those of Europe--beyond the well-known examples of Egypt and Carthage, the Romans give us secondary evidence of the great Central African empires from which they got their salt and gold, alongside many subsequent references--but in the end, these amount to little more than myths and legends.Carthage itself was so thoroughly destroyed that Rome basically erased their true history, replacing it with Roman propaganda and rumor-mongering, until inThe Aeneid, Carthage becomes nothing more than Rome’s jealous, jilted lover--instead of what she truly was: the template of naval dominance and mercantile power that Rome copied and built her empire upon.The African continent is just as full of ruins and archaeological treasures as Europe or Asia, but due to rampant social and economic instability caused by multinationals squabbling over resources and profits in the power vacuum left in the wake of post-colonialism, it’s not currently safe or supportable to research these sites and rediscover the cultures they represent. Hopefully someday, we will be able to uncover this wealth of knowledge, but until then, we can only imagine all that we have missed: the great loves and wars of Africa, the dark-skinned Caesars and Helens, the Subotais and Musashis of the savanna.But not all is lost to us. We still have pieces of the puzzle: the fact that fractal math, on which we base our computer languages,comes from North African divination(which is why Fibonacci had to go there to learn it), or the fact that most of the Greek and Roman texts upon which the Western literary tradition is basedwere passed down to usnot from Christian monks, but Islamic scholars (this is why Averroes appears in Raphael'sSchool of Athens, and whyhe and Avicenna appearalongside Plato and Aristotle in the works of Dante). The glory ofBenin City, the wealth ofMansa Musa--all these await the student of African histories.Plus, there are still storytellers in Africa--the lineages through which their histories have passed are not all dead. Though the words were not written down, we can research them, all the same--looking for lost ‘texts’, rare tales, and compiling them, collecting them, and finally giving voice to histories that have been too-long obscured. Knowing all of this, I thirsted for depth and complexity from Achebe--to get a view into one of the innumerable cultures of Africa.The power of a story from a different culture is in defamiliarization. Though all cultures share certain universal ideas: love, freedom, revenge, tyranny--the way they are expressed in each particular culture can be eye opening. So, they are capable of showing us familiar things, but making them feel new, making us look at them in a fresh way.Yet, that's not what I got from this book--indeed, everything in it felt immediately recognizable and familiar, not merely in the sense of 'universal human experience', but in almost every detail of expression and structure. I have read modern stories by fellow American authors which were stranger and produced more culture shock, more defamiliarization than this--but perhaps that was Achebe's intention.He expressed in interviews just how difficult it was for an African author to publish a novel at all--that no one assumed an African would want to write their own story, andthe manuscript was almost lostbecause the typing agency just didn't take it seriously. Back then, the very notion that Africa might have a history outside of Egypt was controversial--even though it seems simple and obvious to us now that of course every people in every nation has their own history, and the desire for their unique voices to be heard.So, perhaps it would have been impossible to write a more complex book, that it just wouldn't have been received--Achebe was among the first generation of his people to be college educated, in a branch of a London University opened in Nigeria taught by White, English teachers. More than that, he may have been trying to show that his own culture was just like the culture of his teachers--to stress the similarities instead of the differences.So then, it makes sense that Achebe is not writing a primer of his culture, but is rather reflecting European culture back at itself, from the mouth of an Igbo man (a brave and revolutionary act!). After all, he was the consummate Western man of letters, by his education, and everything about his book's form reflects that. It is written, not oral, it is in English, it aligns neatly to the Greek tragic structure and the form of the novel--and even the title is taken fromone of the most famous poemsin the English language.Achebe is hardly being coy with his inspirations here--he wants us to know that he is adopting Western forms, he wants us to recognize them, to mark them. He is aware that this is a post-colonial work, a work from a culture that has already been colonized, and is responding to that colonization. This is not a voice from the past--the discovery of Gilgamesh buried in the sands--it is a modern voice speaking from the center of the storm.The central theme is the onset of colonization, the conflict between the tribe and the European forces just beginning to encroach upon them. Likehis most notable lecture, this book is a deliberate response to writers like Conrad, Kipling, and Haggard.I'm not trying to suggest that it's a problem that Achebe is writing in the Western style, or that he's somehow 'too Western'--because it's any author's prerogative if they want to study and explore Western themes. Indeed, asSaid observed, it's vital that writers reach across these boundaries, that we don't just force them into a niche where 'women writers write the female experience' and 'Asian writers write the Asian experience'--because that's just racial determinism: due to the culture you're born in, you can only every write one thing (unless you're a White man, and then you can write whatever you like).Indeed, one cannot confront colonialism without understanding it, adopting its forms, and turning them against the power structure. Achebe himself recognized that an oppressed individual has to use every tool to his advantage to fight back--even those tools brought in by the oppressors, such as the English language, which Achebe realized would allow him to communicate with colonized peoples from countries around the world. Authors from all sorts of national and cultural background have taken on the Western style in this way, and proven that they can write just as ably as any Westerner. Unfortunately, that's not the case with this book.As a traditionally Western tale, there just isn't a lot to it. It is a tale of personal disintegration representing the loss of culture, and of purpose. It is an existential mode seen in Arthur Miller, Joseph Heller, and J.D. Salinger--but by trying to make the story more universal, Achebe has watered it down too much, so that it lacks depth, sympathy, and possibility. His existentialism is remarkable for its completeness. There is no character who is wholly sympathetic, nor wholly vile. There is no culture or point of view which is either elevated or vilified.Achebe is extremely fair, presenting the flaws of all men, and of the organizations under which they live, be they Western or African in origin. Like Heller or Miller, his representation of mankind is almost unfailingly negative. Small moments of beauty, joy, or innocence are always mitigated. They exist only in the inflated egos of the characters, or the moralizing ideals of the culture.Unlike Miller, he does not give us the chance to sympathize. There are not those quiet moments of introspection that makeDeath of a Salesmanso personally tragic. Unlike Heller, Achebe does not contrast the overwhelming weight of loss with sardonic and wry humor. This is not the hyperbole of Belinda's lock, nor the mad passion of Hamlet.Achebe's characters are not able to find their own meaning in hopelessness--nor do they even struggle to find it and fail, they cannot even laugh at themselves. They persist only through naivete and escapism, and since the reader sees through them, we see that this world has only despondence and delusion.The constant reminder of this disappointment makes the book difficult to connect with. Since all the hope we are given is almost immediately false, there is little dynamic possibility. Everything is already lost, we only wait on the characters to realize it.It is difficult to court the reader's sympathy when there is nothing left to be hopeful for. With no counterpoint to despondence--not even a false one--it is hard to create narrative depth, to reveal, or to surprise. Trying to write a climax through such a pervasive depression is like trying to raise a mountain in a valley.No matter how hard they try, there is no visible path to success. Nothing is certain, and the odds against are often overwhelming. Achebe felt this doubly, as an author and a colonized citizen. He succeeds in presenting hopelessness, sometimes reaching Sysiphean Absurdism, but with too few grains to weigh in the scale against it, his tale presents only a part of the human experience.Though we may know that others suffer, this is not the same as comprehending their suffering. The mother who says 'eat your peas, kids are starving in Africa' succeeds more through misdirection than by revealing the inequalities of politics and the human state.Achebe presents suffering to us, but it is not sympathetic; we see it, but are not invited to feel it. His world loses depth and dimension, becomes scattered, and while this does show us the way that things may fall apart, particularly all things human, this work is more an exercise in nihilism than a representation of the human experience.So, it ends up being one of those books that it more notable for its place in the canon than its quality. It was certainly a brave and revolutionary act for Achebe to write it, and to persist with it, but the book itself is less impressive than the gesture that produced it. For me, it becomes prototypical of a whole movement of books by people of non-Western descent who get praised and published precisely because they parrot back Western values at us and avoid confronting us with actual cultural differences, while at the same time using a thin patina of 'foreignness' to feel suitably exotic, so that the average Western reader can feel more worldly for having read them.It's flat works likeThe Kite RunnerorHouse Made of Dawnwhich are just exotic enough to titillate without actually requiring that the reader learn anything about the culture in order to appreciate it--because of course every guilt-ridden Liberal Westerner wants to read about other cultures, butas Stewart Lee put it:\"... not like that, Stew, not where you have to know anything ...\"In the most extreme cases you get something likeThe Education of Little Tree, where a racist KKK member pretends to be a Native American and writes a book so saccharine, so apologetic and appeasing of White guilt that it can't help but become a best-seller--because it turns out that no one is better at predicting what comforting things Middle America wants to hear about race than a member of the KKK.Of course, I'm not suggesting that Achebe is anywhere near that--just that it makes obvious the problem with judging a book by its historical place rather than the actual words on the page. Indeed, it's downright insulting to the author and the culture. It's the same response people would have to hearing that a dog wrote a book: 'Wow! I've got to read that!\"--which has nothing to do with the quality of the book, and everything to do with the fact that we have very low expectations of dogs.To treat a person the same way because they are from another culture is pure condescension. Just because someone is born into a culture, that does not make them representative of that culture--authenticity is not an in-born trait, which is the problem of the illusion of the 'pure voice', because there is no pure cultural voice, and to imagine there is is to reduce that culture to a stereotype.A woman can be a misogynist, an African American can hate his own people. To suggest that somehow, a person's views and perspective are in-born and unchangeable is simply racism--and it doesn't matter if the trait you are assigning to that race is positive or negative, it's still a limitation you're putting on that person.Non-Westerners are just as capable of creating great works of art as Westerners--but they are also just as capable of writing cliche tripe. Like any other human being, they run the gamut from brilliant to dull, from bigoted to open-minded, from staid to imaginative. As such, there's no reason to grade non-Western authors on some kind of sliding scale, to expect less from them, or to be any less disappointed when their works fall short. Of course, we shouldn't judge their work by Western standards, either--to blame a Japanese fairytale for not being Hamlet--unless like Achebe they are writing in a recognizable Western style and deliberately drawing that comparison.While there's certainly something to be said for 'getting your foot in the door', that isn't a defense of the book itself--of its plot, characters, or themes. It's also too much to place Africa on Achebe's shoulders--to pretend as if there aren't thousands of unique cultures, histories, and traditions there--and yet that is what we do. We make Achebe into a point of entry to a whole continent, which is a massive burden to place on anyone. Much better to look at the book itself--its words and images--than to try to make it into something that it is not.A book that lasts can't just be its place and time, it needs to have a deeper vein that successive generations can return to over and over, and I didn't find that here. Indeed, I find it ironic that Achebe has so attacked Conrad, because like Achebe’s work,Heart of Darknessis remarkable because it does take a stand against colonialism and racism. It is admittedly an early stand, and an incomplete presentation, just like Achebe’s. It works only because it is situated in that certain way, transgressive but nottoo transgressiveto alienate its audience--not quite able to escape being a product of its time, but still managing to point the way to the future.But Conrad is not merely revolutionary by his stance, he has also written a fascinating and fraught book, complex and many-layered, which succeeds despite its shortfalls.Things Fall Apart, in contrast, is a book that only works because of its positioning, and has little further depth to recommend it. I cannot say that the book was not effective, in its place and time--because it certainly was--or that it hasn't been inspirational, but in the end, Achebe's revolutionary gesture far outshines the meager story beneath it., error: The act of writing is strangely powerful, almost magical: to take ideas and put them into a lasting, physical form that can persist outside of the mind. For a culture without a written tradition, a libraries are not great structures of stone full of objects--instead, stories are curated within flesh, locked up in a cage of bone. To know the story, you must go to the storyteller. In order for that story to persist through time, it must be retold and rememorized by successive generations.A book, scroll, or tablet, on the other hand, can be rediscovered thousands of years later, after all those who were familiar with the story are long dead--and miraculously, the stories within it can be delivered to modern man in the very same words the ancients used. If, in Qumran cave, we had found the dry bones of the scribe who copied the dead sea scrolls instead of the scrolls themselves, we would have no access to any of his knowledge.Any library can be destroyed, whether the tales are stored in the mind of a bard or on the skins of animals, but unwritten history is much more fragile--after all, speech is nothing more than wind, which cannot be dug up from the earth a century later. All lands have their own histories, but sadly, we only get to hear a scant few in their own words.We know that Africa had empires as complex and powerful as those of Europe--beyond the well-known examples of Egypt and Carthage, the Romans give us secondary evidence of the great Central African empires from which they got their salt and gold, alongside many subsequent references--but in the end, these amount to little more than myths and legends.Carthage itself was so thoroughly destroyed that Rome basically erased their true history, replacing it with Roman propaganda and rumor-mongering, until inThe Aeneid, Carthage becomes nothing more than Rome’s jealous, jilted lover--instead of what she truly was: the template of naval dominance and mercantile power that Rome copied and built her empire upon.The African continent is just as full of ruins and archaeological treasures as Europe or Asia, but due to rampant social and economic instability caused by multinationals squabbling over resources and profits in the power vacuum left in the wake of post-colonialism, it’s not currently safe or supportable to research these sites and rediscover the cultures they represent. Hopefully someday, we will be able to uncover this wealth of knowledge, but until then, we can only imagine all that we have missed: the great loves and wars of Africa, the dark-skinned Caesars and Helens, the Subotais and Musashis of the savanna.But not all is lost to us. We still have pieces of the puzzle: the fact that fractal math, on which we base our computer languages,comes from North African divination(which is why Fibonacci had to go there to learn it), or the fact that most of the Greek and Roman texts upon which the Western literary tradition is basedwere passed down to usnot from Christian monks, but Islamic scholars (this is why Averroes appears in Raphael'sSchool of Athens, and whyhe and Avicenna appearalongside Plato and Aristotle in the works of Dante). The glory ofBenin City, the wealth ofMansa Musa--all these await the student of African histories.Plus, there are still storytellers in Africa--the lineages through which their histories have passed are not all dead. Though the words were not written down, we can research them, all the same--looking for lost ‘texts’, rare tales, and compiling them, collecting them, and finally giving voice to histories that have been too-long obscured. Knowing all of this, I thirsted for depth and complexity from Achebe--to get a view into one of the innumerable cultures of Africa.The power of a story from a different culture is in defamiliarization. Though all cultures share certain universal ideas: love, freedom, revenge, tyranny--the way they are expressed in each particular culture can be eye opening. So, they are capable of showing us familiar things, but making them feel new, making us look at them in a fresh way.Yet, that's not what I got from this book--indeed, everything in it felt immediately recognizable and familiar, not merely in the sense of 'universal human experience', but in almost every detail of expression and structure. I have read modern stories by fellow American authors which were stranger and produced more culture shock, more defamiliarization than this--but perhaps that was Achebe's intention.He expressed in interviews just how difficult it was for an African author to publish a novel at all--that no one assumed an African would want to write their own story, andthe manuscript was almost lostbecause the typing agency just didn't take it seriously. Back then, the very notion that Africa might have a history outside of Egypt was controversial--even though it seems simple and obvious to us now that of course every people in every nation has their own history, and the desire for their unique voices to be heard.So, perhaps it would have been impossible to write a more complex book, that it just wouldn't have been received--Achebe was among the first generation of his people to be college educated, in a branch of a London University opened in Nigeria taught by White, English teachers. More than that, he may have been trying to show that his own culture was just like the culture of his teachers--to stress the similarities instead of the differences.So then, it makes sense that Achebe is not writing a primer of his culture, but is rather reflecting European culture back at itself, from the mouth of an Igbo man (a brave and revolutionary act!). After all, he was the consummate Western man of letters, by his education, and everything about his book's form reflects that. It is written, not oral, it is in English, it aligns neatly to the Greek tragic structure and the form of the novel--and even the title is taken fromone of the most famous poemsin the English language.Achebe is hardly being coy with his inspirations here--he wants us to know that he is adopting Western forms, he wants us to recognize them, to mark them. He is aware that this is a post-colonial work, a work from a culture that has already been colonized, and is responding to that colonization. This is not a voice from the past--the discovery of Gilgamesh buried in the sands--it is a modern voice speaking from the center of the storm.The central theme is the onset of colonization, the conflict between the tribe and the European forces just beginning to encroach upon them. Likehis most notable lecture, this book is a deliberate response to writers like Conrad, Kipling, and Haggard.I'm not trying to suggest that it's a problem that Achebe is writing in the Western style, or that he's somehow 'too Western'--because it's any author's prerogative if they want to study and explore Western themes. Indeed, asSaid observed, it's vital that writers reach across these boundaries, that we don't just force them into a niche where 'women writers write the female experience' and 'Asian writers write the Asian experience'--because that's just racial determinism: due to the culture you're born in, you can only every write one thing (unless you're a White man, and then you can write whatever you like).Indeed, one cannot confront colonialism without understanding it, adopting its forms, and turning them against the power structure. Achebe himself recognized that an oppressed individual has to use every tool to his advantage to fight back--even those tools brought in by the oppressors, such as the English language, which Achebe realized would allow him to communicate with colonized peoples from countries around the world. Authors from all sorts of national and cultural background have taken on the Western style in this way, and proven that they can write just as ably as any Westerner. Unfortunately, that's not the case with this book.As a traditionally Western tale, there just isn't a lot to it. It is a tale of personal disintegration representing the loss of culture, and of purpose. It is an existential mode seen in Arthur Miller, Joseph Heller, and J.D. Salinger--but by trying to make the story more universal, Achebe has watered it down too much, so that it lacks depth, sympathy, and possibility. His existentialism is remarkable for its completeness. There is no character who is wholly sympathetic, nor wholly vile. There is no culture or point of view which is either elevated or vilified.Achebe is extremely fair, presenting the flaws of all men, and of the organizations under which they live, be they Western or African in origin. Like Heller or Miller, his representation of mankind is almost unfailingly negative. Small moments of beauty, joy, or innocence are always mitigated. They exist only in the inflated egos of the characters, or the moralizing ideals of the culture.Unlike Miller, he does not give us the chance to sympathize. There are not those quiet moments of introspection that makeDeath of a Salesmanso personally tragic. Unlike Heller, Achebe does not contrast the overwhelming weight of loss with sardonic and wry humor. This is not the hyperbole of Belinda's lock, nor the mad passion of Hamlet.Achebe's characters are not able to find their own meaning in hopelessness--nor do they even struggle to find it and fail, they cannot even laugh at themselves. They persist only through naivete and escapism, and since the reader sees through them, we see that this world has only despondence and delusion.The constant reminder of this disappointment makes the book difficult to connect with. Since all the hope we are given is almost immediately false, there is little dynamic possibility. Everything is already lost, we only wait on the characters to realize it.It is difficult to court the reader's sympathy when there is nothing left to be hopeful for. With no counterpoint to despondence--not even a false one--it is hard to create narrative depth, to reveal, or to surprise. Trying to write a climax through such a pervasive depression is like trying to raise a mountain in a valley.No matter how hard they try, there is no visible path to success. Nothing is certain, and the odds against are often overwhelming. Achebe felt this doubly, as an author and a colonized citizen. He succeeds in presenting hopelessness, sometimes reaching Sysiphean Absurdism, but with too few grains to weigh in the scale against it, his tale presents only a part of the human experience.Though we may know that others suffer, this is not the same as comprehending their suffering. The mother who says 'eat your peas, kids are starving in Africa' succeeds more through misdirection than by revealing the inequalities of politics and the human state.Achebe presents suffering to us, but it is not sympathetic; we see it, but are not invited to feel it. His world loses depth and dimension, becomes scattered, and while this does show us the way that things may fall apart, particularly all things human, this work is more an exercise in nihilism than a representation of the human experience.So, it ends up being one of those books that it more notable for its place in the canon than its quality.

            "Translation failed for: Eh.Okay. There's political writing, and then there's political comics (Watchmen, also by Moore). Pure political writing, essays or editorials or what have you, doesn't have to leave everyone satisfied. It can leave some angry or displeased or challenged, so long as it makes its point.POLITICAL COMICS HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT.A political comic must not only make a clear political point, but it must ALSO be interesting in a way that is peculiar to comics: it must have a gratifying narrative, it must be artistically sound, and it must have the same kind of emotional influence that a regular old novel or movie would have, because comics are, primarily, STORIES.V for Vendettais a glut of political writing stuffed into an attractive skin of art and garnished over with the platitudiest delivery I have ever had the misfortune to be exposed to outside a 50s superhero comic. My god. It's got the same blind and senseless energy of delivery that any Superman-hurling-a-car comic would have. This stems, I think, primarily from the fact that it's an anarchist comic, and making anarchism into a coherent and attractive viewpoint is nearly impossible, given that anarchism is probably the illest-conceived of any extant ideology.However, because it's ANARCHISM, because the writing is coherent and cleverer than most graphic novels', because it's all draped over with mystery, because it's a well-designed book, tone and layout-wise, and because the art is fantastic, the essential failure of the book-- the fact that it lacks anything behind its shell of hyperenergetic blathering-- gets a pass.Seriously. The book tries so hard to be political and symbolic it crushes itself. Premise-wise, the story doesn't make a lot of sense-- we hear that England was living in a government vacuum for several years, and that London was straight-across flooded, and that every other landmass on the planet has been nuked, AND that a nuclear winter has occurred, but for some reason they're still living in a fully-mechanized modern consumer society. All right. Sure. Also, it appears that the only remaining political ideologies in the universe are Fascism and Socialism/Communism, with Anarchism resting on its own crazy-ass axis out who the hell knows where. All right, again. Beginning to sound more and more like Revolutionary Spain/every third world country ever. Sure. Got that. 'First and freest Republic in the world loses all sense of its political heritage and persecutes the hell out of its inhabitants' is the ONLY trend in British apocalyptic fiction, but this is the worst I've ever seen it done.I don't know. What is Moore posing here as the only options for political ideology? He paints a world in which one can ONLY be EITHER a ethnocentric homophobic racist fascist or an 'anarchist'. All right. What does he mean by this? Returning to a state of nature? Gradual and spontaneous shift to democracy? End of the modern mechanized world? Spontaneous national adoption of a sort of leaderless socialist state? Hmm. Moore handles his material childishly. For me, the political-apocalypse stories that WORK show the protagonists yearning after a state of leave-me-alone-let's-all-be-friends sort of political neutralism-- a state of 'let's have universal human rights and that's all please' joy. A utopia of 'being a normal person'. Children of Men is like this. EvenWatchmenis less heavy on the socialism and focuses more on the 'let's stop being persecutors and start being nice to everyone else again' mentality. Readers can therefore identify with the protagonists-- they aren't radicals. They're just normal people trying to be normal again. But in V for Vendetta, the only way peace can be achieved is if every individual person is a politically-radical crowd member willing to use mob violence.Not inspirational.I don't care what you think about the degree to which individuals must be political to preserve their rights. This book makes no coherent political point and the messages it DOES articulate are comprised solely of platitudes. It fails to rpesent any realistic view of any political spectrum whatsoever. Instead of focusing on human rights/the dignity of man/the right to be free, it sours the whole batch by presenting some shallowly-conceived idea of anarchism as the solution to all modern political crises. The fact is that this book reads like a poorly-contrived piece of anti-Thatcher propaganda.Which is essentially what it is.EDIT: I've read some other reviews of this book on goodreads and I've decided I have to make one point.You CANNOT like this book becuase 'V is an amazing character.' V IS ALMOST NOT A CHARACTER. Moore specifically has him talk about how who he is is not important. V is a big bundle of soggy political ideology stuffed up into a man-suit with a funny mask on the front. The whole backstory bit exists to give the situation-- the SITUATION, not the character-- plausibility. The fact that the backstory even exists sours Moore's ideological point, which is unfortunate, since the point was shallow enough to begin with. V is suppsoed to be an 'everyman', and is supposed to represent the potential in all of us to make a difference. But how did he get like this? First of all, he's insane, mildly or seriously, but slightly insane at some level, at any rate. Secondly, he's got SUPER POWERS of combat/the mind that he was given in a crazy SCIENCE-FICTION HORMONE EXPERIMENT. All right. So the potential to make a difference is there in all of us, but we need a hero to tell us this is so, and that hero himself needs to be a super-human person in some way before he can take up the job? I don't think so.There's some extreme cognitive dissonance in this story. Moore can't decide whether to espouse the power of the people as a body or the power of the individual-- an individual who, in some ways, is nearly as charismatic as a 20th-century dictator, yet who is, in other ways, utterly flat and irrelevant.V is not a character. V is an idea, and a cloudy one at that., error: Eh.Okay. There's political writing, and then there's political comics (Watchmen, also by Moore). Pure political writing, essays or editorials or what have you, doesn't have to leave everyone satisfied. It can leave some angry or displeased or challenged, so long as it makes its point.POLITICAL COMICS HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT.A political comic must not only make a clear political point, but it must ALSO be interesting in a way that is peculiar to comics: it must have a gratifying narrative, it must be artistically sound, and it must have the same kind of emotional influence that a regular old novel or movie would have, because comics are, primarily, STORIES.V for Vendettais a glut of political writing stuffed into an attractive skin of art and garnished over with the platitudiest delivery I have ever had the misfortune to be exposed to outside a 50s superhero comic. My god. It's got the same blind and senseless energy of delivery that any Superman-hurling-a-car comic would have. This stems, I think, primarily from the fact that it's an anarchist comic, and making anarchism into a coherent and attractive viewpoint is nearly impossible, given that anarchism is probably the illest-conceived of any extant ideology.However, because it's ANARCHISM, because the writing is coherent and cleverer than most graphic novels', because it's all draped over with mystery, because it's a well-designed book, tone and layout-wise, and because the art is fantastic, the essential failure of the book-- the fact that it lacks anything behind its shell of hyperenergetic blathering-- gets a pass.Seriously. The book tries so hard to be political and symbolic it crushes itself. Premise-wise, the story doesn't make a lot of sense-- we hear that England was living in a government vacuum for several years, and that London was straight-across flooded, and that every other landmass on the planet has been nuked, AND that a nuclear winter has occurred, but for some reason they're still living in a fully-mechanized modern consumer society. All right. Sure. Also, it appears that the only remaining political ideologies in the universe are Fascism and Socialism/Communism, with Anarchism resting on its own crazy-ass axis out who the hell knows where. All right, again. Beginning to sound more and more like Revolutionary Spain/every third world country ever. Sure. Got that. 'First and freest Republic in the world loses all sense of its political heritage and persecutes the hell out of its inhabitants' is the ONLY trend in British apocalyptic fiction, but this is the worst I've ever seen it done.I don't know. What is Moore posing here as the only options for political ideology? He paints a world in which one can ONLY be EITHER a ethnocentric homophobic racist fascist or an 'anarchist'. All right. What does he mean by this? Returning to a state of nature? Gradual and spontaneous shift to democracy? End of the modern mechanized world? Spontaneous national adoption of a sort of leaderless socialist state? Hmm. Moore handles his material childishly. For me, the political-apocalypse stories that WORK show the protagonists yearning after a state of leave-me-alone-let's-all-be-friends sort of political neutralism-- a state of 'let's have universal human rights and that's all please' joy. A utopia of 'being a normal person'. Children of Men is like this. EvenWatchmenis less heavy on the socialism and focuses more on the 'let's stop being persecutors and start being nice to everyone else again' mentality. Readers can therefore identify with the protagonists-- they aren't radicals. They're just normal people trying to be normal again. But in V for Vendetta, the only way peace can be achieved is if every individual person is a politically-radical crowd member willing to use mob violence.Not inspirational.I don't care what you think about the degree to which individuals must be political to preserve their rights. This book makes no coherent political point and the messages it DOES articulate are comprised solely of platitudes. It fails to rpesent any realistic view of any political spectrum whatsoever. Instead of focusing on human rights/the dignity of man/the right to be free, it sours the whole batch by presenting some shallowly-conceived idea of anarchism as the solution to all modern political crises. The fact is that this book reads like a poorly-contrived piece of anti-Thatcher propaganda.Which is essentially what it is.EDIT: I've read some other reviews of this book on goodreads and I've decided I have to make one point.You CANNOT like this book becuase 'V is an amazing character.' V IS ALMOST NOT A CHARACTER. Moore specifically has him talk about how who he is is not important. V is a big bundle of soggy political ideology stuffed up into a man-suit with a funny mask on the front. The whole backstory bit exists to give the situation-- the SITUATION, not the character-- plausibility. The fact that the backstory even exists sours Moore's ideological point, which is unfortunate, since the point was shallow enough to begin with. V is suppsoed to be an 'everyman', and is supposed to represent the potential in all of us to make a difference. But how did he get like this? First of all, he's insane, mildly or seriously, but slightly insane at some level, at any rate.

            "Translation failed for: Ten Hours later...When I don’t like a series ending, I tell myself it’s partially my own fault - that the book suffered from my expectations. In the case ofAllegiant, I think it went a little beyond that. Hours after finishing and sleeping on my crushing disappointment, I have to admit that very little of this book worked for me. So I’m turning to the device that I always turn to when I’m stressed or overwhelmed with something: lists. As always in a review of this nature, there will beMASSIVE SPOILERSfor all three books in this series. I’m using a cut, and it means very definite business.Things that Did not Work for Me in Allegiant, a List by Kate1. The World BuildingWhen you think about bothDivergentandInsurgent, there was very little actual world building that went on. We established the faction system and the way it functions inDivergent. We also established the problems inherent with that system. InInsurgent, we explored those problems more by watching the breakdown. And then, in the end ofInsurgent, we find out that it’s all an experiment intended to save the outside world from war and violence and poverty.Then, we get toAllegiant. Everything in the video is a lie (so, in a lot of ways, everything Tris did at the end ofInsurgentwas for nothing). The outside world is basically Chicago 2.0, only instead of being divided by personality type people are divided by the extent of their broken genes. It’s an interesting thought and a cool platform for philosophizing, but so much is crammed into this book that we don’t have time for those subtleties. Basically, we have one book to learn the mass of information we need to know about the outside.This info dump is compounded by several things: 1) Everything we thought we knew about the outside is a lie and some things we thought we knew about the people on the inside is a lie, too; 2) Tris knows nothing about the outside so things that we know about as readers keep being off-handedly explained to her and also not explained to her; 3) a lot of what Tris has to figure out is science and history, and there's not the sufficient background needed to help with suspension of disbelief.This is clearly supposed to be far into the future - at least seven generations? - but fundamentally it’s still the world we know. We knew that because of the fact that Chicago was clearly recognizable. But knowing that everything on the outside is basically still functioning through our government and that the same kinds of issues still cause problems? Something about that made me question every piece of information thrown at me.There was too much information introduced in this book for it to be the closing of a series and I honestly think this whole series would have benefited from a fourth book.2. Character Developmenta. The background charactersNone of the background characters went anywhere significant. I did not learn anything new about Cara, Christina, or Uriah. I could have eliminated all three of them from this book and everything would have been the same. Even Uriah’s injury and death felt like a plot point for Four that was ultimately completely glossed over. Peter and Caleb showed no growth or change. Peter proved that he is still the same coward he has always been (and yet somehow he gets exactly what he wants). Caleb, too, proved a coward. He was given the chance for redemption and he didn’t take it.As for Natalie Prior, I thought her backstory was interesting. It was one of the few interesting things about the book, though I thought the “love triangle” was unnecessary and slowed the plot down. I also couldn’t wrap my brain around why, when she found out Tris was divergent, she wouldn’t have told her at least some of this information she knew, something that would help her daughter and her society. And even though it was interesting backstory, it didn’t change Natalie Prior’s motivations for saving her daughter and acting as she did.There was a rash of seemingly senseless deaths in this book. First, Edward dies. But...why? To show that the factionless show as little regard for human life as the Erudite did? For the two page scene in which we don’t know if Evelyn is upset by his death? The same thing with Tori, who died, it seems, simply to provide the moment in which we find out how wrong she was and that her brother now has to deal with her death?But...why do I care about George Wu? This problem ties back to the world-building problem and the need for another book. We are introduced to so many new characters. Some lady whose name I can’t remember, Amar, George, Nita, Matthew, David, all the people from The Fringe. The people from the Fringe? We barely learn anything besides their names. Amar and George are there, it seems, to provide some familiarity for our refugees, but we barely see them and they don’t teach us anything new about the inside or the outside. Then we get to Nita, who plays a major role and then just seems to disappear. Matthew has a nice little speech about the Terrible thing that genetic prejudice caused to happen, but who is also basically a clone of Cara. And David, who is exactly, exactly like Jeanine. Having so many new people cut out our chance to see the people that mattered.Like...b. TrisTris came a long way inInsurgentand she learned a lot of things. I thought, overall, she was doing well and continuing that trend (until the end, which ruined everything). But here was my problem with Tris: besides what happened at the end, was she wrong about ANYTHING in this book? It’s like she could perfectly read every situation and every person, and she was kind of a condescending jerk about it. She wants to act like she’s never been wrong, but I remember her surprise at Caleb’s betrayal. I remember that it took a bit for her to figure out Evelyn was Four’s mother. I remember that she didn’t see Al’s betrayal coming, or even Eric’s. I remember that she didn’t see through Evelyn’s plan until it was already happening. Tris isn’t infallible, and I liked that about her.Those mistakes made Tris human. But inAllegiant?she’s suddenly perfect. She is smart and strong and skilled and canny and selfless to a ridiculous extent. It makes it hard for us to blame Tris when she’s annoyed that people are ignoring her or not trusting her gut. It also makes Four’s journey that much more difficult to handle, because knowing that she’s always right means that he’s always wrong. And he kind of is.c. FourI really wish we had not gotten Four’s point of view in this book. I’d say a big portion of the problems I had stemmed from the dual points of view. Fundamentally, we had to learn everything new through both characters because obviously they reacted differently to everything. This really slowed down the pacing and bogged this book down in repetitive backstory.His sections of the book were indistinguishable in both tone and voice. Though Tris and Four complimented each other so well in the first two books - made an excellent team of equals - they are also very different personality types. Sure, they have similar characteristics - the same kinds of things make them tick - but they go about things in a very different way.I’ll be honest. I didn't find Four likable in this book. I got flashes of the Four I loved, but he was so mired down in all of his weaknesses that reading his portions of the book was really hard. He is the one that was so mad at Tris in the last book for lying, and he is the one that told her at that he should trust her and not hide things from her. But, what happens? Four finds out that he’s not really divergent (um, ok?), and then he completely breaks down and immediately loses all the growth he’d accomplished in the first two books and does something stupid.Part of me understands that the point is that Four isn’t perfect; he has four fears, but those four fears are so much bigger and more terrifying than most people’s ten or twenty (or my thousand). He has Major Issues. However, I knew that about him already. We already watched this struggle with the need to do something to make the world better and also the need to protect Tris and be a good man in the face of incredibly difficult choices. We spent a book watching him deal with his feelings for his mother and father, even if we never watched him deal with those things from this point of view. It was wrenching, but it made him grow.This Four is broken. He has lost all of the defining elements that made him Four. He is weak and indecisive and insecure and, most surprisingly of all, irrational. His participation in Nita’s plan baffles me. Since when has Four ever blindly trusted anyone’s plan (or anyone, for that matter), let alone a stranger’s? Since when does he not at least argue with Tris OR ANYONE about the moral complications of what is happening? It’s one thing for him to go along with Evelyn’s plan (though even then only at first); that relationship and his feelings are complicated. Here, his decision makes no sense. He barely knows Nita. Why is he not working with Cara and Christina and Tris? Why is he not asking that they be involved? It made no sense to me, even in context of losing his identity.And then, his actions and his part in this plan are ignored? There are no consequences aside from the fact that Uriah is unconscious and ultimately dies. (That entire plot point just seemed pointless. Tris is going to be plenty mad about Four being so stupid already; Four is going to feel plenty guilty about acting like a completely naive hayseed without Uriah having to eat it). Then the issue became about Uriah instead of why on earth he made this ridiculous decision and what he was feeling.After this incredibly boneheaded and uncharacteristic decision? I don’t even know what the hell to make of what was going on with Four. I did not understand his motivations. I did not understand the personality he suddenly exhibited. It felt like he was simply moving forward the plot instead of being Four. Plus, he spends all ofAllegiantbeing broken down and we never really see him built back up.3. The PlotThis plot was repetitive. InInsurgent, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews. InAllegiant, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews 2.0/3.0. It is the same struggle. Of course, on one level that makes sense. Tris is chasing this problem up the chain. She’s discovering that the root of this problem is bigger than Jeanine Mathews and that the outside and its problems never really stayed outside. I did appreciate that aspect.The pacing was an issue. It was slowed considerably by the excessive amount of info dumping and also the dual points of view. It also felt formulaic. It was so paint by numbers and repetitive that it became predictable, in part because Tris is always right and in part because there’s no time for nuance thanks to all the random information being thrown about and all the random things that keep happening. And yet, even with the repetition and the predictability and thedeus ex machinamoments, this plot was a confused mess and most of it was completely unnecessary to where we went.And good lord the ending of no sense. The holes in this plot were insane. The main conflict seems to be that the Bureau, who has controlled Chicago and Tris’s life, wants the Chicago experiment to keep going. Tris wants those people to know the truth and be free. (Four doesn’t seem to know what the hell he wants). In order to keep things going, the Bureau wants to wipe the memories of Tris’s friends and the families of her friends. Her grand solution? Wipe the memories of the bureau instead. Erase their memories of genetic prejudice....What?We know there are antidotes to basically every serum, from the death serum to the truth serum. We also know there’s an inoculation to the memory/Abnegation serum. So why does it occur to NO ONE that instead of say, inoculating Christina’s family and Uriah’s, that they, say, INNOCULATE EVERYONE?! If they inoculate the people in Chiacago, then David and the Bureau can't wipe their memories. At the very least, this seemingly obvious solution buys them time to figure out what the hell to do.Instead, it’s decided Caleb will sacrifice himself by breaking into a vault of memory serum and releasing it into the air before the death serum can claim him (which everyone completely 100% believes will happen and it occurs to no one that Tris of all people will never ever let him do this).Four heads into the city to give the memory serum to only one of his parents because he’ll only have time for one but GASP WHICH WILL HE CHOOSE?! Ok. Let’s think about this. The memory serum is intended to allow the two groups in Chicago to come to an agreement. How on earth does giving Marcus the serum help that goal? Evelyn will still remember that he beat her. Evelyn will still remember that he beat Tobias. Evelyn will still want to prove her strength over him because she rightfully HATES Marcus. So clearly Evelyn is the only logical choice because if she can forget what Marcus did to her, what the factions did to her, she can come to an agreement because she’ll have forgotten all the things that motivated her to fight in the first place. Marcus is just a power hungry dickwad, that's fundamental to him like knowing how to breathe. Knowing this (and I don’t understand how you could not, especially in the context of Four’s weird relationship with his mother versus the fact that basically he wants his dad to be dead) all the tension is gone from Four making this decision because we all know there is no decision.Of course, knowing this, we also know that Four is never going to give his mother the memory serum. What is completely unbelievable in the end is that Evelyn - the same Evelyn who has proven herself to be a dictator and a tyrant, who abandoned Four, who lied to Four, who tried to push away the only person who has ever supported Four and believed in him in his entire life, the same person who has been motivated by nothing but hate of the factions with seemingly little thought to her son - is magically made reasonable by love of her son....what?This makes no sense in the context of what we know about Evelyn based on what we’ve seen her do. She doesn’t even argue with Tobias. It’s just sobbing hugs and forgetting everything she’s done so she can have the PROSPECT of her son one day being in her life. I’m supposed to believe this because we had a scene with her staring at the blue vase she gave him? And, of course, they go out and shake hands with Johanna and Marcus gets his just desserts because everyone knows he is an evil scumbag bent on power and everything magically works out fine despite the fact that people were rioting in the first chapter and the rest of the factionless are just going to forget their anger because they love Tobias...oh wait.Meanwhile, back in the compound...4. The Message?I knew in my gut as soon as I started reading the second instance of Tobias’s point of view that Tris would die. But still, I hoped I was wrong. I wanted to be wrong. And I wanted to be wrong because it doesn’t make any sense with Tris's growth.Every. Single. Book. Every single book Tris goes off to do some sacrificial act to save the people she cares about. That is basically all she does in Insurgent. And what is her lesson at the end of Insurgent? She wants to live. She doesn’t want to die - she wants to fight and save the world. But we all know as readers, from the moment they mention that stupid vault’s booby trap, that Tris is going to walk into it. We know she is. And...I hated it.First of all, it completely screwed the little character development we’d seen from Caleb. Oh, so Tris points a gun to your head to make you give you the backpack? And you believe her? Stupidest Erudite EVER. Because why would she shoot you, you idiot, if she is about to walk into a death serum pressure cooker TO SAVE YOUR LIFE? It was believable when Tris said she’d shoot David to keep them from getting the password. But she doesn’t want Caleb to die. When he lets her have the backpack - when he lets Tris walk into that chamber? - I have never been so disappointed.I was disappointed in Tris too, because she stole Caleb's redemption. Maybe he lives and redeems himself in some other way, though considering he was an accessory to the slaughter of an entire faction, betrayed his sister, and is generally of weak character, why would anyone believe that he can redeem himself in any other way? So at gunpoint, she steps up to make this sacrifice and we all knew she was going to do it all along and how did Tobias not?I don’t mind character deaths in books. I think, when handled correctly, they are touching scenes that teach the reader something. I think about Dumbledore dying and my chest aches. I think about so many other deaths in books, from Rue in Hunger Games to Bridge to Terebethia, and I know that deaths of characters you love can matter and make a book beautiful and better and teach you things about yourself and the world and love and all of it.But the death has to matter. And Tris’s didn’t. In the (very rushed) end, we find out that people can depend on each other? Can mend each other? We find out that Four is still grieving Tris but is maybe starting to move on, that he doesn’t talk or think about her much because of how much it hurts? Is Peter right? Tobias is young. Someday he’ll move on and he’ll remember Tris, but he’ll keep living. And it’s true; moving on is brave. That’s what life is and what it requires and we have to be grateful for the moments we spend with the people we love and the impact they have. But I needed so much more from Tobias at the end to make his loss of Tris worth that message.I hated, too, the way Tris’s death was handled. Because what was Tris doing? She was running into her mother’s arms and asking if she could be finished. Wanting to be done, implying a choice, even though she JUST told Caleb to tell Tobias that she didn’t want to leave him. If she’d gone down fighting, I’d have bought this more. But she seemed to welcome death - to want it - and that reverts her straight back to the things she supposedly learned she DIDN’T want inInsurgentI don’t understand why Tris’s death did anything to make that message more real. If anything it makes it less so. It’s easy to band together in grief - to find the people who understand and cling to them and form a stronger bond while you do. We saw that already with Christina and Uriah. I think this book wouldn’t have been able to gloss over everything if Tris had lived. Like Uriah’s injury and demise, a lot of this ending was hurriedly tied up with her death. We didn’t have to see what really happened in the aftermath. We didn’t have to deal with the choices for society. Tris’s death was sand for the characters to bury their heads in.This book didn't have a hopeful ending because nothing really changed. 90% of the characters are dead and everyone forgives everyone almost everything because they care about them? This is the foundation of rebuilding and stability upon which these characters and this world can grow? I’d have given up Tris (and Tris and Four) if it left Four and the the people she cared about with strength and hope and a better world, but I didn’t see that it did.Things that Worked for me in Allegiant, a list by Kate1. There was a lot of making out.2. Though I wanted more from the ending, Four's pain was certainly poignant., error: Ten Hours later...When I don’t like a series ending, I tell myself it’s partially my own fault - that the book suffered from my expectations. In the case ofAllegiant, I think it went a little beyond that. Hours after finishing and sleeping on my crushing disappointment, I have to admit that very little of this book worked for me. So I’m turning to the device that I always turn to when I’m stressed or overwhelmed with something: lists. As always in a review of this nature, there will beMASSIVE SPOILERSfor all three books in this series. I’m using a cut, and it means very definite business.Things that Did not Work for Me in Allegiant, a List by Kate1. The World BuildingWhen you think about bothDivergentandInsurgent, there was very little actual world building that went on. We established the faction system and the way it functions inDivergent. We also established the problems inherent with that system. InInsurgent, we explored those problems more by watching the breakdown. And then, in the end ofInsurgent, we find out that it’s all an experiment intended to save the outside world from war and violence and poverty.Then, we get toAllegiant. Everything in the video is a lie (so, in a lot of ways, everything Tris did at the end ofInsurgentwas for nothing). The outside world is basically Chicago 2.0, only instead of being divided by personality type people are divided by the extent of their broken genes. It’s an interesting thought and a cool platform for philosophizing, but so much is crammed into this book that we don’t have time for those subtleties. Basically, we have one book to learn the mass of information we need to know about the outside.This info dump is compounded by several things: 1) Everything we thought we knew about the outside is a lie and some things we thought we knew about the people on the inside is a lie, too; 2) Tris knows nothing about the outside so things that we know about as readers keep being off-handedly explained to her and also not explained to her; 3) a lot of what Tris has to figure out is science and history, and there's not the sufficient background needed to help with suspension of disbelief.This is clearly supposed to be far into the future - at least seven generations? - but fundamentally it’s still the world we know. We knew that because of the fact that Chicago was clearly recognizable. But knowing that everything on the outside is basically still functioning through our government and that the same kinds of issues still cause problems? Something about that made me question every piece of information thrown at me.There was too much information introduced in this book for it to be the closing of a series and I honestly think this whole series would have benefited from a fourth book.2. Character Developmenta. The background charactersNone of the background characters went anywhere significant. I did not learn anything new about Cara, Christina, or Uriah. I could have eliminated all three of them from this book and everything would have been the same. Even Uriah’s injury and death felt like a plot point for Four that was ultimately completely glossed over. Peter and Caleb showed no growth or change. Peter proved that he is still the same coward he has always been (and yet somehow he gets exactly what he wants). Caleb, too, proved a coward. He was given the chance for redemption and he didn’t take it.As for Natalie Prior, I thought her backstory was interesting. It was one of the few interesting things about the book, though I thought the “love triangle” was unnecessary and slowed the plot down. I also couldn’t wrap my brain around why, when she found out Tris was divergent, she wouldn’t have told her at least some of this information she knew, something that would help her daughter and her society. And even though it was interesting backstory, it didn’t change Natalie Prior’s motivations for saving her daughter and acting as she did.There was a rash of seemingly senseless deaths in this book. First, Edward dies. But...why? To show that the factionless show as little regard for human life as the Erudite did? For the two page scene in which we don’t know if Evelyn is upset by his death? The same thing with Tori, who died, it seems, simply to provide the moment in which we find out how wrong she was and that her brother now has to deal with her death?But...why do I care about George Wu? This problem ties back to the world-building problem and the need for another book. We are introduced to so many new characters. Some lady whose name I can’t remember, Amar, George, Nita, Matthew, David, all the people from The Fringe. The people from the Fringe? We barely learn anything besides their names. Amar and George are there, it seems, to provide some familiarity for our refugees, but we barely see them and they don’t teach us anything new about the inside or the outside. Then we get to Nita, who plays a major role and then just seems to disappear. Matthew has a nice little speech about the Terrible thing that genetic prejudice caused to happen, but who is also basically a clone of Cara. And David, who is exactly, exactly like Jeanine. Having so many new people cut out our chance to see the people that mattered.Like...b. TrisTris came a long way inInsurgentand she learned a lot of things. I thought, overall, she was doing well and continuing that trend (until the end, which ruined everything). But here was my problem with Tris: besides what happened at the end, was she wrong about ANYTHING in this book? It’s like she could perfectly read every situation and every person, and she was kind of a condescending jerk about it. She wants to act like she’s never been wrong, but I remember her surprise at Caleb’s betrayal. I remember that it took a bit for her to figure out Evelyn was Four’s mother. I remember that she didn’t see Al’s betrayal coming, or even Eric’s. I remember that she didn’t see through Evelyn’s plan until it was already happening. Tris isn’t infallible, and I liked that about her.Those mistakes made Tris human. But inAllegiant?she’s suddenly perfect. She is smart and strong and skilled and canny and selfless to a ridiculous extent. It makes it hard for us to blame Tris when she’s annoyed that people are ignoring her or not trusting her gut. It also makes Four’s journey that much more difficult to handle, because knowing that she’s always right means that he’s always wrong. And he kind of is.c. FourI really wish we had not gotten Four’s point of view in this book. I’d say a big portion of the problems I had stemmed from the dual points of view. Fundamentally, we had to learn everything new through both characters because obviously they reacted differently to everything. This really slowed down the pacing and bogged this book down in repetitive backstory.His sections of the book were indistinguishable in both tone and voice. Though Tris and Four complimented each other so well in the first two books - made an excellent team of equals - they are also very different personality types. Sure, they have similar characteristics - the same kinds of things make them tick - but they go about things in a very different way.I’ll be honest. I didn't find Four likable in this book. I got flashes of the Four I loved, but he was so mired down in all of his weaknesses that reading his portions of the book was really hard. He is the one that was so mad at Tris in the last book for lying, and he is the one that told her at that he should trust her and not hide things from her. But, what happens? Four finds out that he’s not really divergent (um, ok?), and then he completely breaks down and immediately loses all the growth he’d accomplished in the first two books and does something stupid.Part of me understands that the point is that Four isn’t perfect; he has four fears, but those four fears are so much bigger and more terrifying than most people’s ten or twenty (or my thousand). He has Major Issues. However, I knew that about him already. We already watched this struggle with the need to do something to make the world better and also the need to protect Tris and be a good man in the face of incredibly difficult choices. We spent a book watching him deal with his feelings for his mother and father, even if we never watched him deal with those things from this point of view. It was wrenching, but it made him grow.This Four is broken. He has lost all of the defining elements that made him Four. He is weak and indecisive and insecure and, most surprisingly of all, irrational. His participation in Nita’s plan baffles me. Since when has Four ever blindly trusted anyone’s plan (or anyone, for that matter), let alone a stranger’s? Since when does he not at least argue with Tris OR ANYONE about the moral complications of what is happening? It’s one thing for him to go along with Evelyn’s plan (though even then only at first); that relationship and his feelings are complicated. Here, his decision makes no sense. He barely knows Nita. Why is he not working with Cara and Christina and Tris? Why is he not asking that they be involved? It made no sense to me, even in context of losing his identity.And then, his actions and his part in this plan are ignored? There are no consequences aside from the fact that Uriah is unconscious and ultimately dies. (That entire plot point just seemed pointless. Tris is going to be plenty mad about Four being so stupid already; Four is going to feel plenty guilty about acting like a completely naive hayseed without Uriah having to eat it). Then the issue became about Uriah instead of why on earth he made this ridiculous decision and what he was feeling.After this incredibly boneheaded and uncharacteristic decision? I don’t even know what the hell to make of what was going on with Four. I did not understand his motivations. I did not understand the personality he suddenly exhibited. It felt like he was simply moving forward the plot instead of being Four. Plus, he spends all ofAllegiantbeing broken down and we never really see him built back up.3. The PlotThis plot was repetitive. InInsurgent, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews. InAllegiant, we have to overthrow the tyranny of Jeanine Mathews 2.0/3.0. It is the same struggle. Of course, on one level that makes sense. Tris is chasing this problem up the chain. She’s discovering that the root of this problem is bigger than Jeanine Mathews and that the outside and its problems never really stayed outside. I did appreciate that aspect.The pacing was an issue. It was slowed considerably by the excessive amount of info dumping and also the dual points of view. It also felt formulaic. It was so paint by numbers and repetitive that it became predictable, in part because Tris is always right and in part because there’s no time for nuance thanks to all the random information being thrown about and all the random things that keep happening. And yet, even with the repetition and the predictability and thedeus ex machinamoments, this plot was a confused mess and most of it was completely unnecessary to where we went.And good lord the ending of no sense. The holes in this plot were insane. The main conflict seems to be that the Bureau, who has controlled Chicago and Tris’s life, wants the Chicago experiment to keep going. Tris wants those people to know the truth and be free. (Four doesn’t seem to know what the hell he wants). In order to keep things going, the Bureau wants to wipe the memories of Tris’s friends and the families of her friends. Her grand solution? Wipe the memories of the bureau instead. Erase their memories of genetic prejudice....What?We know there are antidotes to basically every serum, from the death serum to the truth serum. We also know there’s an inoculation to the memory/Abnegation serum. So why does it occur to NO ONE that instead of say, inoculating Christina’s family and Uriah’s, that they, say, INNOCULATE EVERYONE?! If they inoculate the people in Chiacago, then David and the Bureau can't wipe their memories. At the very least, this seemingly obvious solution buys them time to figure out what the hell to do.Instead, it’s decided Caleb will sacrifice himself by breaking into a vault of memory serum and releasing it into the air before the death serum can claim him (which everyone completely 100% believes will happen and it occurs to no one that Tris of all people will never ever let him do this).Four heads into the city to give the memory serum to only one of his parents because he’ll only have time for one but GASP WHICH WILL HE CHOOSE?! Ok. Let’s think about this. The memory serum is intended to allow the two groups in Chicago to come to an agreement. How on earth does giving Marcus the serum help that goal? Evelyn will still remember that he beat her. Evelyn will still remember that he beat Tobias. Evelyn will still want to prove her strength over him because she rightfully HATES Marcus. So clearly Evelyn is the only logical choice because if she can forget what Marcus did to her, what the factions did to her, she can come to an agreement because she’ll have forgotten all the things that motivated her to fight in the first place. Marcus is just a power hungry dickwad, that's fundamental to him like knowing how to breathe. Knowing this (and I don’t understand how you could not, especially in the context of Four’s weird relationship with his mother versus the fact that basically he wants his dad to be dead) all the tension is gone from Four making this decision because we all know there is no decision.Of course, knowing this, we also know that Four is never going to give his mother the memory serum. What is completely unbelievable in the end is that Evelyn - the same Evelyn who has proven herself to be a dictator and a tyrant, who abandoned Four, who lied to Four, who tried to push away the only person who has ever supported Four and believed in him in his entire life, the same person who has been motivated by nothing but hate of the factions with seemingly little thought to her son - is magically made reasonable by love of her son....what?This makes no sense in the context of what we know about Evelyn based on what we’ve seen her do. She doesn’t even argue with Tobias. It’s just sobbing hugs and forgetting everything she’s done so she can have the PROSPECT of her son one day being in her life. I’m supposed to believe this because we had a scene with her staring at the blue vase she gave him? And, of course, they go out and shake hands with Johanna and Marcus gets his just desserts because everyone knows he is an evil scumbag bent on power and everything magically works out fine despite the fact that people were rioting in the first chapter and the rest of the factionless are just going to forget their anger because they love Tobias...oh wait.Meanwhile, back in the compound...4. The Message?I knew in my gut as soon as I started reading the second instance of Tobias’s point of view that Tris would die. But still, I hoped I was wrong. I wanted to be wrong. And I wanted to be wrong because it doesn’t make any sense with Tris's growth.Every. Single. Book. Every single book Tris goes off to do some sacrificial act to save the people she cares about. That is basically all she does in Insurgent. And what is her lesson at the end of Insurgent? She wants to live. She doesn’t want to die - she wants to fight and save the world. But we all know as readers, from the moment they mention that stupid vault’s booby trap, that Tris is going to walk into it. We know she is. And...I hated it.First of all, it completely screwed the little character development we’d seen from Caleb. Oh, so Tris points a gun to your head to make you give you the backpack? And you believe her? Stupidest Erudite EVER. Because why would she shoot you, you idiot, if she is about to walk into a death serum pressure cooker TO SAVE YOUR LIFE? It was believable when Tris said she’d shoot David to keep them from getting the password. But she doesn’t want Caleb to die. When he lets her have the backpack - when he lets Tris walk into that chamber? - I have never been so disappointed.I was disappointed in Tris too, because she stole Caleb's redemption. Maybe he lives and redeems himself in some other way, though considering he was an accessory to the slaughter of an entire faction, betrayed his sister, and is generally of weak character, why would anyone believe that he can redeem himself in any other way? So at gunpoint, she steps up to make this sacrifice and we all knew she was going to do it all along and how did Tobias not?I don’t mind character deaths in books. I think, when handled correctly, they are touching scenes that teach the reader something. I think about Dumbledore dying and my chest aches. I think about so many other deaths in books, from Rue in Hunger Games to Bridge to Terebethia, and I know that deaths of characters you love can matter and make a book beautiful and better and teach you things about yourself and the world and love and all of it.But the death has to matter. And Tris’s didn’t. In the (very rushed) end, we find out that people can depend on each other? Can mend each other? We find out that Four is still grieving Tris but is maybe starting to move on, that he doesn’t talk or think about her much because of how much it hurts? Is Peter right? Tobias is young. Someday he’ll move on and he’ll remember Tris, but he’ll keep living. And it’s true; moving on is brave. That’s what life is and what it requires and we have to be grateful for the moments we spend with the people we love and the impact they have. But I needed so much more from Tobias at the end to make his loss of Tris worth that message.I hated, too, the way Tris’s death was handled. Because what was Tris doing?

            "Translation failed for: Where, oh where do I start with this review? I noticed a few months ago that this book kept appearing in others' Favorites lists, impressed that it has such a following after 20 years. My overall verdict is that I derived some enjoyment from reading the book, at least in parts, but found it to be incredibly lacking and frustrating in others. Part of my issue with this book was that it was just plain written wrong. Not necessarily badly, just wrong. Had the entire story been written by a more adept author, it would have been, first, believable, and second, influential. *SPOILER ALERT!*When I started reading the story, I found the main character, Peekay, endearing. He was just the type of character that makes a book vivid and appealing. I enjoyed the beginning stories of Peekay and Nanny, of Peekay and Grandpa Chook, of the horrible Judge and Jury at boarding school, and especially enjoyed Peekay's introduction to boxing by Hoppie. But as soon as Peekay had his life's ambition set in stone (to be the Welterweight Champion of the World), my issues with the story began in earnest. I started with these questions:What was the purpose in Peekay's name? (The reader doesn't really find out. It's a gimmick. I think the author wanted the reader to divine that Peekay chose his own path, and thus his own name, his strange name of Peekay sets him apart from others and it's supposed to give weight to The Power of One title. All of these literary tools are fine and good when done correctly. Courtenay just doesn't deliver here.As I moved through the book, I started tallying up everything that Peekay could do (and do amazingly), and those things he failed at. Let's see:He had a magical chicken.He easily recognizes and can verbalize his distrust of Evangelicalism, and makes conscious decisions about his religious beliefs (starting at what, age 5?)He befriends much older people than himself and essentially lives in their world as a peer.He becomes an expert on succulents.He is by far the best student at school.He recognizes the cruelty inherent in Apartheid and racisim, despite being raised by a cooky Evangelical mother and incommunicative grandfather.He has an innate ability to connect with people of all races. Going along with this:He can speak about, oh, 5 different languages fluently.He is able to relate with prisoners and vice versa.He develops a highly functional letter-writing and smuggling operation in the prison.He finds the Crystal Cave of Africa with his best friend, Doc, who is about 80 years old. I can't even get into the whole \"Crystal Cave of Africa\" commentary. What was that about?Doc composes a piece that unites all the African tribes of prisoner in joyous song, a feat which Peekay instigated and the piece later becomes basically the \"anthem\" of Africa.He is essentially a Jesus like figure to the African people the entire way through the book.He is accepted into the elite academic team called \"Sinjun's People\" - there is no point to this story in the book, for it adds nothing to the mix aside from one more example of how amazing Peekay is.He is an excellent rugby player.He is an excellent chess player.He starts a school of literacy for black Africans.He can debate with his friend Morrie in the same unbelievable way that the Dawson's Creek kids could speak way too well for their age.He is naturally an expert mine worker.He wins EVERY SINGLE BOXING MATCH he has ever been in.He fails at nothing.These are just a sample of my observations (there is a word limit on these reviews).I was quickly tired of all these amazing things that Peekay could do, or be, or amount to. I was increasingly frustrated with Courtenay’s unforgivable mistakes. If only he had not written it in first person. If you have 500 pages of a small boy telling you how amazing he is, and how he is a legend to the people of Africa, then you start to think him a bit big for his britches. I felt like Courtenay had just read A Prayer for Owen Meany and decided to write a book about a smaller-than-average boy dealing with injustices and obstacles, who nonetheless overcomes his situation. (Is it a coincidence that Owen Meany was also published in 1989?) But the difference is that Owen Meany was written in third person. And it was written by Irving, who knows how to write about a savior-like figure and legend without instilling disbelief in the reader. And Irving doesn't choose such a predicable, non-descript title for his books, either. \"The Power of One\" could be the title to any Barnes & Noble featured self-help book on improving your self-image. It's a ridiculous concept for a boy of 5 to grasp and work toward all his life. And it's a crummy title for a fictional book.Finally, the ending. Oh, the ending. I sensed that Courtenay was done writing about Peekay, so he just gave up. He sent Peekay off to work in the mines. Peekay almost gets killed but miraculously doesn't. Frankly, I was wishing he would be killed because at least that ending would have reinforced the entire 500 page theme of \"Peekay as a martyr for the African people.\" Oh wait - that would have been way too dangerously close to plagiarizing Owen Meany.So instead Peekay is recovering from the accident and, in the final pages of the book, encounters a crazed Botho, ironically the man on the other end of Peekay's extraordinary mining work - the man that has reaped the rewards and riches of Peekay's fantastic ability in the mines. Botho is out to kill Peekay (only because he is drug induced by the fumes of the mines) and, surprise, surprise, turns out to be the former childhood bully of Peekay's; the individual whose terror upon Peekay spawned the concept of \"The Power of One\" - to overcome adversity, depending only upon yourself. What irony - Peekay and \"The Judge\" (Botho) meet again in such circumstances! Once again, Courtenay has the chance to really set the story on edge and have Botho kill Peekay, thus shattering all hope of Peekay being the most amazing person that ever lived. Our fearless Peekay instead beats Botho to a pulp. And the book ends.That's it, it's over. All this talk about his number one goal of being Welterweight Champion of World. Courtenay doesn't even give the reader the courtesy of telling us how he accomplishes the goal.This book got me more worked up than others I have read, for the simple fact that the story really did have potential. It was a worthy piece of fiction that was destroyed by ineptitude. What a shame., error: Where, oh where do I start with this review?

The early Potter books are cute and entertaining, and J.K. Rowling seems like a nice person - if someone's going to scoop the literary Powerball jackpot, why not her? What I very strongly object to is the way the books have been marketed. About 10 years ago, it seems to me, some clever people figured out a new marketing strategy, which they first applied to Potter; when that came to an end, the same methods were used for Twilight. Both series have enjoyed a level of success which is utterly disproportionate to their quality, and which is also unprecedented in literary history. Twilight clearly follows Potter; I've had several discussions about what preceded Potter, and the answer, everyone seems to agree, is that there was no earlier success story of this kind. Before Potter, there was no YA series of dubious merit that absolutely everyone read.I think it's uncontroversial that Potter, in terms of literary quality, is better than Twilight, but Twilight has been even more successful. At one point, the four volumes occupied the top four spots in the New York Times bestseller list. On Goodreads, nearly half of the top 50 reviews are of Twilight books. This is an absurd and unnatural state of affairs. Even though Twilight may not be quite as bad as is sometimes made out - I'm one of many people who have tried to defend it - there's no way it deserves this level of attention.So why is everyone reading it, and why, before that, was everyone reading Potter? As I said, I think it's primarily about the marketing, though I wish I was more sure about the details. Here, at any rate, are some thoughts. First, the publishers are aggressively using economies of scale and deals with third parties. They print very large numbers of copies, and they work together with movie studios, game companies and merchandisers to cross-promote them. I think it's particularly important that a large proportion of the books are sold, not at bookstores, but at normal supermarkets. It's well known that the cover price is usually marked down to the point where the supermarket is not in fact making any profit; they have discovered that they can successfully treat it as a loss leader. This is causing great pain to independent bookstores. Some of them, I have read, have adopted the desperate expedient of buying copies at supermarkets and then reselling them.Second, let's look at the content and style. Even though Potter and Twilight are fairly different in some ways, they also have many strong similarities. Above all, they are extremely easy to read, at every level. The vocabulary is unchallenging; the sentences are short and simple; most characters are one-dimensional stereotypes; the story is uncomplicatedly plot-driven; there are few references to other works of literature. You can read these books if you're tired, if you're sleepy, if you have poor reading skills, if you've never read anything else. They consequently have a very large potential audience.Third, they describe a comforting, emasculated world in which most of the things that make our own world so difficult and unpleasant have been removed. Most strikingly, there is no sex; in Harry Potter, which is supposed to be about fairly normal teens, no one masturbates, no girls get pregnant, none of them are labelled sluts because they've had sex with more than one boy (sometimes one is enough, for that matter), no one gets their heart broken and drops out of school or starts taking drugs as a result, no one is stuck in a dead-end relationship that they wish they could escape from, but can't. The worst thing that happens in either series is the sequence inNew Moonwhere Edward temporarily leaves Bella. Meyer notoriously doesn't describe Bella's feelings at all, but just leaves several pages blank. Once, in fact not so long ago, most adults would have been embarrassed to be seen reading YA literature of this kind; to start with, the comforting word \"YA\" hadn't been invented yet, and they would have been reading children's books. Somehow, there's been a shift in standards. You look around you on a bus to see what people are reading, and you can be pretty sure you'll see at least a couple of people over 20 engrossed in Potter or Twilight. It's odd that this has happened, and I wish I understood why.In conclusion, I couldn't help being struck by the two books D chose to contrast against Potter. D,Madame Bovaryis going to outlast both of these authors because Emma is a real person who experiences the crazy and contradictory emotions that real people experience when they are very unhappy, and as a result she behaves in a crazy and contradictory way; also, Flaubert, unlike Rowling and Meyer, took a great deal of trouble over his prose, and created some of the most beautiful and ironic passages in world literature.

Isn't that where the only blame should be placed?\"━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━tw: graphic domestic violence, graphic attempted rape, suicide, depression, alcohol abuse, depressionUpdate:One of my Goodreads friends broughtthis articleto my attention: an article by domesticshelters.org that outlines the harmfulness of this book. Definitely worth the read.I’ve rewritten this review three times now, andeach time I’ve felt it necessary to lower my rating.I don’t intend for this to be a hot take. I’m not trying to be unique or quirky for disliking a popular book but every day I grow more and more concerned with the number of people who misinterpret and romanticize this book. There will be spoilers in this review.I’d like to begin by acknowledging Colleen Hoover’s intent with this book and how I believe it is a serious problem.Firstly,Colleen Hoover has expressed her disapproval and dislike for trigger warnings.She expressed that“as a fellow reader with my fair share of past experiences, I understand that there are issues some people do not want to read about. But as a writer, there are many things I don’t want revealed in the blurbs of my books.”This is extremely irresponsible and inconsiderate of an author.Furthermore, this book has been and is marketed as a love triangle andColleen Hoover employs the fact that Ryle is an abusive fucker as a plot-twist.In the author’s note, she states that “In the past, I’ve always said I write for entertainment purposes only. I don’t write to educate, persuade or inform. This book is different.”Yet, she continues to format this more serious book, similarly.Furthermore, although I understand that Colleen“wanted to write something realistic to the situation my mother was in – a situation a lot of women find themselves in”, I feel that Ryle was very different to her father.This coming explanation is just my presumption and random thought process. I could have greatly misinterpreted what Colleen went through and I do not mean to be disrespectful.I do not doubt that domestic abuse can be very different, but I believe the fact that Colleen’s father was an alcoholic has a huge impact on her final opinion of him. One could argue that her father needed help, and that although he is to blame, it did not come purely from malintent and manipulation. I am not saying that he is redeemable by any means, only that part of the violence can be due to an unintentional factor. Ryle still ends up having custody over the baby. This is infuriating to me.But we see that she wrote it this way because Colleen still had a relationship with her abusive father after her mother divorced him.Then we have the way that Colleen's father continues to (in my opinion) manipulate her by showing kind, good aspects of himself, like agreeing and encouraging Colleen’s stepfather to walk her down the isle rather than him. Just a thought or something to possibly consider.And in this book, we see Ryle presented as, not a bad person, instead, only a\"person who does bad things\".Now, I've been thinking about this line.I wonder if it was Colleen’s intention to have Ryle say this line to purposefully show how he manipulates Lily into having this mindset or if Colleen really does think this way.Ryle is indeed a bad person, and abuser who is irredeemable. I understand and agree that it is at times, difficult to label someone as “bad” or “good” as it is more complicated than that. But there comes a point, that person is a bad person (for instance, when he tries to horrifically rape her and guilt-tripped Lily with his trauma). Colleen attempts to evoke confliction in the reader by writing in that Ryle donates to charity. Yet, this is not enough. One donation does not make you a good person, especially when compared to the severe harm that you’ve caused others. I cannot believe that after Ryle attempted to rape Lily, there are still Ryle apologists out there. That moment was absolutely mortifying.Regardless, the general plotline of this book is supposed to be that Ryle starts off as being a kind, loveable man with whom Lily and the reader fall in love with. But, his abusive and manipulative tendencies are slowly revealed until it becomes clear that he is an abuser and that this is a case of domestic abuse. However,from the beginning of the book, Ryle is already portrayed as a concerningly violent and manipulative man.We are introduced to his character when Lily finds him kicking a chair out of anger, something unacceptable and very worrying. Later on,he begs and successfully coerces Lily into having sex with him, purely and solely because he wants to.Unfortunately, at this point in the story, many people still like, possibly even love, Ryle. This is not the \"turning point\" per se.I’ve also recently seen many people criticizing Colleen Hoover’s ability to write a healthy relationship and I’m beginning to agree. Although I remember enjoying Ugly Love, it was certainly unhealthy, specifically in the way that our female main character was treated. Then I began to read \"November 9\" and was utterly mortified by the way Ben, our love interest, acted. There are plenty of reviews with quotes etc. that show how horribly and scarily Ben treated Fallon from the beginning, before the plot twist.So, I conclude that Colleen’s failure to properly structure a base for the story to build upon was a main concern.In regards to Ryle’s trauma,it is something that he weaponizes to manipulate and guilt-trip Lily.It does not excuse the abuse and I think it’s gravely concerning for people to blame the abuse on his trauma. Although it’s understandable to feel bad for what he had to go through, it is all used to manipulate and abuse Lily.Then we have Atlas. When I first read this book, I was quite taken with how caring and sweet Lily and Atlas’ childhood romance seemed to be. But upon reflection, I’ve become more and more concerned by Atlas’ presence in this book at all.I’ve seen countless girls swooning over the“I know it wasn’t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there”line, yetAtlas had sex with Lily while she was a minor.I question why Colleen Hoover would choose to make it that way. It’s extremely unnecessary and the illegality of it could have been easily avoided had she chosen for them to be the same age.This again shows Colleen’s inability to write healthy relationships.Furthermore, I found that the side romance in general greatly took away from the purpose of the book.The fact that Lily had to be saved by another man is truly a damaging thing to portray. Many women who experience domestic abuse do not have the option to leave just because there is a better man out there and it’s also damaging to make it seem that Lily is simply picking between Ryle or Atlas.Moreover, this expands my discontent with howColleen chose to shove in aspects of her usual work to something so serious.A side love story was truly unnecessary for this, but I believe Colleen knew that if she wrote something without romance, it would not sell. Can I blame her for that? I’m not quite sure, but it certainly does not please me.Deriving from what I’ve mentioned so far, particularly about Ryle,it bothers me how little conclusion Colleen offers at the end of the book.I have had to have conversation after conversation with people who misinterpreted the book, who still forgive Ryle and who think of “It Ends With Us” as a romance book. For a while, my challenge question (for friend requests) was “What is your favourite (dark) romance book and why?” And I cannot tell you the number of times people answered with “It Ends With Us”. Some people write in their reviews that even though Ryle was not Lily’s ultimate partner and just because it “did not work out”, they will still have love for Ryle in their heart and think that he just needs help. And unfortunately, I don’t think these people are to blame.With Colleen still allowing Ryle to have custody, it almost allows for a small redemption for his character. And I believe at the end of the book, Colleen should have written one page with the cycle of abuse and how it was shown throughout the novel, and a conclusion expressing that if you love Ryle,you should not,because everything that he did, he did itconsciously and with purpose, through manipulation and guilt-tripping(weaponizing his trauma). I do appreciate however, that she included the domestic abuse hotlines.I also thinkit is unacceptable for people to be recommending this book as just a “sad book” or a “book to make you cry”, becausediminishing a book that explores such a difficult and serious topic like domestic abuse, to an object that simply serves the purpose of evoking emotions from you, is extremely disrespectful and shallow.Especially considering that this is such a personal book to Colleen Hoover.Another thing that I found to be really damaging about this book isthe audience.There is this#coquetteaesthetic on tiktok that I am sure you are aware of. I really to like the look of it etc. But it is a theme among this aesthetic to read books like \"It Ends With Us\" and \"Lolita\". I believe both of these texts are greatly misinterpreted, especially considering that it is often young girls who are reading these books from the ages of 11-15. Ignoring Lolita as that is a different topic,I am nearly certain that these girls buy books like “It Ends With Us” purely for the cover.It's pink. And it fits the aesthetic.I see people saying that they \"love\" “It Ends With Us” and I find it greatly concerning. What do you love about it? I see people ignoring Lily's plotline and just adoring Atlas and his whole \"I know it wasn't a pity fuck, Lily. I was there.\" They've transformed this as something to romanticise. Not to mention thatI also see girls giggle at what seems to be a little inside joke of theirs when they quote\"where did you get the magnet lily\"or\"you fell down the stairs\".I am really beginning to think that this book has done more harm than good.The writing wasn’t something I had a problem with.When I see people criticize Colleen Hoover, it tends to be becausethey call her writing “wattpad writing” which is stupid, because people will say that any contemporary romance has “wattpad writing”.That’s not a great criticism, they should actually elaborate. Other than the quotes that I’ve disagreed with like“There’s no such thing as a bad person, only people who do bad things”, I found that Colleen Hoover’s writing flows well and that she has some iconic, well thought out quotes.I wasn’t a huge fan of Lily writing her letters to Ellenand I didn’t really care at first, but in the Acknowledgement section of “It Ends With Us”, Colleen actually says thankyou to Ellen DeGeneres saying that she is“light when it comes to darkness”. Considering what an awful person everyone knows that Ellen is, I again struggle to understand why Colleen chose this specific detail when she could have chosen someone that was a much better person and influence. *I have been informed that because this book was written in 2016, Ellen was not known to be a bad person,although I still question Colleen's decision to make Lily write letters to a talk show host.Veering off that topic and coming back to my problems with Ryle, is thatI strongly despised how he cared for Lily when she was pregnant.I felt that Ryle cared more about the baby than Lily, and it continues to portray women as baby machines who are made to serve a purpose.The way he cared for her stomach and touched her stomach rather than her. It’s disgusting.Something that also boiled my blood isthe internal misogynythat I see Colleen weave into her books.Lily chooses to not decide whether to divorce Ryle or not until after she has the baby becauseshe believes that her decision would be affected by her hormones.What the fuck?????? Was the fact that he tried to rape you and then he beat you not clear enough?Furthermore, when Lily is trying to explain to Ryle that she wants to divorce him, she tells him something along the lines of“what if this baby girl came home to you and told you ‘daddy, this boy hits me but he apologized and said he wouldn’t do it again’, what if she came home with bruises”, and only then does that garner any sympathy from Ryle.This situation parallels the instances when men only feel remorse for things like sexual assault when they are told ‘what if it was your mother and sister’.It’s horrible and it made me deeply upset that I’ve seen reviews admiring how Ryle was “understanding” after Lily explained that to him.I believe Lily was a strong character to a degree and I agreed with the way she responded to certain things (or I would have done the same), but there are times where I would have been gone, and Lily stayed (like when Ryle begged her for sex). Still, you can really tell she did have a certain level of logic and reason, and tried to confront Ryle.Something that really bugged me was the characterDevinand how Colleen Hoover writes him asthegay stereotype.He's overly touchy with Lily, touching her breasts and pulling down her bra without her consent. This is truly such a disgusting and rude way to portray characters of the lgbtq+ community, especially considering that Colleen Hoover rarely diversifies her books(very few poc + lgbtq characters). It mainly frustrates me because Colleen Hoover clearly has a huge income from the sales of her books, and that she cannot be bothered to get sensitivity readers or better editors for these things is so concerning.Another thing that was kind of unnecessary was this line:“A 2-year-old girl will have the same name even when she’s 22, Lily Bloom. Names aren’t something we eventually grow out of.”I understand the meaning behind this sentence, suggesting that parents should put thought into their children's names, and that it should suit an adult as much as a child. But I also understand that this can be seen as quite inconsiderate towards transgender people, and just people who change their names in general, because that's obviously possible too.There are just so many things that could have been easily avoided, and for these things to not be noticed and fixed is quite lazy of the author.Despite my problems with this book, I think the general idea that Colleen Hoover tried to present in this book was executed decently well at times, hence my two stars.This is a very difficult read, especially if you relate to any of it at all so please do check trigger warnings and be careful because it can be very uncomfortable to see yourself in someone like Lily, or in her position.

Many women who experience domestic abuse do not have the option to leave just because there is a better man out there and it’s also damaging to make it seem that Lily is simply picking between Ryle or Atlas.Moreover, this expands my discontent with howColleen chose to shove in aspects of her usual work to something so serious.A side love story was truly unnecessary for this, but I believe Colleen knew that if she wrote something without romance, it would not sell. Can I blame her for that? I’m not quite sure, but it certainly does not please me.Deriving from what I’ve mentioned so far, particularly about Ryle,it bothers me how little conclusion Colleen offers at the end of the book.I have had to have conversation after conversation with people who misinterpreted the book, who still forgive Ryle and who think of “It Ends With Us” as a romance book. For a while, my challenge question (for friend requests) was “What is your favourite (dark) romance book and why?” And I cannot tell you the number of times people answered with “It Ends With Us”. Some people write in their reviews that even though Ryle was not Lily’s ultimate partner and just because it “did not work out”, they will still have love for Ryle in their heart and think that he just needs help. And unfortunately, I don’t think these people are to blame.With Colleen still allowing Ryle to have custody, it almost allows for a small redemption for his character. And I believe at the end of the book, Colleen should have written one page with the cycle of abuse and how it was shown throughout the novel, and a conclusion expressing that if you love Ryle,you should not,because everything that he did, he did itconsciously and with purpose, through manipulation and guilt-tripping(weaponizing his trauma). I do appreciate however, that she included the domestic abuse hotlines.I also thinkit is unacceptable for people to be recommending this book as just a “sad book” or a “book to make you cry”, becausediminishing a book that explores such a difficult and serious topic like domestic abuse, to an object that simply serves the purpose of evoking emotions from you, is extremely disrespectful and shallow.Especially considering that this is such a personal book to Colleen Hoover.Another thing that I found to be really damaging about this book isthe audience.There is this#coquetteaesthetic on tiktok that I am sure you are aware of. I really to like the look of it etc. But it is a theme among this aesthetic to read books like \"It Ends With Us\" and \"Lolita\". I believe both of these texts are greatly misinterpreted, especially considering that it is often young girls who are reading these books from the ages of 11-15. Ignoring Lolita as that is a different topic,I am nearly certain that these girls buy books like “It Ends With Us” purely for the cover.It's pink. And it fits the aesthetic.I see people saying that they \"love\" “It Ends With Us” and I find it greatly concerning. What do you love about it? I see people ignoring Lily's plotline and just adoring Atlas and his whole \"I know it wasn't a pity fuck, Lily. I was there.\" They've transformed this as something to romanticise. Not to mention thatI also see girls giggle at what seems to be a little inside joke of theirs when they quote\"where did you get the magnet lily\"or\"you fell down the stairs\".I am really beginning to think that this book has done more harm than good.The writing wasn’t something I had a problem with.When I see people criticize Colleen Hoover, it tends to be becausethey call her writing “wattpad writing” which is stupid, because people will say that any contemporary romance has “wattpad writing”.That’s not a great criticism, they should actually elaborate. Other than the quotes that I’ve disagreed with like“There’s no such thing as a bad person, only people who do bad things”, I found that Colleen Hoover’s writing flows well and that she has some iconic, well thought out quotes.I wasn’t a huge fan of Lily writing her letters to Ellenand I didn’t really care at first, but in the Acknowledgement section of “It Ends With Us”, Colleen actually says thankyou to Ellen DeGeneres saying that she is“light when it comes to darkness”. Considering what an awful person everyone knows that Ellen is, I again struggle to understand why Colleen chose this specific detail when she could have chosen someone that was a much better person and influence. *I have been informed that because this book was written in 2016, Ellen was not known to be a bad person,although I still question Colleen's decision to make Lily write letters to a talk show host.Veering off that topic and coming back to my problems with Ryle, is thatI strongly despised how he cared for Lily when she was pregnant.I felt that Ryle cared more about the baby than Lily, and it continues to portray women as baby machines who are made to serve a purpose.The way he cared for her stomach and touched her stomach rather than her. It’s disgusting.Something that also boiled my blood isthe internal misogynythat I see Colleen weave into her books.Lily chooses to not decide whether to divorce Ryle or not until after she has the baby becauseshe believes that her decision would be affected by her hormones.What the fuck?????? Was the fact that he tried to rape you and then he beat you not clear enough?Furthermore, when Lily is trying to explain to Ryle that she wants to divorce him, she tells him something along the lines of“what if this baby girl came home to you and told you ‘daddy, this boy hits me but he apologized and said he wouldn’t do it again’, what if she came home with bruises”, and only then does that garner any sympathy from Ryle.This situation parallels the instances when men only feel remorse for things like sexual assault when they are told ‘what if it was your mother and sister’.It’s horrible and it made me deeply upset that I’ve seen reviews admiring how Ryle was “understanding” after Lily explained that to him.I believe Lily was a strong character to a degree and I agreed with the way she responded to certain things (or I would have done the same), but there are times where I would have been gone, and Lily stayed (like when Ryle begged her for sex). Still, you can really tell she did have a certain level of logic and reason, and tried to confront Ryle.Something that really bugged me was the characterDevinand how Colleen Hoover writes him asthegay stereotype.He's overly touchy with Lily, touching her breasts and pulling down her bra without her consent. This is truly such a disgusting and rude way to portray characters of the lgbtq+ community, especially considering that Colleen Hoover rarely diversifies her books(very few poc + lgbtq characters). It mainly frustrates me because Colleen Hoover clearly has a huge income from the sales of her books, and that she cannot be bothered to get sensitivity readers or better editors for these things is so concerning.Another thing that was kind of unnecessary was this line:“A 2-year-old girl will have the same name even when she’s 22, Lily Bloom. Names aren’t something we eventually grow out of.”I understand the meaning behind this sentence, suggesting that parents should put thought into their children's names, and that it should suit an adult as much as a child. But I also understand that this can be seen as quite inconsiderate towards transgender people, and just people who change their names in general, because that's obviously possible too.There are just so many things that could have been easily avoided, and for these things to not be noticed and fixed is quite lazy of the author.Despite my problems with this book, I think the general idea that Colleen Hoover tried to present in this book was executed decently well at times, hence my two stars.This is a very difficult read, especially if you relate to any of it at all so please do check trigger warnings and be careful because it can be very uncomfortable to see yourself in someone like Lily, or in her position.

            "Translation failed for: Not gonna lie, reading this poem felt, at times, like being punished in one of the lower Circles of Hell.Dante'sCommediais among those classics that I desperately want to *have read* but never actually *read*. AddWar and Peace,Don QuixoteandParadise Lostto that list of shame and procrastination. But sometimes, in rare moments, I feel like sucking it up, putting on my big girl pants, and facing the giant. Sometimes it goes right (see my stellar review forMoby Dick) and sometimes it goes terribly wrong (let's not talk about the clusterfuck that wasJane Eyre). Well,Inferno, surprisingly, fell somewhere in between.In September, I found a beautiful bind-up of theCommediafor an affordable price and decided to finally buy it. I planned on reading the entirety of the book in 2020 but after taking over two months to plough throughInferno, I knew that that wasn't going to happen. I needed to take my time.Infernobasically describes Dante's journey through Hell, as he is guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil (himself an inhabitant of Hell). It is followed up byPurgatorioandParadiso. Ultimately, the story can be seen as an allegory that represents the journey of the soul toward God.Now, I'm not religious at all and I'm also not interested in learning more about religions, whether that's Christianity or any other religion. I have nothing against people with firm beliefs but religious institutions have always rubbed me the wrong way. Nonetheless, I was able to engage withInfernovery openly. For me, it almost read like an absurd fantasy novel with great world building.My favorite part aboutInfernowas discovering how (!) Dante decided to structure his version of Hell. In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth. Toward the end of the poem, we learn that when Lucifer fell from Heaven, he fell directly into the center of the Earth (striking the Earth at the point which was later to be named Jerusalem), thereby making a huge hole through his impact that then became the physical space of Hell. The extra Earth mass shot upward (as it was repellent to Lucifer's form) and formed Mount Purgatorio, on the summit of which is the Garden of Eden.For me, it was very interesting to see which sins were punished in Hell andhow. When reading throughInferno, one cannot shake the feeling that the punishments are supposed to counter/ match the original sins. Apparently, there's a word for that:contrapasso, which means \"suffer the opposite\". By Dante's design, the punishment of the souls in Hell are supposed to resemble or contrast the sin itself. One of the more obvious examples of contrapasso occurs in the fourth Bolgia of the eighth circle of Hell, where the sorcerers, astrologers, and false prophets have their heads turned back on their bodies such that it is \"necessary to walk backward because they could not see ahead of them.\"I found that very clever because by use of contrapasso, Dante managed to make each circle of Hell unique and interesting, instead of having all of his souls being punished in the flames (I mean how boring would that have been?). Therefore, just as Dante, the reader is able to discover each corner of Hell anew.Sin inInfernois seen less as an offence against God than as a crime against humanity, in which the clarity of rational perception is fatally clouded or perverted. Therefore, the \"worst\" of sins, according to Dante's plan of Hell, is not lust or greed or avarice but rather treachery, which is punished at the very centre of Hell where Satan resides.InInferno, Satan is portrayed as a giant demon, frozen mid-breast in ice at the center of Hell. Satan has three faces and a pair of bat-like wings affixed under each chin. In his three mouths, he chews on Judas Iscariot, Marcus Brutus, and Gaius Cassius. Here again, we see contrapasso at work, as all three sinners are unable to move or speak, since their actions and words while they were own Earth were false, treacherous and full of lies. On top of that, the icy lake symbolises how they rejected God as well as their masters, so that they're now exempt from warmth (= God's light) forever.There are two reasons whyInferno, ultimately, was incredibly hard for me to get through and not an enjoyable read at all: first of all, I hated the translation that I was reading. In the foreword, it is stated that Dante is also impossible to translate and that translators (no matter of what language) are forced to make some very tough decisions. My translation (= I read this book in the Penguin Deluxe Classics edition, translated by Robin Kirkpatrick), as opposed to the Italian original, does not rely upon end rhyme ... which is a damn shame in hindsight because a lot of the poetic and lyrical nature of the poem was lost in that way. On top of that, certain choices for words seemed oddly out of place and overly modern, so that my reading flow was often unnecessarily interrupted. I really don't wanna sound dramatic but sometimes this translation was trulyunreadable. The language was so ugly and ordinary, and on top of that, it was still often hard to understand what was going on. Therefore, I had to constantly check in with secondary sources in order to not lose track of the story.Second of all, since I'm not knowledgeable on the religious and political figures that Dante chose to write about, a lot of the social commentary went right over my head. It wasn't shocking or juicy seeing Vanni Fucci, Branca D'Oria or Pietro della Vigna suffer in Hell. Why? Because I didn't know these people. I had no idea who they were and what they had done in their lives to warrant such treatment. Of course, at times, it was easy to grasp the shock value Dante'sInfernomust have had on contemporary readers when he placed certain well-known high-ranking political (e.g. Cleopatra, Alexander the Great, Attila or Brutus) or religious figures (e.g. certain Popes and bishops) in Hell. Nonetheless, it would be a lie to say I was entertained by that. I simply didn't care.And so all in all, I'm still glad that I finally read throughInfernobecause it is a work that has been referenced in literature throughout the centuries and on top of that, I really appreciate the effort Dante put into his architecture of Hell.

            "Translation failed for: From some of the reviews I've read, I was sure the writing was going to be atrocious. It's not. Sure there are times when it's repetitive and there's quite a few inconsistencies (where someone would say or do something and then contradict it a few pages later) and there were times when I had no idea what was going on (like where Ethan maybe almost had a heartache I guess and I thought it was some psychedelic love scene until it was explained at the end), but there are also moments of brilliance, in writing. The description was often vivid and I appreciate that it isn't uber-cheesy. I liked the Southern goth thing, especially Uncle Macon and Boo Radley and the changing house. In the beginning, I loved the setting of a Southern town and some of the quirky humor with which it was described. By halfway through though, I was sick of the over-stereotypical Southern town and over Garcia's and Stohl's mockery of it. I wish they hadn't wasted so much of the book making fun of the South.Some issues I had with the book:1. I didn't believe, not for one second, that Ethan was a guy. Forget a teenager (which I didn't see either), there was nothing masculine about him. I can appreciate the lack of male protagonists in YA fiction, but if you're female writing a guy, you better make him more male than a guy would. You can't make him distinguish the smell of rosemary and then go on for a page an a half about the dresses girls wear to dances and then all the decorations to the dance and make him overanalyze the behavior of the girl he likes. And you absolutely cannot make your protagonist disgusted that other guys appreciate a girl's body and want to distance yourself from such crude behavior. Whether you want to believe it or not, all guys notice those things, even the goody-goodies. Guys have this thing about being one of the guys and blending in. They don't like to stand out. And if they do (and if they're as well read as a college graduate who hangs out with his great aunts on the weekends), there is no way they would be popular. Even the way they described the way he packed away food sounded like the way girls are appalled that guys eat so much. The only way I could read Ethan was as a personification of the authors as a teenage boy with all their girliness. I know that doesn't make sense either, but it worked for me, except for those moments when I was surprised to remember Ethan was a guy. Sometimes he couldn't be anything but a girl.A few technicalities about guy things: Basketball. Centers aren't the stars of a basketball team. They don't get fouled every few second and they aren't the ones making the bulk of the shots. Garcia and Stohl could have meant regular baskets instead of fouls and mis-worded, but even then a center wouldn't be shooting from the free throw line. They're the big guys in the center who get shots off rebounds, not the ones dribbling up and down the court and making shots from the outside. And a guy who is on a sports team is ultra-dedicated to his team and the game and the season, especially if he's the star of the team. Guys don't let girls get between them and their game or their friends like girls do. Bands. This was worded vaguely, but I got the impression that Link, who is a drummer, was the main vocals in his band. Never going to happen. Lead singers are guitarist, bass players if you want, or just vocals, but not the guy in the back on the noisy drums setting the rhythm for the whole band. Like I said, it was vague and Link could have just been introducing the band, but I always wondered where the vocals were coming from when Ethan heard Sixteen Moons play on Lena's viola or anywhere that wasn't his iPod. Mysterious, supernatural vocals.2. I had trouble suspending my disbelief in this one. When it opens with Ethan waking from a recurring nightmare and his reaction is \"oh, there's mud on my bed again from my dream,\" it was a little jarring. I wanted him to freak out that his dreams were something more than dreams. I wanted him to freak out that someone could talk in his head. I wanted him to freak out that all these weird supernatural stuff was going on around him. (Not girl freak out, guy freak out.) And if he's getting mud and water in his bed, why isn't snoopy Amma, queen of the superstitious, who is up in the night way too often realizing something is going on while he sleeps? Nobody really noticed how crazy their small town got. I wanted a reason to belief that all this crazy supernatural phenomena had been going on in the world and nobody noticed before. It was too much. But my biggest issue with the supernatural elements is that I'm not a fan of black magic, not a fan of people with too much invincible power (especially power that is hidden but obvious), and more than anything, I'm not a fan of stories where people don't have a choice whether they're good or evil (our ability to chose is about the only thing we can control in our lives, without it, what are we but robotic extensions of someone else?). This book had all three, so while the suspense ended up being decent by the end (after a lot of dragging), I wasn't crazy about where it was going.Speaking of freedom of choice, I never felt that Ethan and Lena fell in love. It was this sense of \"oh, you're the girl from my dreams that I'm supposed to be madly in love with. You're hot; that's cool, let's be intensely, maddeningly in love beyond what mere mortals experience.\" Garcia and Stohl tried to backtrack with this sense that they were taking it slow and just being friends, but the damage had already been done. They had already fallen irrevocably and eternally in love solely because they were destined to without ever getting to know each other. And from then on, Ethan automatically understood everything Lena was thinking and feeling, which had nothing to do with the supernatural element. He just described her facial expressions or body language and told us exactly what was going on in her head. She may as well have been a secondary POV.3. Which brings me to my next issue, writing issues. There were several instances where the authors tried to take something back or add something that should have been happening as an afterthought or most annoying made Ethan play the stupid girl to keep the suspense going. This is most frustrating in the climax scene where it takes four pages after Ethan realizes something is off to figure out what the rest of us already have. I think we were supposed to be surprised by the revelation of who is waiting for them in the garden, but I don't see how you couldn't get it. And then Ethan makes this statement: \"She had the power to destroy. I had only seen the power to love.\" Really?Really?All those broken windows and storms and pandemonium and he hadn't noticed the power to destroy? What story was he in?Going into the climax, I was annoyed with the book and the characters who were just sitting around waiting for the climax. Before that, I kind of liked the book, but I got so frustrated with the stilting of Ethan and Lena's characters that I almost closed the book. If they don't care about their destiny, why should I? Time is running out and they have the book that maybe has the answers they're looking for and what do they do? They go to a dance (where Ethan describes the dresses and decorations). Pages and pages of a high school dance with doom waiting at the door. And then, they go to school and do homework and make out and take on the town and ignore the big clue given to them a hundred pages before the climax. We're later told that they spent so much time pouring over the book that they're sick of it, but other than the one scene, I didn't see it. Even if they didn't get any answers, I wanted to see Ethan and Lena in a panic trying to stop the inevitable, not waiting around for it to show up. And I'm not even going to go into the tantrum Lena pulls on the big day. The authors wanted certain scenes in so they forced them on the characters and the story when they didn't fit.I think the book was too long and the details focused on the wrong things. If it were an intense page-turner or the sexual tension powerful, then the 563 pages would have flown by. But it read like a book that was 563 pages. I can see why girls like the book, but not why anyone would give it 5 stars., error: From some of the reviews I've read, I was sure the writing was going to be atrocious. It's not. Sure there are times when it's repetitive and there's quite a few inconsistencies (where someone would say or do something and then contradict it a few pages later) and there were times when I had no idea what was going on (like where Ethan maybe almost had a heartache I guess and I thought it was some psychedelic love scene until it was explained at the end), but there are also moments of brilliance, in writing. The description was often vivid and I appreciate that it isn't uber-cheesy. I liked the Southern goth thing, especially Uncle Macon and Boo Radley and the changing house. In the beginning, I loved the setting of a Southern town and some of the quirky humor with which it was described. By halfway through though, I was sick of the over-stereotypical Southern town and over Garcia's and Stohl's mockery of it. I wish they hadn't wasted so much of the book making fun of the South.Some issues I had with the book:1. I didn't believe, not for one second, that Ethan was a guy. Forget a teenager (which I didn't see either), there was nothing masculine about him. I can appreciate the lack of male protagonists in YA fiction, but if you're female writing a guy, you better make him more male than a guy would. You can't make him distinguish the smell of rosemary and then go on for a page an a half about the dresses girls wear to dances and then all the decorations to the dance and make him overanalyze the behavior of the girl he likes. And you absolutely cannot make your protagonist disgusted that other guys appreciate a girl's body and want to distance yourself from such crude behavior. Whether you want to believe it or not, all guys notice those things, even the goody-goodies. Guys have this thing about being one of the guys and blending in. They don't like to stand out. And if they do (and if they're as well read as a college graduate who hangs out with his great aunts on the weekends), there is no way they would be popular. Even the way they described the way he packed away food sounded like the way girls are appalled that guys eat so much. The only way I could read Ethan was as a personification of the authors as a teenage boy with all their girliness. I know that doesn't make sense either, but it worked for me, except for those moments when I was surprised to remember Ethan was a guy. Sometimes he couldn't be anything but a girl.A few technicalities about guy things: Basketball. Centers aren't the stars of a basketball team.

            "Translation failed for: I probably had unreasonably high hopes for this book just because of its author.Maniac Mageewas my favorite book when I was a kid, and it remains my favorite preteen chapter book to this day. ButStargirldidn't move me the way that first taste of Jerry Spinelli's work did. In fact, I was so underwhelmed that I had little interest in finishing the book, but it was a fast enough read, so I stuck with it.The execution itself isn't bad. The character of Stargirl could easily have become a paper doll, one of those (usually female) characters who is so untouchable, so up-in-the-clouds perfect that she lacks any sort of dimension and can't be taken seriously. So, I'll give Spinelli that much--he conveys Stargirl's sincerity well. Additionally, she's deep. She has actual reasons for behaving the way she does, and they're actual, complex reasons that involve intelligence and creativity. I appreciated that she got enough floor time to actually explain her reasons for doing things, rather than just being a mysterious saint. Ultimately, though, Stargirl's earnestness can't disguise that she's just another Manic Pixie Dream Girl.I have to remind myself that most readers of this book will be young enough that they haven't been beaten to death with this tired trope in hundreds of romantic comedy/tragicomedy/dramedy-themed books and movies. Boy--who is nice enough, but a little inhibited, a little in need of some inspiration--meets outrageous, free-spirited, earthy girl who changes his life forever by teaching him to stop caring what other people think and be silly and reallylive, man. I swear, I thought to myself at the very beginning of the book, \"Any minute now, she'll be outside dancing in the rain,\" and then five pages later, she was outside dancing in the rain.Some of Stargirl's actions made me uncomfortable, too. I know she's supposed to be the shining, free-spirited light among all the dull, uninspired conformists in the high school drone factory, but just because she has good intentions behind her actions doesn't mean they are all necessarily good ideas. Stargirl goes to a lot of trouble to reach out to people, and she does it without asking for any kind of thanks, but having someone sing \"Happy Birthday\" to you in the middle of a crowded room or broadcasting your love for someone without talking to them first has always struck me as somewhat inconsiderate. Some people just don't want that kind of attention, and nothing is more traumatic for them than having all eyes in the room on them, completely without their consent. It's true that Stargirl is portrayed as completely innocent, and it's highly possible that she lacks the necessary social filters to understand why being serenaded with \"Happy Birthday\" isn't always a desired gift, but it made me less sympathetic toward her. It kind of reminded me of those guys who propose to their girlfriends on the Jumbotron at a sporting event--it's arrogant to assume that everyone else wants exactly what you want, and ultimately, regardless of your intentions, it makes the gesture about you, not the other person (while all eyes are on that person, obligating them to behave gracefully even if they're going to pieces inside).A more succinct way to summarize the last two paragraphs is this: the Stargirl character is inspiring but not original, and the heavy-handed message of Everyone Needs to Lighten Up and Be More Appreciative of Each Other is well-intentioned but shortsighted.Otherwise, the story was all right. Stargirl might lack social filters, but Leo behaves like a complete ass to her, resulting in the story's somewhat bitter ending. I think this was a fairly realistic portrayal--he cares too much about the approval of the many to show support for the one. And I did appreciate the story's lack of a sugary, upbeat ending in the name of resolution. I like a protagonist with regrets. Leo doesn't seem to have changed much--for all his obsessing over Stargirl after she leaves, one gets the impression that if he got a second chance, he would still care more about fitting in with the crowd than about treating her well--but at least he gets to spend the rest of his life wondering about the one he pushed away. (Even that falls into the MPDG, too-good-for-this-dull-world cliche. Of COURSE he has regret. She's gone, so she'll always be exactly as she was at sixteen and he can idolize her and righteously lament how perfect she was and how stupid he was.) But Stargirl doesn't deserve the shitty way everyone has treated her, and she is probably at her most realistically human when she changes herself out of desire for Leo's acceptance. Likewise, Leo is at his most realistically human when he embraces the \"new\" Stargirl, then rejects her when she stops conforming. The journey to maturity sucks.I'm probably taking this all way too seriously. The book was ok; I wasn't as wowed by it as most reviewers seem to have been; I should probably lighten up. But I've given my opinion., error: Prawdopodobnie miałam nieuzasadnione nadzieje co do tej książki tylko ze względu na jej autora. Maniac Magee była moją ulubioną książką, gdy byłam dzieckiem i do dziś pozostaje moją ulubioną książką dla nastolatków. Ale Stargirl nie poruszyła mnie tak, jak pierwsza próbka twórczości Jerry'ego Spinelliego. Właściwie byłam tak rozczarowana, że ​​nie miałam ochoty dokończyć książki, ale czytało się ją wystarczająco szybko, więc się jej trzymałam. Samo wykonanie nie jest złe. Postać Stargirl mogłaby z łatwością stać się papierową lalką, jedną z tych (zwykle kobiecych) postaci, które są tak nietykalne, tak wyobrażone, że brakuje jej jakiegokolwiek wymiaru i nie można jej brać na poważnie. Więc tyle przyznaję Spinelliemu — dobrze przekazuje szczerość Stargirl. Ponadto jest głęboka. Ma prawdziwe powody, dla których zachowuje się w taki sposób, a są to prawdziwe, złożone powody, które obejmują inteligencję i kreatywność. Doceniłem to, że dostała wystarczająco dużo czasu na podłodze, aby faktycznie wyjaśnić powody, dla których robi pewne rzeczy, zamiast po prostu być tajemniczą świętą. Ostatecznie jednak szczerość Stargirl nie może ukryć faktu, że jest po prostu kolejną Manic Pixie Dream Girl. Muszę sobie przypomnieć, że większość czytelników tej książki będzie wystarczająco młoda, aby nie zostali zmiażdżeni na śmierć tym oklepanym tropem w setkach książek i filmów o tematyce komedii romantycznej/tragikomedii/dramatu. Chłopak — który jest wystarczająco miły, ale trochę zahamowany, trochę potrzebujący inspiracji — spotyka oburzającą, wolną duchem, przyziemną dziewczynę, która zmienia jego życie na zawsze, ucząc go, aby przestał przejmować się tym, co myślą inni ludzie, był głupi i naprawdę żył, człowieku. Przysięgam, pomyślałem sobie na samym początku książki: „Za chwilę będzie tańczyć na zewnątrz w deszczu”, a pięć stron później była na zewnątrz i tańczyła w deszczu. Niektóre działania Stargirl również sprawiły, że poczułem się nieswojo. Wiem, że ma być jasnym, wolnym duchem wśród wszystkich nudnych, pozbawionych natchnienia konformistów w licealnej fabryce dronów, ale to, że ma dobre intencje, nie oznacza, że ​​wszystkie jej działania są koniecznie dobrymi pomysłami. Stargirl wkłada wiele wysiłku, aby dotrzeć do ludzi i robi to, nie prosząc o żadne podziękowania, ale to, że ktoś śpiewa ci „Sto lat” w środku zatłoczonego pokoju lub dajesz komuś znać, że go kochasz, nie rozmawiając z nim wcześniej, zawsze wydawało mi się nieco nietaktowne. Niektórzy ludzie po prostu nie chcą takiej uwagi i nic nie jest dla nich bardziej traumatyczne niż to, że wszystkie oczy w pokoju są zwrócone na nich, całkowicie bez ich zgody. To prawda, że ​​Stargirl jest przedstawiana jako całkowicie niewinna i jest wysoce prawdopodobne, że brakuje jej niezbędnych filtrów społecznych, aby zrozumieć, dlaczego bycie serenadą „Sto lat” nie zawsze jest pożądanym prezentem, ale sprawiło, że poczułam do niej mniej sympatii. Przypomniało mi to trochę facetów, którzy oświadczają się swoim dziewczynom na telebimie podczas wydarzenia sportowego — aroganckie jest zakładanie, że wszyscy chcą dokładnie tego samego, czego ty chcesz, a ostatecznie, niezależnie od twoich intencji, gest ten dotyczy ciebie, a nie drugiej osoby (podczas gdy wszystkie oczy są zwrócone na tę osobę, zmuszając ją do zachowywania się z wdziękiem, nawet jeśli w środku rozpada się na kawałki). Bardziej zwięzły sposób podsumowania ostatnich dwóch akapitów jest następujący: postać Stargirl jest inspirująca, ale nie oryginalna, a nachalny przekaz Everyone Needs to Lighten Up and Be More Appreciative of Each Other jest dobrze zamierzony, ale krótkowzroczny. Poza tym historia była w porządku. Stargirl może nie mieć filtrów społecznych, ale Leo zachowuje się wobec niej jak kompletny dupek, co skutkuje nieco gorzkim zakończeniem historii. Myślę, że to było dość realistyczne przedstawienie — zbyt bardzo zależy mu na aprobacie wielu, aby okazać wsparcie tej jednej osobie. I doceniłem brak słodkiego, optymistycznego zakończenia w imię rozwiązania. Lubię protagonistę z żalem. Leo nie wydaje się zbytnio zmieniać — pomimo całej jego obsesji na punkcie Stargirl po jej odejściu, można odnieść wrażenie, że gdyby dostał drugą szansę, nadal bardziej zależałoby mu na dopasowaniu się do tłumu niż na dobrym traktowaniu jej — ale przynajmniej może spędzić resztę życia rozmyślając o tej, którą odepchnął. (Nawet to wpisuje się w MPDG, zbyt dobra na ten nudny świat kliszy. OCZYWIŚCIE, że żałuje. Ona odeszła, więc zawsze będzie dokładnie taka sama, jak w wieku szesnastu lat, a on może ją ubóstwiać i słusznie lamentować nad tym, jaka była idealna, a jaki on głupi). Ale Stargirl nie zasługuje na gówniany sposób, w jaki wszyscy ją traktowali, i prawdopodobnie jest najbardziej realistycznie ludzka, kiedy zmienia się z pragnienia akceptacji Leo. Podobnie Leo jest najbardziej realistycznie ludzki, gdy obejmuje „nową” Stargirl, a następnie odrzuca ją, gdy przestaje się dostosowywać. Droga do dojrzałości jest do bani. Prawdopodobnie traktuję to wszystko zbyt poważnie. Książka była w porządku; nie byłam nią tak zachwycona, jak większość recenzentów; prawdopodobnie powinnam się rozluźnić. Ale wyraziłam swoją opinię. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: Eh?I have started readingThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Claywith certain expectations - if not great, then at least considerable. I have seen Chabon's name pop up on this site pretty often, reminding me of the fact that I have not yet read anything by him - this seemed like an obvious choice. At 634 pages it stands proudly as the author's magnum opus, and proved to be a critical darling by winning the Pulitzer in 2001. When you can, aim for the greats!So what's the big deal? The book has an engaging premise: it opens in Prague of 1939, where a Jewish teen named Josef Kavalier is fascinated by Harry Houdini and studying the art of escapology to prepare for the biggest trick of his life - flee the Nazi horror which slowly begins to surface in Czechoslovakia. After forming an ingenious plan and successfully carrying it out, Josef arrives in New York City to live with his cousin, Sammy Clay. Although things are awkward at first, the boys quickly hit it off when Sammy discovers Josef's artistic talent and lands him a job as an illustrator at Empire Novelty Company - Josef rebrands himself as \"Joe\" to sound more American. It's the Golden Age of Comic Books; after the enormous success ofSupermanthe company wants to jump on the bandwagon, and is willing to let both boys prove themselves. The Kavalier & Clay duo creates a new character,The Escapist- an anti-fascist superhero who can perform amazing feats of escapology to fight crime, with Sammy writing the stories and Joe illustrating them. AlthoughThe Escapistachieves immense popularity, the boys lives are not free from trouble and worry - with Joe frantically trying to get his family out of Prague and Sammy struggling with the question of his own identity.Chabon's love for the comic book is obvious: Joe's escape from Prague is a heroic attempt which could well find its place in a graphic novel - the theme of escapism is present throughout the book: Joe's literal escape from certain doom and later from his own demons, the character of the Escapist, escaping reality through reading, etc. Chabon's novel is a paean to comic books - set in their Golden Age, a period which has seen the rise of heroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America...Chabon's characters face the realities of publishing world at the time - they are mercilessly exploited by the publishers and shunned at by the reading public, as their work is seen as immature fun for children. The creation ofThe Escapistallows Chabon to have his character ponder what makes superheroes \"tick\", and their creative energy and joy of creation reflect the author's own enjoyment and love for the subject.The bad thing is that it overshadows almost everything else. There are so many fascinating topics in this book which are barely glossed over and given the most cursory treatment. Josef is a Czech Jew - but you would never guess that if it wasn't explicitly stated. Although the novel opens in Prague during the war, it could be set anywhere in eastern/central Europe - it's only set in Prague because Chabon wants to employ the local legend ofthe Prague Golemand incorporate it into his work as a clever way for his character to flee the country. The Czechs are wonderful people with a specific and unique culture and a long and interesting history, and their mountainous country is gorgeous (I had the pleasure of visiting it last year so my memories are especially fresh). I have read Czech and Slovak fairytales and fables when I was a boy. There's so much more to the country and the people than the legend of the golem - unfortunately, in this novel an entire nation has been reduced to background decoration for the opening act and discarded afterwards. After Joe's arrival in New York City, nothing more is made of his Czechness and he doesn't even experience any struggle with adaptation to the new country, typical for new immigrants - although he was not happy about leaving Prague for \"unimaginable Brooklyn\" he adapts to the U.S. literally overnight, and is ready for enormous success the next day - making the character look flat and lifeless.Last year I've read David Benioff's enormously entertaining book titledCity of Thieves(reviewedhere), set in Leningrad during the German occupation - the deadliest siege in history. Benioff's book has a great sense of place and is compulsively readable - he's a screenwriter by profession and he knows how to use tension and sustain pacing, and at the same time create memorable characters and an engaging narrative, holding true to an outlandish premise but not rendering the whole book flat. That's not the case here - Joe's escape is a small section at the beginning which ends almost immediately after it starts. Joe initially arrives in San Francisco from Japan - but the possibility of an adventure in imperial Japan (and Stalinist Russia before it - have to get to Japan somehow) is completely dropped, as if Chabon couldn't muster the energy to fully develop the possibility of his own creation.Anyone seeking an insightful work of fiction concerning World War 2, the Holocaust and antisemitism will also likely be disappointed. These characters seem to live in an America of complete religious tolerance - somewhat surprising in mid 20th century. as I felt as if the whole background of war was employed because it's abig subject, which is likely to appeal to readers and critics alike (not to mention theHolocaust). It feels exploitative; I was born in a city destroyed during the war and in a country which it damaged beyond repair. My primary school is located on the street named after a member of the underground resistance, who was caught by the Gestapo and put through extremely brutal and torturous interrogation - just a few streets away from where I'm typing these words. He was liberated after a brave attack on the car which was transporting him to prison, but died from injuries inflicted upon him by the Gestapo. People put flowers and light candles under memory plaques, and the streets fill with them - schoolchildren regularly do that to commemorate those murdered by the German soldiers. Joe Kavalier seems to be made a Jew and escape the Holocaust only to have a semblance of personality - after all, how could one call a Holocaust survivor dull?In 1943 Betty Smith wroteA Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which is also set in New York although a bit earlier - in the early 1910's. Smith's beautiful book did not win a Pulitzer - it did not win any awards - but remains a timeless classic and a timeless portrayal of the struggles faced by an immigrant family in the Brooklyn borough of Williamsburg. I doubt that any reader would be able to not care for Francie Nolan, the protagonist; Smith effortlessly paints a vivid and detailed picture of Brooklyn and its inhabitants with care and compassion as she herself grew up poor in Williamsburg, making Chabon's portrayal of New York look like a cheap imitation.The relationship between Joe and Sammy resembles the traditional relationship between the Hero and the Sidekick, and since Batman will always be cooler than Robin Sammy gets pushed into the background, and even when Kavalier is not on the stage he always plays the main role. And then there is....the fact that Sammy is gay - the struggle with his sexuality is so insignificant that it's barely noticeable, and comes out (get it? ha ha!) as tacked on as yet anotherbig subjectto cross of the list - New York? Check. Jewish characters? Check. World War 2? Check. The Holocaust? Check. What did we forgot? Aaaah, a gay character! Check.). It seemed to me that these characters were not done justice; the ideas of these characters are great, not so much the characters themselves. There's too much melodrama, and not enough depth. It's especially evident in the fact that they're contrasted against the even more unremarkable background characters, who move in and out without greater significance.It seems to me as if Michael Chabon wanted to have two worlds in this book: a real world and a comic book world, but didn't quite know how to mix them and achieve a compromise and resorted to an either-or: a real world (complete with footnotes) when it comes to comic books, the seriousness of being an artist and all the joys and frustrations that come with it, being trapped in a creative ghetto of a form looked down upon, but applied the comic-book simplified and generalized approach to almost everything else, concluding with a sudden and anti-climatic ending. It's almost as if the author's pen started running out of ink early into the project, and he had to dilute it with water - lots of water - to be able to continue to write: the resulting pages include sections which are sharp and clear and some which are almost transparently thin. The result if a short and readable would-be novel, which somehow became an overly long and often plodding book resembling an old circus performer, long out of practice: while it can still manage some entertaining stunts, in the end it loses balance and stumbles on its own legs, falls down and lands flat on the ground and doesn't really know what happened., error: Eh?I have started readingThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Claywith certain expectations - if not great, then at least considerable.

At 634 pages it stands proudly as the author's magnum opus, and proved to be a critical darling by winning the Pulitzer in 2001. When you can, aim for the greats!So what's the big deal? The book has an engaging premise: it opens in Prague of 1939, where a Jewish teen named Josef Kavalier is fascinated by Harry Houdini and studying the art of escapology to prepare for the biggest trick of his life - flee the Nazi horror which slowly begins to surface in Czechoslovakia. After forming an ingenious plan and successfully carrying it out, Josef arrives in New York City to live with his cousin, Sammy Clay. Although things are awkward at first, the boys quickly hit it off when Sammy discovers Josef's artistic talent and lands him a job as an illustrator at Empire Novelty Company - Josef rebrands himself as \"Joe\" to sound more American. It's the Golden Age of Comic Books; after the enormous success ofSupermanthe company wants to jump on the bandwagon, and is willing to let both boys prove themselves. The Kavalier & Clay duo creates a new character,The Escapist- an anti-fascist superhero who can perform amazing feats of escapology to fight crime, with Sammy writing the stories and Joe illustrating them. AlthoughThe Escapistachieves immense popularity, the boys lives are not free from trouble and worry - with Joe frantically trying to get his family out of Prague and Sammy struggling with the question of his own identity.Chabon's love for the comic book is obvious: Joe's escape from Prague is a heroic attempt which could well find its place in a graphic novel - the theme of escapism is present throughout the book: Joe's literal escape from certain doom and later from his own demons, the character of the Escapist, escaping reality through reading, etc. Chabon's novel is a paean to comic books - set in their Golden Age, a period which has seen the rise of heroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America...Chabon's characters face the realities of publishing world at the time - they are mercilessly exploited by the publishers and shunned at by the reading public, as their work is seen as immature fun for children. The creation ofThe Escapistallows Chabon to have his character ponder what makes superheroes \"tick\", and their creative energy and joy of creation reflect the author's own enjoyment and love for the subject.The bad thing is that it overshadows almost everything else. There are so many fascinating topics in this book which are barely glossed over and given the most cursory treatment. Josef is a Czech Jew - but you would never guess that if it wasn't explicitly stated. Although the novel opens in Prague during the war, it could be set anywhere in eastern/central Europe - it's only set in Prague because Chabon wants to employ the local legend ofthe Prague Golemand incorporate it into his work as a clever way for his character to flee the country. The Czechs are wonderful people with a specific and unique culture and a long and interesting history, and their mountainous country is gorgeous (I had the pleasure of visiting it last year so my memories are especially fresh). I have read Czech and Slovak fairytales and fables when I was a boy. There's so much more to the country and the people than the legend of the golem - unfortunately, in this novel an entire nation has been reduced to background decoration for the opening act and discarded afterwards. After Joe's arrival in New York City, nothing more is made of his Czechness and he doesn't even experience any struggle with adaptation to the new country, typical for new immigrants - although he was not happy about leaving Prague for \"unimaginable Brooklyn\" he adapts to the U.S. literally overnight, and is ready for enormous success the next day - making the character look flat and lifeless.Last year I've read David Benioff's enormously entertaining book titledCity of Thieves(reviewedhere), set in Leningrad during the German occupation - the deadliest siege in history. Benioff's book has a great sense of place and is compulsively readable - he's a screenwriter by profession and he knows how to use tension and sustain pacing, and at the same time create memorable characters and an engaging narrative, holding true to an outlandish premise but not rendering the whole book flat. That's not the case here - Joe's escape is a small section at the beginning which ends almost immediately after it starts. Joe initially arrives in San Francisco from Japan - but the possibility of an adventure in imperial Japan (and Stalinist Russia before it - have to get to Japan somehow) is completely dropped, as if Chabon couldn't muster the energy to fully develop the possibility of his own creation.Anyone seeking an insightful work of fiction concerning World War 2, the Holocaust and antisemitism will also likely be disappointed. These characters seem to live in an America of complete religious tolerance - somewhat surprising in mid 20th century. as I felt as if the whole background of war was employed because it's abig subject, which is likely to appeal to readers and critics alike (not to mention theHolocaust). It feels exploitative; I was born in a city destroyed during the war and in a country which it damaged beyond repair. My primary school is located on the street named after a member of the underground resistance, who was caught by the Gestapo and put through extremely brutal and torturous interrogation - just a few streets away from where I'm typing these words. He was liberated after a brave attack on the car which was transporting him to prison, but died from injuries inflicted upon him by the Gestapo. People put flowers and light candles under memory plaques, and the streets fill with them - schoolchildren regularly do that to commemorate those murdered by the German soldiers. Joe Kavalier seems to be made a Jew and escape the Holocaust only to have a semblance of personality - after all, how could one call a Holocaust survivor dull?In 1943 Betty Smith wroteA Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which is also set in New York although a bit earlier - in the early 1910's. Smith's beautiful book did not win a Pulitzer - it did not win any awards - but remains a timeless classic and a timeless portrayal of the struggles faced by an immigrant family in the Brooklyn borough of Williamsburg. I doubt that any reader would be able to not care for Francie Nolan, the protagonist; Smith effortlessly paints a vivid and detailed picture of Brooklyn and its inhabitants with care and compassion as she herself grew up poor in Williamsburg, making Chabon's portrayal of New York look like a cheap imitation.The relationship between Joe and Sammy resembles the traditional relationship between the Hero and the Sidekick, and since Batman will always be cooler than Robin Sammy gets pushed into the background, and even when Kavalier is not on the stage he always plays the main role. And then there is....the fact that Sammy is gay - the struggle with his sexuality is so insignificant that it's barely noticeable, and comes out (get it? ha ha!) as tacked on as yet anotherbig subjectto cross of the list - New York? Check. Jewish characters? Check. World War 2? Check. The Holocaust? Check. What did we forgot? Aaaah, a gay character! Check.). It seemed to me that these characters were not done justice; the ideas of these characters are great, not so much the characters themselves. There's too much melodrama, and not enough depth. It's especially evident in the fact that they're contrasted against the even more unremarkable background characters, who move in and out without greater significance.It seems to me as if Michael Chabon wanted to have two worlds in this book: a real world and a comic book world, but didn't quite know how to mix them and achieve a compromise and resorted to an either-or: a real world (complete with footnotes) when it comes to comic books, the seriousness of being an artist and all the joys and frustrations that come with it, being trapped in a creative ghetto of a form looked down upon, but applied the comic-book simplified and generalized approach to almost everything else, concluding with a sudden and anti-climatic ending. It's almost as if the author's pen started running out of ink early into the project, and he had to dilute it with water - lots of water - to be able to continue to write: the resulting pages include sections which are sharp and clear and some which are almost transparently thin. The result if a short and readable would-be novel, which somehow became an overly long and often plodding book resembling an old circus performer, long out of practice: while it can still manage some entertaining stunts, in the end it loses balance and stumbles on its own legs, falls down and lands flat on the ground and doesn't really know what happened. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY?This seems to be a real Marmite book (love it or loathe it, with no fence-sitting), so I'm going to mix my metaphors: I bit the bullet, to see which way the wind was blowing and was surprised to find myself sitting on the empty fence. I was very undecided about stars, but there are many much better books I've given 3*, so this gets 2*, even though there was, on reflection, more to it than I first thought. The quality of the writing is not sufficient for 3*.Overall, I think it’s poorly written (exacerbated by the way Donoghue tries to use unusual language for specific effect), but it is something of a page-turner, it’s quite a quick read (unless you overempathise, get depressed, and need a break) and it does contain some interesting ideas, especially in the second half about aspects of coping with “freedom” (though I am unsure how many are taken directly from news reports and interviews with former captives, and how many are her own).OVERVIEWThe situation is well-known: a twenty six year old woman, “Ma”, is living with her five year old son, Jack, in a tiny locked room. She has been there since she was abducted aged nineteen, and the story is narrated by Jack. They have daily visits from their captor, who brings meagre supplies, though they do have a TV and half a dozen books. Jack thinks reality is everything in their room, and that everything “in TV” is pretend.The first half of the book is set in Room (yes, with a capital letter and no article (“a” or “the”), like most of the few objects in their lives), and the second half is on the outside. It is clearly influenced by the recent news stories of Natasha Kampusch and Jaycee Lee Duggard etc, and that potentially prurient aspect did hold me back from reading this book for a long time. But I subsequently learned that Donoghue has said she was more influenced by the Fritzl case, which seems odd, because that was fundamentally different, as the abductor, imprisoner, and impregnator was the father of the young woman (more than one, initially).LANGUAGE AND WRITINGRight from the start, I found the narration annoying - not because it's by a 5-year old, but because he's such anunconvincing5-year old. For example, he has a very good vocabulary for his age (fair enough), and yet there are a few really basic words that he seems not to know (instead of \"a man\" or \"the woman\" he refers to \"a he\" and \"the she\" - except on one occasion when he unaccountably gets it right), and he often gets irregular past tenses and word order wrong, in the way that children younger than five often do (“I winned”, “we knowed”, “I brung”, “why you don’t like” and to a driver, “may you go us please to…”). Furthermore, he repeatedly makes these errors despite his mother's diligence in correcting his grammar and the fact he watches TV.It’s almost as if you can see Donoghue weighing up the need for Jack to be intelligent and insightful enough to tell the story in an engaging way (which, to a large extent, he does) with the need to tick certain boxes to make it clear he is just a small child. Similarly, we’re expected to believe that Jack points out “a dog crossing a road with a human on a rope” and thinks someone lighting up is trying to set himself on fire, even though he’s had TV and a mother who has tried to teach him about the (fictitious) world.The fact Jack is still breastfed is not surprising: it’s comforting for both of them. What is surprising though is that the word itself seems to be taboo (instead, he talks about “having some”, without ever saying what), and yet he’s happy to use the words “penis” and “vagina”, and is open about bathing with his mother. That may sound like nit-picking, but it’s an example of the sort of thing that frustrated me. I just didn’t feel Donoghue had really thought it through thoroughly. If you’re going to play with language to make your point, you need to be able to do so convincingly.PLOTThe book is in five sections, though really it falls more naturally into two: inside and outside.The relationship between mother and son is touching and the book opens by establishing the routines and rituals of their restricted life, including the almost liturgical way they say “good night” to all their (few) possessions: “Good night, Room… good night, Rug” etc. The creativity required to raise a child in a confined space with such limited resources are impressive, too (they blow their eggs, so the whole shells can be threaded to make a snake, and do PE using their limited furniture as gym props).Initially, and in some ways, their life doesn’t seem as bad as you might expect, and even the first appearance of their captor (“Old Nick”) is relatively benign. That reflects the way Ma is raising Jack in the most positive way she can. Of course, we know something of the real horrors of the story, and they are discussed, though never in graphic detail, in part because Jack’s comprehension is limited, and in part because of Ma's success in shielding him from the nature of the situation.I thought the escape was badly done, but much better is the when, leading up to it, Ma has to explain to Jack that what he’s seen “in TV” is real. They go through a confusing process of “unlying” as she tries to prepare him for what might follow an escape.Once outside, it’s superficially about the practicalities of adjusting to the real world, but really it’s questioning the nature and price of freedom. I found this part had more interesting ideas, but contained more implausibility of plot (though I’m no expert in such matters) and very flat new characters. In particular, the method and speed with which the police locate Room was absurd, and also some of the logistics, practicalities and oversights of those charged with their care and settlement on the outside were dodgy, such as the first planned trip for these traumatised celebrities being to a museum with an uncle whom Jack had only met once!WHAT IS FREEDOM?The reader roots for Ma and Jack to escape, and they do (no spoiler – the book blurb tells you). Hooray! But of course they soon discover a new form of captivity: medical/psychiatric, hiding from fame, and so on. And this is where it gets interesting and starts to feel more plausible. Jack’s only knowledge of outside is from occasional TV programmes, and Ma’s is from seven years ago, when she was a carefree student, rather than a traumatised mother. Jack has to discover the world, and Ma has to (re)discover a new version of herself; she tells Jack, “I know you need me to be your ma but I’m having to remember how to be me as well”, to which he replies, “But I thought the her and the Ma were the same”. Similarly, havingmore, can leave one feeling impoverished: Jack is puzzled when Ma cautions him to be careful of something her brother gave to her, “I didn’t know it was hers-not-mine. In Room everything was ours.”Some of the things they struggle to cope with are not ones that would initially have occurred to me (germs, sunburn, stairs), and one effect is to make it almost as if Jack has acquired Asperger’s syndrome: he can’t filter the multiple stimuli of a busy world; doesn’t understand social conventions, etiquette, and privacy; is confused by relationships and pronouns (“The ‘you’ means Ma, not me, I’m getting good at telling”); takes common idioms literally (such as “I’m afraid so” and “get his act together”, but surely some cropped up from Ma and TV?); doesn’t like being touched or having to wear shoes; is borderline agoraphobic; increases his counting-his-teeth stress-relieving tactic; is uncoordinated from poor spatial perception; and feels insecure without routine. Jack asks, “But what’s the rule?”, to which he is told “There is no rule.” That’s a liberating idea to Ma, but scary to Jack. He misses Room and his few possessions because it’s all he’d ever known; Ma, understandably, wants to leave it all behind both literally and in even from conversation and memory. When he has nightmares, the doctor says “Now you’re safe, it’s [the brain] gathering up all those scary thoughts you don’t need any more, and throwing them out”, but Jack disagrees, “actually he’s got it backwards. In Room I was safe and Outside is the scary.”Another aspect is how Ma’s family react. The girl they knew – and thought dead – has been replaced by someone similar, but different, and they have Jack to contend with. Ma loves him unconditionally, despite his parentage, but if you were her mother or father, how would you feel about this constant reminder of what happened?To sum up, this wasn’t as prurient as I feared, and it was very thought-provoking, but it could have been SO much better.THE FILMThe only occasions I've preferred a film to the original book are where I didn't enjoy the book. I'm told the film of this is excellent, especially the boy who plays Jack. A couple of friends, who knew my reasons for disliking this, have almost persuaded me to see it. I don't think I'll pay money to watch it in the cinema, but once it's on TV, I might.

Mare is sent off to become Silver royalty because she's special, but she doesn't have Silver blood. Which means a simple paper cut could expose her. First of all, Evangeline clearly wants to kill her, but prevents herself from cutting Mare multiple times because ~drama~ and ~suspense.~ But why do Elara and Tiberius want to keep her alive, anyway? Killing her would solve all their problems. It's not that hard to cover up her electric abilities afterwards. And then they betroth her to Maven, but why would they want a Red in a position of power? Of course, it's all a set-up at the end, but really? Mare fell for this? It's so blatantly obvious that Maven was lying. What would he have to gain, anyway? There are so many holes in this plot, and Mare either ignores them because of ✨love✨ or is too empty-headed to see them. This so-called Scarlet Guard trusts him blindly, giving him all their precious little secrets. It's so dumb. And then Elara is apparently a whisper, so she can look through people's thoughts. They somehow thought they would never be found (theybeingMare Barrow). Don't be an idiot. Oops, it's too late.I haven't seen any characters this bland since Kai, either. Cal and Maven are the same person, except one is less powerful and moody. Why is this a hard choice for Mare? Just kill them both, escape, pull a Kaz Brekker or whatever. Forget the stupid angsty princes and their stupid angsty declarations of fake love. Life's too short to waste it with men.My favorite character was Evangeline. Yes, the shallow mean girl who was only there to antagonize Mare. Because girl-on-girl hate is just SO COOL. I hope you detect my sarcasm. At least she knew what she was doing, unlike Bone Marrow (courtesy to whoever told me that joke, it was A+).And Horse Wheelbarrow must feel personally responsible for EVERY LITTLE THING, even if she didn't even cause it.I feel like a traitor. What are my parents eating for dinner tonight?Eat the stupid food. That's what it's there for.If it all goes to plan, he'll never hug his sister again.

I thought you hated these Silvers.\"Children.\" The words rip out of me. \"He's a father.Yeah, well, they're all fathers. They're all daughters/sons. They're all sisters/brothers. ??? What are you trying to say here? Everyone has family. Everyone is related to someone.just kill the guy alreadyMaybe he knew the colonel; maybe he was her brother, her cousin.Again with the personal responsibility! Obviously they're related to someone.And then there is Mare Barrow the Hypocrite, who hates all Silvers for being violent, heartless monsters and yet somehow expects them to treat Reds like more than glorified slaves. It works both ways, you know. Or, at least, it should.Cal's blood might be silver, but his heart is as black as burned skin.\"I can fault him for whatever I want,\" I snort, remembering the war books and death guides all over his room. \"He's just like all the others.\"As if this weren't enough, Mare's not-like-other-girls-ness is so overpoweringly annoying that it seeps into all the prose.\"You don't seem like the girl to weep at the drop of a hat.\"My stomach churns, but not with the excitement or nerves or any of the things silly girls talk about.Excuse me? Can I not be excited or nervous without being branded as a \"silly girl?\"Finally (I'm almost done), can we stop with this purple-prose-that's-just-weird trend that's going on in YA?The only things that serve to distinguish us, outwardly at least, is that Silvers stand tall. Our backs are bent by work and unanswered hope and the inevitable disappointment with our lot in life.Congratulations. You are officially On-Brand YA.My heart plummets in my chest until it bounces around my toes.What is this? Shatter Me?There's only one thing I did like--Queen Elara. She was a very compelling villain with layers, which surprised me in a book that was purely black-and-white. I sympathized with her (sometimes, at least more than I did with Horse).But, for the most part, this was the same old thing that's been churning out of the YA Machines since the year 2000.1.5 starsBuddy read withmy bestest buddy.

But there is another boy within the corrupt government who is not like other boys....Do you see? *awkward silence* *someone in the audience coughs* WE HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED.The rest of this review is riddled with spoilers, so stop here if you haven't read the book or if you just don't care.This book makes no sense at all. Mare is sent off to become Silver royalty because she's special, but she doesn't have Silver blood. Which means a simple paper cut could expose her. First of all, Evangeline clearly wants to kill her, but prevents herself from cutting Mare multiple times because ~drama~ and ~suspense.~ But why do Elara and Tiberius want to keep her alive, anyway? Killing her would solve all their problems. It's not that hard to cover up her electric abilities afterwards. And then they betroth her to Maven, but why would they want a Red in a position of power? Of course, it's all a set-up at the end, but really? Mare fell for this? It's so blatantly obvious that Maven was lying. What would he have to gain, anyway? There are so many holes in this plot, and Mare either ignores them because of ✨love✨ or is too empty-headed to see them. This so-called Scarlet Guard trusts him blindly, giving him all their precious little secrets. It's so dumb. And then Elara is apparently a whisper, so she can look through people's thoughts. They somehow thought they would never be found (theybeingMare Barrow). Don't be an idiot. Oops, it's too late.I haven't seen any characters this bland since Kai, either. Cal and Maven are the same person, except one is less powerful and moody. Why is this a hard choice for Mare? Just kill them both, escape, pull a Kaz Brekker or whatever. Forget the stupid angsty princes and their stupid angsty declarations of fake love. Life's too short to waste it with men.My favorite character was Evangeline. Yes, the shallow mean girl who was only there to antagonize Mare. Because girl-on-girl hate is just SO COOL. I hope you detect my sarcasm. At least she knew what she was doing, unlike Bone Marrow (courtesy to whoever told me that joke, it was A+).And Horse Wheelbarrow must feel personally responsible for EVERY LITTLE THING, even if she didn't even cause it.I feel like a traitor. What are my parents eating for dinner tonight?Eat the stupid food. That's what it's there for.If it all goes to plan, he'll never hug his sister again. Evangeline will have lost a brother.Oh, be quiet. People have siblings, okay? They don't matter.He's a father. He's a father and we're going to kill him.Just kill him already. I thought you hated these Silvers.\"Children.\" The words rip out of me. \"He's a father.Yeah, well, they're all fathers. They're all daughters/sons. They're all sisters/brothers. ??? What are you trying to say here? Everyone has family. Everyone is related to someone.just kill the guy alreadyMaybe he knew the colonel; maybe he was her brother, her cousin.Again with the personal responsibility! Obviously they're related to someone.And then there is Mare Barrow the Hypocrite, who hates all Silvers for being violent, heartless monsters and yet somehow expects them to treat Reds like more than glorified slaves. It works both ways, you know. Or, at least, it should.Cal's blood might be silver, but his heart is as black as burned skin.\"I can fault him for whatever I want,\" I snort, remembering the war books and death guides all over his room. \"He's just like all the others.\"As if this weren't enough, Mare's not-like-other-girls-ness is so overpoweringly annoying that it seeps into all the prose.\"You don't seem like the girl to weep at the drop of a hat.\"My stomach churns, but not with the excitement or nerves or any of the things silly girls talk about.Excuse me? Can I not be excited or nervous without being branded as a \"silly girl?\"Finally (I'm almost done), can we stop with this purple-prose-that's-just-weird trend that's going on in YA?The only things that serve to distinguish us, outwardly at least, is that Silvers stand tall. Our backs are bent by work and unanswered hope and the inevitable disappointment with our lot in life.Congratulations. You are officially On-Brand YA.My heart plummets in my chest until it bounces around my toes.What is this? Shatter Me?There's only one thing I did like--Queen Elara. She was a very compelling villain with layers, which surprised me in a book that was purely black-and-white. I sympathized with her (sometimes, at least more than I did with Horse).But, for the most part, this was the same old thing that's been churning out of the YA Machines since the year 2000.1.5 starsBuddy read withmy bestest buddy.

            "Translation failed for: This book was an experiment, and while there were moments that were clever and compelling and emotionally resonant, as a whole, the experiment failed. That experiment was to take a piece of complex, religious poetry intended for adults (Paradise Lost), turn it on its head, and make it into an anti-religion/coming-of-age allegory for children. Even though Pullman ultimately failed to create a believable, subtle, or controlled narrative universe, evenThe Amber Spyglassdid have its good moments.Pullman's writing is still as vivid and engaging as it was in the first two books, and he has a good sense of how to write exciting and suspenseful action scenes. He has a knack for describing landscapes richly (he tends to describe landscapes and nature a bit more than I care for, but that's just my personal preference as a reader), and he has a passion and respect for curiosity that I find admirable. The overall message of the series, as bluntly and childishly as it was delivered, is still a worthwhile and important message to build a book around: to approach the world with vigor and curiosity, to keep an open mind, to do no harm, and to seek the truth no matter how frightening it may be to do so. His vision and goals as an author are praiseworthy, and his skill with language is something that other children's authors can emulate.However, Pullman fails one very important test of novel-writing: his characters are flat. Try as I might, I simply did not care about most of the characters in the story. Lyra was basically a broken record that said things like \"I been thinkin'...let's save them!'\" and \"Let's do the right thing!\" and \"Oh, I got to do this, I got to!\" and \"I ain't the smartest, but by golly am I brave!\" She sounded like a character from Winnie-the-Pooh. \"Let's go lay down by the brambly bush and have some refreshment while we talk about what an ever so exciting and gay time we've had today, making new friends and learning a moral lesson here and there about doing The Right Thing!\" That's not even taking into account the fact that she was a pig-headed brat throughout ¾ of the entire series. It wasn't until a flood of estrogen poured into her system when she spontaneously hit puberty that she finally stopped stamping her foot and listening seriously to the advice and wisdom that adults had to offer.Sure, she and Will were brave and strong and self-sacrificing. But neither of them really developed into anything beyond Pullman's simplistic notion of golden-hearted goodness. Despite all the fuss Pullman made about Lyra being \"tempted,\" she was never really tempted at all. She never had to face a real moral choice about right and wrong: she always knew, with absolute certainty, what was right and what was wrong. Her personality was cloying and saccharine when she wasn't being abrasive and stubborn, and I couldn't stand her. Will was a bit better, but even he failed to live up to my expectations of character development. And if those two – the main characters – weren't adequately developed, who else in the seriescouldbe? One of the only characters who came anywhere near being interesting and unpredictable was Mrs. Coulter, who was basically a Snape figure, but less plausible and not as much fun to read about. Dr. Malone also had her moments as a developed character, but unfortunately she only made up a small part of the series as a whole.Mrs. Coulter was interesting, but ultimately, no one was able to give a satisfactory reason to explain her change of heart. Maybe she still had the hots for Asriel, maybe her maternal instinct kicked in 12 years too late, maybe she genuinely thought Lyra was a good kid...or maybe Pullman just needed to create a series where the main character's mother loved her and was willing to stretch the reader's suspension of disbelief as much as he needed to in order to get there. Mrs. Coulter claimed to love Lyra, but she never had a real, honest conversation with her, never respected her rights, never apologized to her (and apologies are oh so very important in this series, because it's The Right Thing To Do), never had any real reason to change her mind about Lyra other than the fact that Lyra turned out to be \"special.\" Throughout the whole book, the reader is wondering whether Mrs. Coulter is a double agent, or a triple agent, or just a plain wacked-out, twisted evil woman who works for herself and no one else. And in the end, even though she nobly sacrifices herself to bring about something or other good, I never really felt convinced of her goodness because there was no solid rationale for it. It just felt like Pullman pulling the puppet-strings and saying, \"You're a good mother now!\" Asriel, on the other hand, is never redeemed, as far as I'm concerned, not even through author-intervention. He's still as ruthless, pitiless, cold, and calculating as he was from the very beginning – so how are we supposed to root for Asriel's side when both he and Mrs. Coulter are no better than the enemy they're fighting?Pullman was also bad at giving satisfying justifications for his other characters' motives. In this book, Lyra suddenly comes up with the idea that she wants to visit the Land of the Dead. Why didn't she think of this in the second book? Why haven't we heard more about her guilt if it really has been eating her up all this time? Why is an apology worth more than four people's lives? Why is there a Land of the Dead at all, since we've heard nothing about it until now and it doesn't really fit with the whole, you know, atheism thing? The more perilous and ridiculous the journey to the Land of the Dead seems, and the more people warn Lyra about the dangers of going there, the more stubborn she becomes. Will has an equally pathetic reason for wanting to visit his father. To do what? How can you possibly establish a connection with the ghost of a person you didn't know well even when they were alive? The entire enterprise of going to the Land of the Dead seemed to be Pullman's way of engineering an \"end to death,\" because it fits with the whole disobeying-God theme inParadise Lost. When I realized that Pullman was going to stick with the allegory even if it didn't make sense within the world he had created, I couldn't help but lose a lot of respect for the book.Why was it forbidden for Will to think of his mother, which would distract him from his mission, but it was ok for Lyra to obssess about Roger and drag herself and others into peril just to assuage her own guilt? There never was a good reason given for why Will had to forget all about his mother in order to keep the knife intact, but Lyra's obsession with Roger was allowed to be a major driving force in the narrative. Is Roger more important than Will's mother? Certainly not from my perspective. Roger is even more flat than Will and Lyra as far as characters go. He wasn't even interesting when he was alive – why should I care about him now that he's dead? Because Roger was dead (which itself served no other purpose than to make Asriel look like a jerk), and because Pullman needed to force the characters to go to the Land of the Dead, he played up Lyra's part in Roger's death and tried to convince the reader that Roger was actually quite important, and ever so helpful and good and true. I got extremely tired of the whole \"Huzzah, let's rescue him!\" mentality of the characters. It's the same old epic, unrealistically high stakes, the same old Characters of Destiny who must fulfill a prophecy of some kind in order to save the world.Which brings me to my annoyance with the end of the book. Pullman pulled out all the stops on this one. Will and Lyra are experiencing \"true love,\" no matter that they're onlytwelve years oldand have known each other for a few months! Did I mention that they'retwelve years old? I balked at the dramatic and maudlin ending because I could not get over the fact that these were pre-teens in the most exaggerated throes of hormone-driven passion and Pullman wanted us to take this seriously, wanted us to believe this was \"true love.\" Maybe my cynicism about the ending is just a symptom of the fact that I'm older than the target audience for this book. Still, there is clearly a subtext to the series that Pullman put in there for the benefit of adults. Why would he insult his adult readers by holding up this extremely young, inexperienced, twelve-year-old couple as the paragon of romantic love?From a logistical point of view, it doesn't even seem plausible that Will and Lyra had to be separated at all. Pullman wanted a tragic, \"coming-of-age\" ending, so he invented plot hooks to get there. The fact is, if there's enough wonder and curiosity and open-mindedness and kindness in the world to keep one window open, then surely there's enough to keep two open. I'm not convinced that things would be just fine with a giant window open for the rest of time to let hordes of the dead escape, but the universe would erupt into nothingness if a small, person-sized hole was left open for the next 60 years or so, just until Will and Lyra died and no longer needed it. Pullman dangled out the possibility of a happy ending, but then, for a completely arbitrary and author-generated reason, he shut down that possibility so that Will and Lyra could \"grow up\" or \"lose their innocence\" or some other platitude. I understand that being separated from each other was Pullman's way of representing their exile from Paradise, but again, this is another case where he's letting the allegory dictate how the story will turn out rather than directing and crafting his own story according to what makes the most sense.Oh, and for the record: nobody kills God in this book. Rather than railing against this book for the supposed death of God, why don't people instead rail against this book for being bad?, error: This book was an experiment, and while there were moments that were clever and compelling and emotionally resonant, as a whole, the experiment failed. That experiment was to take a piece of complex, religious poetry intended for adults (Paradise Lost), turn it on its head, and make it into an anti-religion/coming-of-age allegory for children.

I balked at the dramatic and maudlin ending because I could not get over the fact that these were pre-teens in the most exaggerated throes of hormone-driven passion and Pullman wanted us to take this seriously, wanted us to believe this was \"true love.\" Maybe my cynicism about the ending is just a symptom of the fact that I'm older than the target audience for this book. Still, there is clearly a subtext to the series that Pullman put in there for the benefit of adults. Why would he insult his adult readers by holding up this extremely young, inexperienced, twelve-year-old couple as the paragon of romantic love?From a logistical point of view, it doesn't even seem plausible that Will and Lyra had to be separated at all. Pullman wanted a tragic, \"coming-of-age\" ending, so he invented plot hooks to get there. The fact is, if there's enough wonder and curiosity and open-mindedness and kindness in the world to keep one window open, then surely there's enough to keep two open. I'm not convinced that things would be just fine with a giant window open for the rest of time to let hordes of the dead escape, but the universe would erupt into nothingness if a small, person-sized hole was left open for the next 60 years or so, just until Will and Lyra died and no longer needed it. Pullman dangled out the possibility of a happy ending, but then, for a completely arbitrary and author-generated reason, he shut down that possibility so that Will and Lyra could \"grow up\" or \"lose their innocence\" or some other platitude. I understand that being separated from each other was Pullman's way of representing their exile from Paradise, but again, this is another case where he's letting the allegory dictate how the story will turn out rather than directing and crafting his own story according to what makes the most sense.Oh, and for the record: nobody kills God in this book.

Being romantic is to experience living in the present state, whereas being rational or classical is to connect the past to the future and thus continue to accumulate the collective wisdom and knowledge down through the generations.Through this analogy we are supposed to appreciate both the emotional and logical modes of our life experience, and obtain a sense of how the two interact and reinforce one another.

If I am simply a normal reader thinking this, then who the hell was working as the editor?? Did they not bring up these issues? Clearly the several people the author listed in his acknowledgements couldn't have been reading closely enough. The text was just screaming \"amateur writer, please help.\"What surprises me is that the author's background is in film. Being that I myself have a background in film, I can tell you that the one thing that is stressed is making conclusive ideas. Do not bring up something that has no relevance to the rest of the story (because obviously in film, every second is costly, whereas of course in Microsoft Word there is so consequence to typing more characters.) What bothered me most was that the author seemed unaware about how to properly use the gimmick of his entire book: the old photographs, some photoshopped, some vintage original, to illustrate the world. He used several of these pictures simply to use them, and I find out later that they in fact contribute nothing to the story.That's right. There's no reason at all for them to be there.Often it seems the author was thinking \"oh that's a cool picture, let's throw it in,\" when in fact there's no connection that it's in there, besides the narrator finding the picture. Here I'm speaking of the several pictures of Peculiars that we never meet, the clown twins (who we have TWO different photographs of at different times in the book, as if they have significance), the dog headed boy, the girl in the jar, the girl with the reflection....I could go on. Why include these photographs if they are not involved in your story? You may think they look cool, author, but it weakens your story when you make no mention of them in your story after you show their pictures. At least make up some sort of subplot about how they've been disappearing or leaving, as to why you've brought up characters simply for putting in pictures. The author states at the end of the book there are only ten children, so it's not like they're there and just not talking. So if there are only ten children, then the fact that all these pictures in there of much more than ten children makes it confusing and annoying. The lack of cohesion was just destroying my brain.Another thing that weakened the picture gimmick is that the multiple pictures of Emma were clearly different people and it bothered me that the author pretended that wasn't noticeable. The first picture of Emma was more about age 10/11 looking, and the fact that her age, or a description to indicate she's more mature, isn't stated til two chapters after we see that picture completely derailed me and what the mental picture of her was supposed to be. Then the comparison of the picture of potato peeling Emma with the last picture of Emma were not possibly believable as being the same person. I may sound picky, but if your book is centered around this idea, then make your concept strong! Horace as well, the two pictures we have of Horace aren't possibly the same person, and again, an issue with using about a 9 year old kid for his first picture and then a 17 year old boy's picture for the next. Consistency is important, and if he cared I felt he would have dug deeper into finding better photos for his characters instead of just saying \"oh this might work.\" (And I'm not sure which ones were photoshopped and which ones weren't, but the perspective of Victor's bed in the mirror of that one picture is absolutely impossible, and it bothered me to no end looking at it)Aside from the fact that the entire book felt like it was created simply to show some 'cool vintage photos,' I felt that the author didn't have a full grip on his own ideas. He had good ideas, as complicated as they are. Nice settings, I enjoyed some of the scenes, like the glowfish, and Enoch's big moment, but the writing itself was rather weak. The thing that bothered me quite a lot for the first 2/3 of the book is that the reader is too smart for the book. This book is clearly meant for older teens, due to the language I couldn't say it's for anybody younger, and I know older teens are clearly capable of putting together the information presented and figuring out what's going on. However the narrator does not, and the reader ends up waiting several more pages each time for the narrator to figure it out and then state importantly that he's figured out what's going on as if it's a revelation when we've been waiting for the obvious for a while. Luckily though, at the end there were at least some things I did not see coming, which felt a bit better. However writing-wise I also found some general writing 'don'ts' that screamed out at me, like lack of pronoun clarification, use of cliche phrases (\"face the music\"), and using the same phrase over and over in only a few pages time (\"torn to pieces\").Additionally, the side story about Marcie (the one with the photo of the girl crouching waiting for the school bus) clearly showed me that the author didn't have a good idea of his own concept. I don't want to spoil the basic premise of how the world works, but if you think about it there's no way she could have been that age waiting for a school bus if you applied the rules of the world to her.And lastly, the way the book ended....is there supposed to be a followup book? I didn't believe so, but it's so unfinished I'm not sure. Perhaps he was going for a bit of both, like 'if this book does well I'll write another, but if not it doesn't matter.' I understand the reasoning of why it ended how it does: because of the way things turned out, the narrator is now in charge and has plenty of things to do with his life. But there's no conclusion whatsoever. The questions that such openness leaves hanging in the air just adds to the already mounting stack of issues with weak writing.Overall, the book had some good ideas, and the gimmick with the photos would have been nice, however the ideas aren't fully formed. With lots of editing and reinforcement of concept, this could have been a good book. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the people working with him on this book didn't bring up or didn't force the author to take a longer look at his numerous weak points, we end up with a book that feels flattened by the author's inability to form and communicate ideas effectively.This book is, sadly, a mess., error: I can't even.The poor execution of a good idea is just so upsetting to me.The main problem with this book is that the entire time I was reading I felt like a high school English teacher grading a student's paper, when in fact I am not a teacher or anyone who majored in English or writing.

            "Translation failed for: It doesn’t happen often, but from time to time after I finish a work of literature, I wonder, “What just happened?” In an effort to answer that question, my brain attempts to turn itself inside out to make sense of it all. This time that torture came from Rushdie’s Midnight Children. This novel is my first experience reading Rushdie’s work, so I am not sure if the writing style of this book is typical of the author, but I am not in any hurry to find out.Being an English Literature student and an avid reader, I felt a certain expectation of myself to admire Rushdie and his work. After all, he is a very celebrated author, and his books appear on many “must read” lists compiled by authors I respect. After the first 250 pages of Midnight’s Children I felt self-conscious that I that I didn’t like the book, in fact, I was beginning to despise it.I consider Midnight’s Children a triple dog dare from Rushdie to read his book to the very end. As with most dares, it was daunting to face, and to test my resolve, he made every attempt to make me put down the book for good. The fact that I see all dares through, from eating worms to kissing a friend’s younger brother, and that Midnight’s Children was a class assigned book, were the only motivations that I had not to. Within the more than six-hundred pages of text, there are about one hundred pages of straight forward biography written by the protagonist Saleem Sinai, and Rushdie makes you work very hard to find them hidden among the overwhelming quantity of details, a task I found tedious, frustrating and at times mind numbingly boring.I simultaneously pitied and despised Saleem. Like the other 1,000 children born at the stroke of midnight of India’s independence, Saleem has special powers, the telepathic ability to communicate with all of these children. Despite his gift, he is not particularly respected among the children for very long. His average life is also not spectacular. He is not handsome or physically co-coordinated. He is bullied by children and adults, often betrayed and physically mutilated, and so emotionally sensitive he seeks comfort by surrounding himself with dirty laundry. However, this same Saleem that my heart went out to was the one writing the story that was torturing me page after page after page.Rushdie does provide the reader with a representative in the plot, Padma. She is the novel’s saving grace, the one person who is able to stop Saleem’s self important dialogue. She is frustrated with the slow moving pace of the narrative and gives voice to the like minded reader when she urges Saleem to write more concisely and get to the point faster. At first I found Padma’s sudden entries into the plot distracting, but after awhile I found myself peeking ahead in order to see when she would appear again to gauge exactly how much longer I had to continue reading before respite.I confess I am very ignorant of the events surrounding the formation of Pakistan, the independence of India, and the decades of war and political maneuvering between them. I didn’t even make it through the entire movie “Gandhi”. At first I welcomed the history lesson Rushdie provides of those times. However, by the middle of Book II, I found the sheer volume of details confusing and obtuse, and was skimming over these parts. By the end of Book II, I was skipping them altogether. In the chapter “How Saleem Achieved Purity”, I felt vindicated of my behavior. Saleem’s description of the events that led to the demise of his family in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 starts with, “Which facts to present?” and continues with pages of questions and conjecture, “Did it happen this way or didn’t it?” The seemingly endless expansion on his proposed questions finally raised my own: “I don’t know exactly how it happened, I don’t care, and can you please get to the point?!”Rushdie misses, or maybe ignores the perfect opportunity to end his story. With the final dispersal of Midnight’s Children after their captivity by the government, most of the loose ends are tied up, or the reader has learned enough essential plot elements to forgive Rushdie if he ended Saleem’s story this way. To me, I felt the last forty pages were Rushdie’s last challenge to me to complete his dare: would I or could I read through these superfluous pages of obvious revelations or would I finally quit. The sense of power and freedom I felt after reading the very last sentence was made sweeter by my accomplishment.To be fair to Rushdie, objectively, his writing skills are incredible. His ability to tie Saleem’s life to history and his ability to overlap events, religions, and mysticism is something for some to aspire to. His overwhelming details created vivid images: beautiful Kashmirian landscapes, putrid slums and titillating, (almost) love scenes. His skills in these areas might be enough for some people to excuse the tedium of Midnight’s Children, but for me it didn’t. By the end of the novel, I didn’t even feel bad that I didn’t like Rushdie’s writing, or this novel., error: It doesn’t happen often, but from time to time after I finish a work of literature, I wonder, “What just happened?” In an effort to answer that question, my brain attempts to turn itself inside out to make sense of it all. This time that torture came from Rushdie’s Midnight Children. This novel is my first experience reading Rushdie’s work, so I am not sure if the writing style of this book is typical of the author, but I am not in any hurry to find out.Being an English Literature student and an avid reader, I felt a certain expectation of myself to admire Rushdie and his work. After all, he is a very celebrated author, and his books appear on many “must read” lists compiled by authors I respect. After the first 250 pages of Midnight’s Children I felt self-conscious that I that I didn’t like the book, in fact, I was beginning to despise it.I consider Midnight’s Children a triple dog dare from Rushdie to read his book to the very end. As with most dares, it was daunting to face, and to test my resolve, he made every attempt to make me put down the book for good. The fact that I see all dares through, from eating worms to kissing a friend’s younger brother, and that Midnight’s Children was a class assigned book, were the only motivations that I had not to. Within the more than six-hundred pages of text, there are about one hundred pages of straight forward biography written by the protagonist Saleem Sinai, and Rushdie makes you work very hard to find them hidden among the overwhelming quantity of details, a task I found tedious, frustrating and at times mind numbingly boring.I simultaneously pitied and despised Saleem. Like the other 1,000 children born at the stroke of midnight of India’s independence, Saleem has special powers, the telepathic ability to communicate with all of these children. Despite his gift, he is not particularly respected among the children for very long. His average life is also not spectacular. He is not handsome or physically co-coordinated. He is bullied by children and adults, often betrayed and physically mutilated, and so emotionally sensitive he seeks comfort by surrounding himself with dirty laundry. However, this same Saleem that my heart went out to was the one writing the story that was torturing me page after page after page.Rushdie does provide the reader with a representative in the plot, Padma. She is the novel’s saving grace, the one person who is able to stop Saleem’s self important dialogue. She is frustrated with the slow moving pace of the narrative and gives voice to the like minded reader when she urges Saleem to write more concisely and get to the point faster. At first I found Padma’s sudden entries into the plot distracting, but after awhile I found myself peeking ahead in order to see when she would appear again to gauge exactly how much longer I had to continue reading before respite.I confess I am very ignorant of the events surrounding the formation of Pakistan, the independence of India, and the decades of war and political maneuvering between them. I didn’t even make it through the entire movie “Gandhi”. At first I welcomed the history lesson Rushdie provides of those times. However, by the middle of Book II, I found the sheer volume of details confusing and obtuse, and was skimming over these parts. By the end of Book II, I was skipping them altogether. In the chapter “How Saleem Achieved Purity”, I felt vindicated of my behavior. Saleem’s description of the events that led to the demise of his family in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965 starts with, “Which facts to present?” and continues with pages of questions and conjecture, “Did it happen this way or didn’t it?” The seemingly endless expansion on his proposed questions finally raised my own: “I don’t know exactly how it happened, I don’t care, and can you please get to the point?!”Rushdie misses, or maybe ignores the perfect opportunity to end his story. With the final dispersal of Midnight’s Children after their captivity by the government, most of the loose ends are tied up, or the reader has learned enough essential plot elements to forgive Rushdie if he ended Saleem’s story this way. To me, I felt the last forty pages were Rushdie’s last challenge to me to complete his dare: would I or could I read through these superfluous pages of obvious revelations or would I finally quit. The sense of power and freedom I felt after reading the very last sentence was made sweeter by my accomplishment.To be fair to Rushdie, objectively, his writing skills are incredible.

            "Translation failed for: Have you ever finished a book and thought \"Man, this is going to be hard to review?\" Because that's the first thing I thought when I finished this little book by Laura Esquivel. Like Water for Chocolate: A Novel in Monthly Installments With Recipes, Romances, and Home Remedies is a book that really left me conflicted. There were things about it that I absolutely loved, and things about it that made me very angry. The only way I can think to write this review is to explain what I found good and bad, and let you all come to your own conclusions.First, let's start with the good things. I loved the way this book was written. Like Water for Chocolate reads like a folktale, and a fun one at that. Some people's reviews that I've read found the magical realism trite or annoying, but I found it really endearing. The book managed to be an easy, quick read without sacrificing quality. Now, I cannot review this book without talking about the recipes. The book is split up into monthly installments, and each month has a recipe that Tita makes that ties the story together. The recipe is given at the beginning of each monthly chapter, and the instructions for preparation are woven into the story. Now, I'm a huge fan of cooking, so I found this idea to be really great. Since so much of the story takes place around and hinges on food, putting the recipes in the book makes perfect sense. I loved the way that the preparation instructions were included in the action of the story. Some people seem to find it gimmicky, but I thought it was a fun little addition to a book already filled with the tastes and smells of good Mexican cooking.Now, for the things that troubled me. First of all, I have to admit that even though I'm a huge lover of all things fairy-tale and myth, I do not like the \"love at first sight\" narrative. It's not that I'm not a romantic, but I feel that real love is something that is built up from a knowledge of a person's character and personality, not something that magically happens when you see someone from across the room. As for Tita's beloved, Pedro, I honestly didn't like him. He spent the entire book being selfish, immature, and whiny. I have no idea what Tita saw in him. While this book started out with that \"love at first sight\" narrative, there is a point that it has the chance to go away from that narrative and treat love in a realistic and touching manner. Honestly, that was the ending I was hoping for, so I was pretty well disappointed with how the book actually ended. For me at least, the ending was the worst part of the book. I feel like it kept the book from really having any particular meaning or significance, and instead just avoided any difficulty and wrapped up as quickly and neatly as possible. It just wasn't satisfying.There were also plot elements that I found really disturbing. There are some *spoilers* in the following paragraph. At one point Pedro completely ignores all concepts of consent and just assumes that Tita wants to have sex with him, even though she has denied him repeatedly because he is married to her sister and she is promised to someone else. Does he care about this? No. Is this seen as a problem in the book? No, of course not. As soon as Pedro grabs her and pulls her into a room, Tita magically forgets all of her previous objections, and it's just seen as more proof that they need to be together. Honestly, I find that to be pretty wrong. If somebody who I had repeatedly told to leave me alone just assumed that I didn't really mean it and that I really wanted to have sex with him and decided to pull me into a dark room, I would kick him so hard he would never want to have sex again. It wouldn't matter how much I actually loved him, if he can't respect my decisions he is not worth my time. Combine that incident with the not-very-sympathetic treatment of a rape victim at another point, and you can imagine that I wasn't exactly happy with the way this book treated consent. *End spoilers here* Basically, this book had some incidents that left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and made me wonder exactly what kind of love the author is trying to promote.Overall, the good writing and fun recipes in this book did not outweigh the problematic elements in the narrative. As much as I wanted to, I could not let myself simply enjoy this book, because problems with the plot and the ideas in the book kept jolting me out of the magical world of the narrative. This book was supposed to be a great love story, but I couldn't help feeling that Tita ended up with the wrong man. The ending of the book was completely disappointing, and only served to cement my growing discomfort. For those of you who don't mind the things that I mentioned, this book could be enjoyable. For those of you who want realistic love and respectful healthy relationships, I would suggest that you stay away from Like Water For Chocolate.Rating: not recommendedGood things: enjoyable writing, fun format, successful magical realismBad things: unrealistic love, unhealthy relationships, consent problems, unsatisfying endingFor more reviews, visit my blog athttp://readingwhilefemale.blogspot.com, error: Have you ever finished a book and thought \"Man, this is going to be hard to review?\" Because that's the first thing I thought when I finished this little book by Laura Esquivel.

            "Translation failed for: Reading is an interesting thing.When I was around 17, I was just getting back into it. I’d spent the later part of my middle school years and the beginning part of my high school ones not reading much at all. This is due to my being deep in long-term tests of a very forced and inauthentic persona, in playing a version of myself who was just way too cool to do all those totally lame things like read, or try in school, or be an even remotely pleasant or interesting person.It was neither convincing nor fun (for anyone involved), and eventually (mercifully) I gave it up.However, the 17-year-old me who was getting back into reading was mostly doing so through the voracious and uncritical consumption of any YA contemporary she could get her hands on, using either her decade-old library card or babysitting money at the mall. Little to no thought was put into what I picked up or what I thought of it. It was all the same to me.When I read this book, I mostly swooned at the idea of a manic-pixie-dream-boy with an interesting name and a Penchant For Wandering. I marked it as read on Goodreads with a five-star rating and a few gushing, meaningless sentences. And there it has sat ever since.Now, I indulge in considering myself a critical reader. (It’s not THAT uncalled for -- my average rating is below three stars.) And some of those outdated, teenage ratings of books I can’t remember have bugged me. None more than this one.So recently(ish), I sucked it up and reread.And wow, did I gloss over a lot.All the negative reviews of this book are right. All the Bright Places is filled with girl hate and the not-like-other-girls trope. The discussion of mental illness, especially medication for and treatment of it, is irresponsible and gross. And the whole thing’s imbued with a John Green-esque glorification of the “special” people, the weirdos, and above all the idea that most people who are living their lives are doing it incorrectly, in a way that is normal and mundane and so f*cking worthless and boring.It’s an exhausting and frustrating read, and while the sheer force of nostalgia (alongside my belief that the author is sweet and well-meaning) prevents me from one-starring it, I can’t pretend this is in any way a good book.Here are some quotes, organized by category.GIRL HATE/NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS“I have bad luck with women. Something about going for the bitchy ones or the crazy ones…”“She is different from all other girls”“bitchy Amanda Monk”“you’re not just any girl”SLUT SHAMING“Amanda’s father owns a chain of liquor stores, which is one of the reasons she’s so popular. That and the fact that she puts out.”“‘I knew him even better than that.’ Her voice goes slutty.” (What does that even mean?)“They told us girls who Do are sluts and girls who Don’t are teases. [...] Amanda said, the only way around it is to stay with one guy forever.’ But does forever have a built in ending…?”“even though the Day Of wasn’t slutty, I feel a little slutty, and also kind of grown up”TERRIBLE TREATMENT OF RACE“Charlie is black. Not CW black, but black-black.”I don’t even have to say that there is absolutely no place in which a white author can ascribe types of blackness in which some are “realer” than others.“Every athletic coach at Bartlett High has been trying to recruit him since he first walked through the school doors, but he refuses to be a black stereotype.”This is just f*cked up.BODY SHAMING“Too many high school girls are built like boys.”The whole character of Mr. Black:“literally the largest man I have ever seen.”“Bren hates all girls who aren’t at least a size twelve.”A body shaming and nonsensical girl hate combo!“Do you think I need to lose weight? Be honest. Do you think any guy will ever have sex with me or love me for who I am?”(Finch’s response to this, which is asked to him directly, is mostly to ignore it.)TREATMENT OF MENTAL ILLNESS“‘I’m OCD,’ ‘I’m depressed,’ ‘I’m a cutter,’ they say, like these are the things that define them. One poor bastard is ADHD, OCD, BPD, bipolar, and on top of it all has some sort of anxiety disorder.

I’d spent the later part of my middle school years and the beginning part of my high school ones not reading much at all. This is due to my being deep in long-term tests of a very forced and inauthentic persona, in playing a version of myself who was just way too cool to do all those totally lame things like read, or try in school, or be an even remotely pleasant or interesting person.It was neither convincing nor fun (for anyone involved), and eventually (mercifully) I gave it up.However, the 17-year-old me who was getting back into reading was mostly doing so through the voracious and uncritical consumption of any YA contemporary she could get her hands on, using either her decade-old library card or babysitting money at the mall. Little to no thought was put into what I picked up or what I thought of it. It was all the same to me.When I read this book, I mostly swooned at the idea of a manic-pixie-dream-boy with an interesting name and a Penchant For Wandering. I marked it as read on Goodreads with a five-star rating and a few gushing, meaningless sentences. And there it has sat ever since.Now, I indulge in considering myself a critical reader. (It’s not THAT uncalled for -- my average rating is below three stars.) And some of those outdated, teenage ratings of books I can’t remember have bugged me. None more than this one.So recently(ish), I sucked it up and reread.And wow, did I gloss over a lot.All the negative reviews of this book are right. All the Bright Places is filled with girl hate and the not-like-other-girls trope. The discussion of mental illness, especially medication for and treatment of it, is irresponsible and gross. And the whole thing’s imbued with a John Green-esque glorification of the “special” people, the weirdos, and above all the idea that most people who are living their lives are doing it incorrectly, in a way that is normal and mundane and so f*cking worthless and boring.It’s an exhausting and frustrating read, and while the sheer force of nostalgia (alongside my belief that the author is sweet and well-meaning) prevents me from one-starring it, I can’t pretend this is in any way a good book.Here are some quotes, organized by category.GIRL HATE/NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS“I have bad luck with women. Something about going for the bitchy ones or the crazy ones…”“She is different from all other girls”“bitchy Amanda Monk”“you’re not just any girl”SLUT SHAMING“Amanda’s father owns a chain of liquor stores, which is one of the reasons she’s so popular. That and the fact that she puts out.”“‘I knew him even better than that.’ Her voice goes slutty.” (What does that even mean?)“They told us girls who Do are sluts and girls who Don’t are teases. [...] Amanda said, the only way around it is to stay with one guy forever.’ But does forever have a built in ending…?”“even though the Day Of wasn’t slutty, I feel a little slutty, and also kind of grown up”TERRIBLE TREATMENT OF RACE“Charlie is black. Not CW black, but black-black.”I don’t even have to say that there is absolutely no place in which a white author can ascribe types of blackness in which some are “realer” than others.“Every athletic coach at Bartlett High has been trying to recruit him since he first walked through the school doors, but he refuses to be a black stereotype.”This is just f*cked up.BODY SHAMING“Too many high school girls are built like boys.”The whole character of Mr. Black:“literally the largest man I have ever seen.”“Bren hates all girls who aren’t at least a size twelve.”A body shaming and nonsensical girl hate combo!“Do you think I need to lose weight? Be honest. Do you think any guy will ever have sex with me or love me for who I am?”(Finch’s response to this, which is asked to him directly, is mostly to ignore it.)TREATMENT OF MENTAL ILLNESS“‘I’m OCD,’ ‘I’m depressed,’ ‘I’m a cutter,’ they say, like these are the things that define them. One poor bastard is ADHD, OCD, BPD, bipolar, and on top of it all has some sort of anxiety disorder. [...] I’m the only one who is just Theodore Finch.”It is so irresponsible and hateful to portray medications negatively, ESPECIALLY as killing what makes you “you.”Also, Amanda confides in Violet that she went to a support group for suicide, and Violet’s ONLY RESPONSE is to care that Finch was there.SEMI UNRELATED COMPLAININGJust a fun thing if you want to lose any remaining faith you have in humanity:This book is being adapted into a film (because of course it is).

Perhaps the only thing this book achieves is that it manages be what it set out to be. It fails in its other aspects quite spectacularly. It isn't well-written in the least, the prose is repetitive, clunky, and boring, and it is a hundred pages longer than it should have been. It tries, in its own ways, to be empowering and feminist, and in this regard, also, it fails. Finally, it also tries and fails to be an accurate commentary of life in show biz.

She and her friends Neely and Jennifer are just three girls trying to make it in '40s New York. Anne, educated at Radcliffe, is an all-American girl, who starts off as a secretary, but becomes the face of a cosmetics line.

Would have worked too, had Susann not decided to make caricatures of her characters.Neely is seventeen when she becomes a star, and of course, it gets to her head. She becomes tempermental and moody. Signs of a genius, they call it, until it becomes too much for them. She becomes addicted to the dolls - to maintain her figure, to help her sleep, to stay sane. Her first marriage to the doting Mel fails because of her vanity and infidelity. Her second to Ted, because of his. Throughout the story, despite her childish behaviour, in spite of her tantrums, I never hated Neely. She came up through pure talent, and that was rare. She did stupid things. She had nervous breakdowns. I liked her through it all. Until. Until she performs her last act of ultimate betrayal. And thusly, she was made a caricature. A caricature of a talented Hollywood superstar whose personal life is in a complete shambles, who turns out to be a total stereotype.Susann doesn't know when to stop, and that seems to be this book's biggest problem. She takes perfectly good characters and makes you hate them with such seething passion, you begin to question your hatred of pretty much everything else. She had, in this book, an opportunity to step away from stereotypes and deliver something real, but she didn't, and somehow, I'm disappointed that she didn't.In a way, I was glad for Jennifer's untimely death because at least her story didn't get stretched to a point that made no sense.Anne, sweet Anne whom I liked despite her pathetic and dogged devotion to Lyon who really didn't deserve it. Until, of course, the last two pages, because somehow Susann doesn't want me to like her book at all. I felt sorry for Jennifer because she was a genuinely good person who made some terrible choices. And on whose body and face more value was placed than on her as a person. Except by Anne, and maybe Henry. Henry was truly the only character I genuinely liked in this book, and dammit, he should've had more screen space.Susann takes issues like feminism, and to an extent, even addiction, and makes a mockery of them. Not directly, but because of the way she talks about these things. She seems like she's giving her women the power to fly, but she instead clips their wings by making them deeply flawed and superficial. Not that there's a problem with either, but it's like she's not even trying. In a way, it seems like she is shaming women for rejecting stability and the ideals of life for a woman by showing its dire consequences.The reason this book fails ultimately is because of its ending. Look, I'm not the kind of person who expects a sunshine and rainbows ending all the time. But after I invest hours reading some 400 pages of which half was unnecessary, the least you can do is give me a halfway decent ending.

One, a novel,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, and the other, Tina Fey's autobiographyBossypants. Both of them handle similar themes as this book, but do so with a much greater elegance.

In the ubiquitous love triangle. So manufactured and so terribly unneccessary and really, can these authors think of nothing else to add tension to a story or, I should say, tolengthena story?Again, too much of this book is wandering in the Wilds, in the cold, in the snow, and some of the things make no sense. They have no eating utensils. None. So they eat with their hands. They have plates, cooking pots, they even have metal traps for hunting but not a single spoon or fork. And so I am stuck on that. Why? I think they could find some small tree branch, whittle a bowl shape at one end and you've got a spoon. Surely while they are sitting around in the evenings, someone could be creating some spoons. It just seemed stupid.And again, if you are creating this world, kindly explain it. WHY did the government decide love was a disease?How did this happen?To say, here is this world, but never explain anything about it, well, that feels like lazy writing. It feels like a child stamping their feet and declaring \"because I said so\" rather than crafting an intelligently thought-out society. Yes, outlawing love in general makes absolutley no sense and because of that, the author needs to sell it to me with everything she has that it does in some way make sense to the leaders of this world.There are small things that I feel were put there to make you think there is some weird sexual obsession by the government, but that goes nowhere.

How about simply saying \"... while a man sweeps impassively with the wand over every inch of my body.\" That would at the very least make sense and not put the message that somehow women's private areas have become the things about which safety experts are the most concerned.

There wasn't any reason for this, particularly as the Then portion just ends without actually linking up with the Now.

            "Translation failed for: Pre-read thoughts:I was in a lengthy debate with myself over the measure of whether I wanted to read it or not, but I've decided to just give it a go. I'll admit I'm critical because many NA titles have left me burned as a result and I can't say I've had many to speak fondly of considering some of the issues they have and how they've approached them. I'm going to approach this with an open mind and see if it surprises me, though.Post-read thoughts:I'm just going to copy verbatim what I said in my last status update: Good messages, but contrived presentation and unrealistic characterization. I'm quite disappointed, sadly. It's definitely not the worst I've read in this genre or in general, but I have a lot of words.Full review:Tammara Webber's \"Easy\" is a rather inaccurate, formulaic, and juvenile portrayal of the emotional consequence, debate, and coming to terms in the aftermath of rape/sexual assault in a college environment.I could end the review right on those notes alone, but the unspoken question (aside from whatever projectile objects might be thrown at me for making such a statement) might be why I say this about the novel. It's difficult enough for me to speak against the grain when there have been so many people, in my reading circles, friends, among those who have read this book, who have sang its praises. I don't really feel pressured in reviewing this and speaking my mind, but dangnabit, I have to wonder why not very many people saw the very rampant problems that were in this book that counteracted its respective messages. I think there's something to be said in the individual reading experiences we have and what we are able to see or not see in that measure. I'm totally respectful of that, and I recognize that in other works that I perhaps loved, but others disliked, I may have been more forgiving or seen certain angles of a story very differently. I think that's fine. Unfortunately, for my experience reading \"Easy\", I saw many, many problematic elements here.To be blunt - where was I during the heart-wrenching, tear jerking events, sing its praises purported feminism, and \"OMG squee\" worthy moments of this book? I don't think they ever arrived. I don't think there was a single moment where I saw this as a multidimensional story with multiple stakes, or a coming to terms for ANY of the characters here, especially the heroine. I struggled on the part of caring for the characters because they were so one-dimensional, cookie cutter caricatures lacking the kind of depth and flesh to make them matter as people dealing with real trials and tribulations. More on that a little later in this review.\"Easy\" had some positive messages in spells, which I liked because it's leaps and bounds better than some of the peer books in this category. However, the book features a plethora of problematic elements to counterbalance the positive statements.Where do I begin? I suppose it's worth saying that the first chapter begins with a graphic sexual assault scene. Trigger warning to anyone who picks up this book. I'll admit it hit me hard as I listened to the audiobook version, not just for the graphic nature of it, but the formulaic notation. I know this book was written and published before Erin McCarthy's \"True\", but I have to give \"Easy\" the same criticism: starting a book with a rape or near rape scene as a tie linking the two leads together isn't my idea of romantic. A measure in which someone is either raped or nearly raped is a horrifying experience.Sure there's a trope in literature where the damsel is distress is saved by the hero in a moment of peril. It's a common one, I understand there are some who don't seem to mind it or actually like that trope for preference. But when you hinge a story like this with such a heavy backdrop of rape/SA and how the heroine comes to terms with it, do you really want to play up the romantic angle against the psychological angles, completely shortchanging the latter on behalf of the former?That latter notation is exactly what this book did. I'll admit that was the moment I knew this book could either go in a really bad direction or not really amount to as much as it likely could've done.This story is from the perspective of a college sophomore Jackie (I'll call her this because it's easier, but in the story, she prefers Jacqueline) who has to cope with the aftermath of being nearly raped at a party. She's saved by a stranger (Lucas) who just happens upon her and her would be rapist (Buck). Lucas and Jackie have a tentatively developing relationship following said event, and while Jackie does have reactions of fear in the aftermath of her encounter with Buck, whom she claims she's known for a year, I found it difficult to believe. Her fear is quite threadbare. I won't go so far as saying that a rape victim perhaps wouldn't have felt some of the same things that Jackie goes through (saying that she wouldn't call the police and disrupt the party and blaming herself, even when Lucas tells her she shouldn't), but it's hard to read, because mentally I'm telling myself the right thing to do where she didn't act upon it. Rape victims go through many different motions depending upon their experiences, backgrounds, knowledge, mental assertions among other things. To assume that there's just one reaction to a rape/sexual assault is limiting at best, so I'm glad when an author can explore a character's mindset as to what they think, feel, fear, and bargain in the aftermath.I could probably get behind the author doing that with respect to Jackie for realism considering in the aftermath of a traumatic event, there are people who do think that way. But then, the narrative continues on like she doesn't have any sexual triggers stemming from the event in the aftermath. She flinches when Buck threatens her and she's in his presence, but to assume that it doesn't have an affect with her relationship with Lucas? Not so much. To top it off, I was actually annoyed with the instalove that's woven into Jackie and Lucas's encounter. The characters themselves are set pieces, really.Benji, the gay friend/sidekick who edges Jackie's relationship on and comes out to his parents, but there's not a thing the reader learns about him otherwise (I actually wanted to know him more because I liked his character voice).Erin, the best friend, who thankfully doesn't slut shame or blame Jackie for what happened, and she does drop her boyfriend when he supports Buck on the allegations of rape, but I still found it difficult to delve into her character. She keeps encouraging Jackie to make her relationship work with Lucas, and I felt like I was in the middle of reading a chick-lit novel that emphasized the romance rather than the very complex stakes that the heroine endures.Lucas, the tattooed hero who not only has a contrived conflict with the heroine considering a double identity he has, but also has a past which could've been handled with so much better weight than what the narrative provided. It was supposed to be \"shocking\", but the way the heroine discovers the truth is so...so darned annoying. I hated Jackie's jealous streaks and how that pertained to Lucas, and I hated that she didn't trust him enough And it felt like a way to milk the conflict rather than an actual coming to terms for Lucas.Buck, who I honestly have to say that I'm really disappointed in how his character came across as pretty much as nothing more than the \"evil rapist\". Not a lick of realism. It felt like he was either the villain in a Gossip Girl episode or a formulaic Lifetime movie, as if he wanted to leap from the bushes at some point to tackle and torment the heroine. It felt like such a blatant display of conflict that would not necessarily happen in real life. He tries to assault Jackie three times. THREE TIMES. In at least one of those times, Jackie willingly shows up in the same place she knows he's going to be and doesn't feel the least bit anxious about it. It just wasn't shown well, and it felt contrived. And I feel like the morality play here was milked a bit because there's the overt measure that Jackie (alongside Erin, with Lucas being an instructor) learns self defense and just so happens to be able to *use* that self defense when he encounters her for the third time. It's too darned convenient.Don't get me started on the professor/former officer who just so happens to be Lucas and Jackie's instructor. That was also too convenient for the latter conflict of the novel regarding Lucas's past. I also sincerely doubt that a professor in a college would be so forgiving of a student who missed two weeks, including a major midterm, on the front of \"romantic problems.\" Jackie was unceremoniously dumped by her former boyfriend Kennedy in the beginning of the novel.Speaking of Kennedy, I hated him as well, but at least he was intended to be hated on the part of the way he dumps the heroine by making the excuse that he wanted to see other women and that he was dumping her for the sake of preserving his future. Not only that, he totally victim blames a girl who was raped by Buck AND makes the comment that he at first thought Jackie was fabricating her story just because she was upset for breaking up with him. I mentally told him to go screw himself so many times in the course of this novel (to Jackie's credit, so did she). I didn't necessarily think his inclusion as a character was a bad one because it did give many opportunities for the author to knock down these stereotypes, but it still felt like he wasn't more than a set piece in this overarching novel.Then there's one character (Note, just ONE character) who makes an impassioned speech against the \"mean girls\" of the sorority that Erin is a part of (Buck rapes another girl who is a member there. Apparently it was shown that many of the girls totally didn't believe either the girl that was raped or Jackie's near attempt, but this character actually come across in a prime scene to knock down the slut shaming/victim blaming that goes on because of her personal experiences. I thought that was one of the more potent aspects of the novel, but it felt like it wasn't enough for the narrative, nor did her character really have that much scene time to really make it count in the overarching narrative.There are other characters I could name that fall into these cookie cutter roles, but I'm going to double back to Lucas because for a \"bad boy\" hero who saves the heroine and knows she was nearly raped - I have to question some of his particular actions towards the heroine, including touching her as he's trying to sketch her when she's obviously uncomfortable with it, and while he may ask her in certain spells whether she's comfortable doing something, he negates asking her in others. Plus there's one scene where he touches her, but when she goes to touch him, he dismisses it quickly. Argh. He wasn't a swoon-worthy hero to me at all, and he lacked the dimension/definition of his character to really bring me into his experiences and character.Finally, as if these fundamental problems with story and characterization weren't enough, the college environment is pretty inaccurate on a number of levels. No specificity to the school, contradicting information about the classes the characters attend, and just a general lack of immersion in the environment itself - I'll admit some aspects were okay in terms of Jackie being concerned about her grades and working on homework, but it feels like the scope was too narrow with respect to this being a story set in a college environment. It's proposed to be a large university measure, but I didn't really feel like it was that significant to the story, and aspects of it, like Erin McCarthy's \"True\" and even Jamie McGuire's \"Beautiful Disaster\" - felt more like a secluded high school environment. I get that the sorority/fraternity segments were clique-ish and somewhat isolated compared to the rest of campus, but it still felt like the tone of this story communicated this overarching acceptance of the strife that Jackie among some of the other characters endured with Buck's actions, but the story made it seem like the characters affected were the only ones speaking out against it.If you've followed some of the cases in the media about rape/sexual assault on a college campusshown here, it's a more complex issue with multiple sides and dimensions, and with people striving to figure ways to approach the issue - administrators, students, instructors, campus groups, etc. I got angry with this book for narrowing it in such a scope in comparison to the \"love\" story here. It could've been a much more constructive, dimensional story, but it didn't go as far to show it in a realistic fashion.Long story short, this narrative didn't really wow me or bring me into its respective relationships, conflicts, among other dimensions. It not only limits the discussion and presentation of a tough issue, but also delves into formulaic, problematic romantic cliches, doesn't present the matters in a realistic spectrum, and doesn't necessarily delve into a coming to terms on a number of levels. Even for some moments of construction for what it provided, it wasn't enough, and sometimes even contradictory or inaccurate.I'll leave you with a song that came to mind when thinking about tattooed tormented heroes (which this book tried to show, but it didn't necessarily show Lucas's story all that well, nor with respect to the heroine's actions), people who lose their way or experience great deals of strife. It came to mind as I wrote this review. Pat Benatar's \"Somebody's Baby\" is a punch gut song, and I think of the opening scene where it shows a 29-year old father - shirtless and sporting tattoos, standing with his son. The video puts a brief statement of his story alongside the fact that he loves his kid. I actually felt more for the stories of the men in that video than I did for any of the males in this book, Lucas included.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rhUHD...Overall score: 2/5, error: Pre-read thoughts:I was in a lengthy debate with myself over the measure of whether I wanted to read it or not, but I've decided to just give it a go. I'll admit I'm critical because many NA titles have left me burned as a result and I can't say I've had many to speak fondly of considering some of the issues they have and how they've approached them. I'm going to approach this with an open mind and see if it surprises me, though.Post-read thoughts:I'm just going to copy verbatim what I said in my last status update: Good messages, but contrived presentation and unrealistic characterization. I'm quite disappointed, sadly. It's definitely not the worst I've read in this genre or in general, but I have a lot of words.Full review:Tammara Webber's \"Easy\" is a rather inaccurate, formulaic, and juvenile portrayal of the emotional consequence, debate, and coming to terms in the aftermath of rape/sexual assault in a college environment.I could end the review right on those notes alone, but the unspoken question (aside from whatever projectile objects might be thrown at me for making such a statement) might be why I say this about the novel. It's difficult enough for me to speak against the grain when there have been so many people, in my reading circles, friends, among those who have read this book, who have sang its praises. I don't really feel pressured in reviewing this and speaking my mind, but dangnabit, I have to wonder why not very many people saw the very rampant problems that were in this book that counteracted its respective messages. I think there's something to be said in the individual reading experiences we have and what we are able to see or not see in that measure. I'm totally respectful of that, and I recognize that in other works that I perhaps loved, but others disliked, I may have been more forgiving or seen certain angles of a story very differently. I think that's fine. Unfortunately, for my experience reading \"Easy\", I saw many, many problematic elements here.To be blunt - where was I during the heart-wrenching, tear jerking events, sing its praises purported feminism, and \"OMG squee\" worthy moments of this book? I don't think they ever arrived. I don't think there was a single moment where I saw this as a multidimensional story with multiple stakes, or a coming to terms for ANY of the characters here, especially the heroine. I struggled on the part of caring for the characters because they were so one-dimensional, cookie cutter caricatures lacking the kind of depth and flesh to make them matter as people dealing with real trials and tribulations. More on that a little later in this review.\"Easy\" had some positive messages in spells, which I liked because it's leaps and bounds better than some of the peer books in this category. However, the book features a plethora of problematic elements to counterbalance the positive statements.Where do I begin? I suppose it's worth saying that the first chapter begins with a graphic sexual assault scene. Trigger warning to anyone who picks up this book. I'll admit it hit me hard as I listened to the audiobook version, not just for the graphic nature of it, but the formulaic notation. I know this book was written and published before Erin McCarthy's \"True\", but I have to give \"Easy\" the same criticism: starting a book with a rape or near rape scene as a tie linking the two leads together isn't my idea of romantic. A measure in which someone is either raped or nearly raped is a horrifying experience.Sure there's a trope in literature where the damsel is distress is saved by the hero in a moment of peril. It's a common one, I understand there are some who don't seem to mind it or actually like that trope for preference. But when you hinge a story like this with such a heavy backdrop of rape/SA and how the heroine comes to terms with it, do you really want to play up the romantic angle against the psychological angles, completely shortchanging the latter on behalf of the former?That latter notation is exactly what this book did. I'll admit that was the moment I knew this book could either go in a really bad direction or not really amount to as much as it likely could've done.This story is from the perspective of a college sophomore Jackie (I'll call her this because it's easier, but in the story, she prefers Jacqueline) who has to cope with the aftermath of being nearly raped at a party. She's saved by a stranger (Lucas) who just happens upon her and her would be rapist (Buck). Lucas and Jackie have a tentatively developing relationship following said event, and while Jackie does have reactions of fear in the aftermath of her encounter with Buck, whom she claims she's known for a year, I found it difficult to believe. Her fear is quite threadbare. I won't go so far as saying that a rape victim perhaps wouldn't have felt some of the same things that Jackie goes through (saying that she wouldn't call the police and disrupt the party and blaming herself, even when Lucas tells her she shouldn't), but it's hard to read, because mentally I'm telling myself the right thing to do where she didn't act upon it. Rape victims go through many different motions depending upon their experiences, backgrounds, knowledge, mental assertions among other things. To assume that there's just one reaction to a rape/sexual assault is limiting at best, so I'm glad when an author can explore a character's mindset as to what they think, feel, fear, and bargain in the aftermath.I could probably get behind the author doing that with respect to Jackie for realism considering in the aftermath of a traumatic event, there are people who do think that way. But then, the narrative continues on like she doesn't have any sexual triggers stemming from the event in the aftermath. She flinches when Buck threatens her and she's in his presence, but to assume that it doesn't have an affect with her relationship with Lucas? Not so much.

I hated Jackie's jealous streaks and how that pertained to Lucas, and I hated that she didn't trust him enough And it felt like a way to milk the conflict rather than an actual coming to terms for Lucas.Buck, who I honestly have to say that I'm really disappointed in how his character came across as pretty much as nothing more than the \"evil rapist\".

            "Translation failed for: Thoughts on The DispossessedOf the various layers of content in The Dispossessed, the most obvious is the socio-political: capitalism vs. anarchistic-communism. The claim often made is that, even though her heart is with the latter, she nonetheless treats the two structures impartially. The claim or presumption is to be found in the reviews of fantasy/science fiction devotees, those with a particular interest in anarchism and, I suspect, also those who simply read it with an uncritical eye.I don’t see that at all. Not surprisingly, given where her sympathies lie, le Guin has created the best possible picture of anarchistic communism and the worst of capitalism. In creating a capitalist society which has at its apex overwhelming plenty, perched on a base of workers whose existence is miserable beyond belief – going to hospital typically means being eaten by rats if one is poor – le Guin has created a capitalist society which is not only a morally reprehensible model but a very stupid one. Capitalism has known for a long time that one keeps those making up the base of support happy by giving them enough. That principle pertains throughout our society and there is no reason I can see to explain why le Guin’s capitalist model is different from that.Contrast the anarchistic-communist model she proffers. By placing it in a poor, harsh geography, she creates the perfect setting for that model to succeed. Although superficially she is seen to consider the difficulties with the structure – when harsh becomes drought-induced-impossible, how does one decide who lives and who dies in this society – it is obvious that the real difficulties with the model arise when one considers physical ease and economic plenty. I can’t begin to see how any anarchistic-communist model then works, let alone one which has specifically been constructed on the presumption of struggle, survival, utility, function, purpose. The model she presents borrows much from the experience of the kibbutz movement in Israel. As it has failed, so too it is impossible to imagine her ideal society surviving.This is the only le Guin I’ve read. Are all her books so stilted and contrived in style? There is a point at which dispassion by the author is hard to distinguish from a boredom that is infectious. I stopped readingThe Seducerto take onThe Dispossessedand this has made me appreciate how well-written the former is.It has been argued that the dull tedious style is necessary to portray the poverty and utilitarianism of her utopian society. Sorry, I can’t see that for one moment. The woman hates writing, it is – unhappily for both her and her readers – a necessary medium to communicate her ideas. If she had commissions Ray Bradbury to turn her ideas into words, he would have made something beautiful without betraying the style she wishes to impose. But, then, Ray Bradbury loves writing.Look, for example, at this list:p.110 Coats, dresses, gowns, robes, trousers, breeches, shirts, blouses, hats, shoes, stockings, scarves, shawls, vests, capes, umbrellas, clothes to wear while sleeping, while swimming, while playing games, while at an afternoon party, while at an evening party, while at a party in the country, while travelling, while at the theatre, while riding horses, gardning, receiving guests, boating, dining, hunting – all different, all in hundreds of different cuts, styles, colours, textures, materials. Perfumes, clocks, lamps, statues, cosmetics, candles, pictures, cameras, games, vases, sofas, kettles, puzzles, pillows, dolls, colanders, hassocks, jewels, carpets, toothpicks, calendars, a baby’s teething rattle of platinum with a handle of rock crystal, an electrical machine to sharpen pencils, a wristwatch with diamond numerals, figurines and souvenirs and kickshaws and mementoes and gewgars and bric a brac, everything either useless to begin with or ornamented so as to disguise its use; acrues of luxuries, acres of excrement.Sorry, but my average weekly shopping list is a more interesting read. Compare this list fromThe Seducer:p 63 I must be allowed to say a little bit about bicyles…because bikes occupy a very special place in people’s memories – just think of the palpable thrill that runs through the body at the memory of the drag when a dynamo is flipped in against a tyre. And even more than the bike itself, what one remembers are all the accessories and trimmings. In fact, I would go as far as to say that for many people the status seeking that has since manifested itself in having as many letters and digits as possible after the name of a car had its beginnings right here. I could mention at random the different types of handlebars, not least the so-called ‘speedway’ handlebars which were all the rage for some time and which, if I remember correctly, were even banned, in keeping with the Norwegian fondness for every possible sort of safeguard, and which boasted such features as luminous handgrips with little nubs that pressed into the palm of your hand, and gears – source of such stories as, for example, how Frankenstein pedalled up the steep slope of Badedamsbakken in ‘third’, sitting down – and a speedometer, an item which in Jonas’s day was long a rarity, owned only by boys like Wolfgang Michaelsen, not to mention a lamp of the type that had two little yellow lights on either side of the big one, like fog-lights, and last but not least, the obligatory bell, which the really cool guys replaced with a beauty of a horn. Then you had the wide variety of different saddles, foremost among them the banana seat, motorbike-style, which suddenly became the in thing, and the accompanying cross-country tyres and who could forget those mud-flaps emblazoned with an ‘N’, as if one were all set to cycle across Europe? Anything else? Oh, yes, the toll kit on the carrier with its carefully stowed contents, anticipating the suitcase-packing problem in that everything had to be slotted into exactly the right place or the lid wouldn’t close. This fastened with a little padlock, available in various colours, and came complete with minute keys; which in turn brings me on to the advent of the combination lock, with a cat’s eye on the knob, and the hunt for the most baffling combination, which was engraved on a little copy of the lock itself and which, for some, represented their first encounter with the recursive element in life. Lastly, I ought to mention all the badges for sticking onto the mudguagd, and the pennant, its rod vibrating so delightfully, and then, of course, the flags and foxtails that made you feel like the Shah of Persia as you rode around the blocks of flats. But one of the most interesting features in this connection was the trimming of the wheel-spokes, first with empty cigarette packs: Ascot, Speed, Jolly, Blue Master and, above all, Monte Carlo, the menthol Virginia cigarette that came in three varieties – yellow, red and black – adorned with little paintings which today seem quite exotic, like works of art from a bygone age, and later with triangles formed out of fuse-wire, which is to say copper wire of the sort insulated with different coloured plastics.Nowthatis a list. A lovingly constructed list by a man whose delight it is to write.Perhaps when going through the process of making up a language, it is perforce going to make for tedious presentation. Coming toThe Dispossessedas one whose science fiction days have long passed and who has never had any sympathy for fantasy, this whole process generally irritates me, it seems such an effort for nothing. Why can’t the characters be called Barry and Kevin and Patsy? Why do they have to be Shevek and Pae? Why does the toilet have to be the shittery? Having begun the book with no patience for this, I eventually came around to the idea that her anarchistic society had to create its own language and culture.Still, I’m not convinced by the linguistics side of the story but I’m too ignorant of the area to feel comfortably criticizing it. Is the way in which the language is established and developed credible? My gut feeling is not. Nicholas Tam, in a detailed review of the book to be found herehttp://www.nicholastam.ca/2008/10/15/...has this to say:“…the linguistics in The Dispossessed adhere to a Whorfian model that is inconsistently applied. Pravic, the Esperanto-like language spoken on Anarres, was planned and designed to fit the needs of a communist utopia where property and class do not exist. Le Guin’s presentation of this is quite elegant: she “translates” the disparities between Pravic and Iotic (the language spoken in A-Io on Urras), along with the occasional code-switching, into English analogues—thereby avoiding the indulgent trap of science fiction and fantasy that Randall Munroe so helpfully illustrates:’Nonetheless, he is not altogether happy with the linguistics of it. I can’t help but feel that if one is going to all that trouble to invent a language, one might as well be careful about it. Le Guin’s ‘utopia’ has no word or concept for ‘wife’ but sure enough the girl who drops in to deliver the baby is a midwife. That doesn’t seem consistent to me, but perhaps a linguist will take me to task.Personally, I don’t understand why believability has to be achieved through the device of inventing language. Nor, if it comes to that, the concept dear to le Guin’s heart, numinousness. Good writing will create that effect any time over artificial devices, linguistic or otherwise. Again, Ray Bradbury achieves numinousness through nothing more than lovingly applied craft and a sensitive imagination. Since, however,The Dispossessedis polemic in nature, perhaps it is as it has to be.I’m also unsure about the structure of the book. I’m generally distrusting of books that split a story into two or have two separate stories going at once. My immediate response is that they don’t stack up to a straight chronological narrative layout….but again, perhaps if there is a book that needs such a form this is it.Compared with these big pictures aspects of the book – the linguistic, the politico-social – I felt more comfortable with her philosophical considerations at a micro or personal level. Scientists who have reviewed this book are very accepting of her main character, Shevek and his development. It not being my area I’m happy to take their word for it. I find him a very dull character, slow on the uptake. It takes him 40 years to understand things about his own society which seemed obvious and which his friends knew since they were teenagers. Is that supposed to be part of the point of the book? That he is brainwashed so convincingly by his society that this holds up his own personal development, even as a scientist, so that when he finally has his epiphany, the reader is left thinking, that could have been twenty years earlier if only he’d been open-minded.Le Guin espouses all sorts of personal/interpersonal philosophy I live by. It did not altogether fit in with my understanding that in this period she wrote ‘for men’. Her argument in favour of absolute fidelity in the context of partnership, and her observation that life and even mere sex are meaningless without both fidelity and partnership, are pretty much what I’ve believed since, like her stepping-out-of-teenage experimentation-characters, I realised that sex was nothing. It is only the loving partnership that makes it something. Is that really something written for men? The male reviews I’ve looked at make no comment on this side of the book.I was especially taken by a scene where Shevek, after some years of abject misery both personally and work-wise finds Takver. It takes them seconds to realise that they will be together for life. Sadly, they had met a long time earlier, but although she knew he was the one, he saw her, but did not see. Still, there is no point regretting what cannot be undone:‘It was now clear to Shevek, and he would have thought it folly to think otherwise, that his wretched years in his city, had all been part of his present great happiness, because they had led up to it, prepared him for it. Everything that had happened to him was part of what was happening to him now.’Lately, before I read this book, I’ve been explaining the last 33 years of my life that way. This is the time when I felt like writing for le Guin is not just hard work, when she is writing about love., error: Thoughts on The DispossessedOf the various layers of content in The Dispossessed, the most obvious is the socio-political: capitalism vs. anarchistic-communism.

By placing it in a poor, harsh geography, she creates the perfect setting for that model to succeed. Although superficially she is seen to consider the difficulties with the structure – when harsh becomes drought-induced-impossible, how does one decide who lives and who dies in this society – it is obvious that the real difficulties with the model arise when one considers physical ease and economic plenty. I can’t begin to see how any anarchistic-communist model then works, let alone one which has specifically been constructed on the presumption of struggle, survival, utility, function, purpose. The model she presents borrows much from the experience of the kibbutz movement in Israel. As it has failed, so too it is impossible to imagine her ideal society surviving.This is the only le Guin I’ve read. Are all her books so stilted and contrived in style? There is a point at which dispassion by the author is hard to distinguish from a boredom that is infectious. I stopped readingThe Seducerto take onThe Dispossessedand this has made me appreciate how well-written the former is.It has been argued that the dull tedious style is necessary to portray the poverty and utilitarianism of her utopian society. Sorry, I can’t see that for one moment. The woman hates writing, it is – unhappily for both her and her readers – a necessary medium to communicate her ideas. If she had commissions Ray Bradbury to turn her ideas into words, he would have made something beautiful without betraying the style she wishes to impose. But, then, Ray Bradbury loves writing.Look, for example, at this list:p.110 Coats, dresses, gowns, robes, trousers, breeches, shirts, blouses, hats, shoes, stockings, scarves, shawls, vests, capes, umbrellas, clothes to wear while sleeping, while swimming, while playing games, while at an afternoon party, while at an evening party, while at a party in the country, while travelling, while at the theatre, while riding horses, gardning, receiving guests, boating, dining, hunting – all different, all in hundreds of different cuts, styles, colours, textures, materials. Perfumes, clocks, lamps, statues, cosmetics, candles, pictures, cameras, games, vases, sofas, kettles, puzzles, pillows, dolls, colanders, hassocks, jewels, carpets, toothpicks, calendars, a baby’s teething rattle of platinum with a handle of rock crystal, an electrical machine to sharpen pencils, a wristwatch with diamond numerals, figurines and souvenirs and kickshaws and mementoes and gewgars and bric a brac, everything either useless to begin with or ornamented so as to disguise its use; acrues of luxuries, acres of excrement.Sorry, but my average weekly shopping list is a more interesting read. Compare this list fromThe Seducer:p 63 I must be allowed to say a little bit about bicyles…because bikes occupy a very special place in people’s memories – just think of the palpable thrill that runs through the body at the memory of the drag when a dynamo is flipped in against a tyre. And even more than the bike itself, what one remembers are all the accessories and trimmings. In fact, I would go as far as to say that for many people the status seeking that has since manifested itself in having as many letters and digits as possible after the name of a car had its beginnings right here. I could mention at random the different types of handlebars, not least the so-called ‘speedway’ handlebars which were all the rage for some time and which, if I remember correctly, were even banned, in keeping with the Norwegian fondness for every possible sort of safeguard, and which boasted such features as luminous handgrips with little nubs that pressed into the palm of your hand, and gears – source of such stories as, for example, how Frankenstein pedalled up the steep slope of Badedamsbakken in ‘third’, sitting down – and a speedometer, an item which in Jonas’s day was long a rarity, owned only by boys like Wolfgang Michaelsen, not to mention a lamp of the type that had two little yellow lights on either side of the big one, like fog-lights, and last but not least, the obligatory bell, which the really cool guys replaced with a beauty of a horn. Then you had the wide variety of different saddles, foremost among them the banana seat, motorbike-style, which suddenly became the in thing, and the accompanying cross-country tyres and who could forget those mud-flaps emblazoned with an ‘N’, as if one were all set to cycle across Europe? Anything else? Oh, yes, the toll kit on the carrier with its carefully stowed contents, anticipating the suitcase-packing problem in that everything had to be slotted into exactly the right place or the lid wouldn’t close. This fastened with a little padlock, available in various colours, and came complete with minute keys; which in turn brings me on to the advent of the combination lock, with a cat’s eye on the knob, and the hunt for the most baffling combination, which was engraved on a little copy of the lock itself and which, for some, represented their first encounter with the recursive element in life. Lastly, I ought to mention all the badges for sticking onto the mudguagd, and the pennant, its rod vibrating so delightfully, and then, of course, the flags and foxtails that made you feel like the Shah of Persia as you rode around the blocks of flats. But one of the most interesting features in this connection was the trimming of the wheel-spokes, first with empty cigarette packs: Ascot, Speed, Jolly, Blue Master and, above all, Monte Carlo, the menthol Virginia cigarette that came in three varieties – yellow, red and black – adorned with little paintings which today seem quite exotic, like works of art from a bygone age, and later with triangles formed out of fuse-wire, which is to say copper wire of the sort insulated with different coloured plastics.Nowthatis a list. A lovingly constructed list by a man whose delight it is to write.Perhaps when going through the process of making up a language, it is perforce going to make for tedious presentation. Coming toThe Dispossessedas one whose science fiction days have long passed and who has never had any sympathy for fantasy, this whole process generally irritates me, it seems such an effort for nothing. Why can’t the characters be called Barry and Kevin and Patsy? Why do they have to be Shevek and Pae? Why does the toilet have to be the shittery? Having begun the book with no patience for this, I eventually came around to the idea that her anarchistic society had to create its own language and culture.Still, I’m not convinced by the linguistics side of the story but I’m too ignorant of the area to feel comfortably criticizing it. Is the way in which the language is established and developed credible? My gut feeling is not. Nicholas Tam, in a detailed review of the book to be found herehttp://www.nicholastam.ca/2008/10/15/...has this to say:“…the linguistics in The Dispossessed adhere to a Whorfian model that is inconsistently applied. Pravic, the Esperanto-like language spoken on Anarres, was planned and designed to fit the needs of a communist utopia where property and class do not exist. Le Guin’s presentation of this is quite elegant: she “translates” the disparities between Pravic and Iotic (the language spoken in A-Io on Urras), along with the occasional code-switching, into English analogues—thereby avoiding the indulgent trap of science fiction and fantasy that Randall Munroe so helpfully illustrates:’Nonetheless, he is not altogether happy with the linguistics of it. I can’t help but feel that if one is going to all that trouble to invent a language, one might as well be careful about it. Le Guin’s ‘utopia’ has no word or concept for ‘wife’ but sure enough the girl who drops in to deliver the baby is a midwife. That doesn’t seem consistent to me, but perhaps a linguist will take me to task.Personally, I don’t understand why believability has to be achieved through the device of inventing language. Nor, if it comes to that, the concept dear to le Guin’s heart, numinousness. Good writing will create that effect any time over artificial devices, linguistic or otherwise. Again, Ray Bradbury achieves numinousness through nothing more than lovingly applied craft and a sensitive imagination. Since, however,The Dispossessedis polemic in nature, perhaps it is as it has to be.I’m also unsure about the structure of the book. I’m generally distrusting of books that split a story into two or have two separate stories going at once. My immediate response is that they don’t stack up to a straight chronological narrative layout….but again, perhaps if there is a book that needs such a form this is it.Compared with these big pictures aspects of the book – the linguistic, the politico-social – I felt more comfortable with her philosophical considerations at a micro or personal level. Scientists who have reviewed this book are very accepting of her main character, Shevek and his development. It not being my area I’m happy to take their word for it. I find him a very dull character, slow on the uptake. It takes him 40 years to understand things about his own society which seemed obvious and which his friends knew since they were teenagers. Is that supposed to be part of the point of the book? That he is brainwashed so convincingly by his society that this holds up his own personal development, even as a scientist, so that when he finally has his epiphany, the reader is left thinking, that could have been twenty years earlier if only he’d been open-minded.Le Guin espouses all sorts of personal/interpersonal philosophy I live by. It did not altogether fit in with my understanding that in this period she wrote ‘for men’. Her argument in favour of absolute fidelity in the context of partnership, and her observation that life and even mere sex are meaningless without both fidelity and partnership, are pretty much what I’ve believed since, like her stepping-out-of-teenage experimentation-characters, I realised that sex was nothing. It is only the loving partnership that makes it something. Is that really something written for men? The male reviews I’ve looked at make no comment on this side of the book.I was especially taken by a scene where Shevek, after some years of abject misery both personally and work-wise finds Takver. It takes them seconds to realise that they will be together for life. Sadly, they had met a long time earlier, but although she knew he was the one, he saw her, but did not see. Still, there is no point regretting what cannot be undone:‘It was now clear to Shevek, and he would have thought it folly to think otherwise, that his wretched years in his city, had all been part of his present great happiness, because they had led up to it, prepared him for it. Everything that had happened to him was part of what was happening to him now.’Lately, before I read this book, I’ve been explaining the last 33 years of my life that way. This is the time when I felt like writing for le Guin is not just hard work, when she is writing about love. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: This review can also be found on my blog,Cait's Corner!Shhhh! Do you hear that? It's the horrible screams of your money, doomed to spend the rest of their lives with the shame of having been used to purchase this book, and my poor ten dollars are among them. In order to keep your money from the same sad fate, I have quite a few reasons why you should not buy this book, which turned out to be a huge disappointment:1.The WritingThroughout the whole novel her writing is extremely choppy and awkward; to me, it felt like Kate was having a veryyy hard time keeping her train of thought. And sadly, it's like that through the whole novel; Kate starts writing about one of Luce's time traveling experiences and has me mildly interested, but then she decides to shift gears because she feels like she needs to move on with the story, and does so with no literary grace. I put the book down several times and didn't read it again for hours because I just couldn't muddle through when she did that. Then to make things worse, I had to push myself just to get through the last half which I had hoped would be better, and that's never a good thing; it just really crawled along unbearably slowly for me. It was like finally getting to what you thought was the top of the mountain to find out that you aren't even a quarter of the way there yet. Then, there were quotes like this, that don't make any sense at all ( I also used this quote later on, that's how badly I got annoyed)\" at last\" he breathed into her, finding her lips\"you found me\"\"Always\"There are several problems with this; for one, Kate never says that they are still not totally lip-locked, so, apparently, they are talking to each other without ever removing their lips from one another.Just like this, except people, frozen in that position,talking.I, for one, think that that's very weird and in real life probably would sound like: \"ee ls\" \"oo foond e\" \"als\". I don't know about you, but that's not exactly light-the-candles-turn-down-the-lights romantic. Secondly, the whole breathing into her bit. Just try it, breathing out the words, \"at last\" (which is stupid sounding enough), and hell, if you're with your girl or your man try it while finding one another's lips and simultaneously breathing it down their throat, which I am going to assume is the only rational way you can breathe into somebody without being naked, and if you don't find any of that awkward, then, well, I don't know what to say to that. Get some help, maybe? I hope you can see though just ONE quote that a scene that was supposed to be romantic is actually a total fail when you break it down and really think about it. Don't get me wrong, this book is a nice improvement compared to her first two, but it's still too much purple prose and she has a lot sentences like: Luce did this. Then this. Then they made out here. The only really well-written scenes that I could find were the first and second time traveling scenes and actually had me going and interested, but then it just never really came back fully. Definitely not something I should have spent my money on.2.The Time TravelOh, God. This was literally so confusing. We don't even have an explanation about why she travels to the places she does until...oh......halfway through the freaking book. That is way too long to keep your readers in the dark about something that is an integral part of the novel. I felt like Kate threw the time travel in there because it HAD to be, not because she wanted it there, which resulted in time travel that hurt my head and quite painfully, too. Then, to add to the already massive time-travel migraine, Daniel would randomly pop in some random fact about how it's her destiny to do this, to create the loop, and that he doesn't know what his destiny is, and yet, he does (which made the book okay for about two seconds, because he's having an ACTUAL struggle, albeit slightly confusing, but a struggle, nonetheless). But then Kate would be like that's enough of that, and have Daniel go skipping away in a field of roses and daises while I'm screaming, WHAT DESTINY?! WHAT'S GOING ON! I kind of understand why Luce can't know, but we're thereadersfor Pete's sake, and I think it would have made the book a lot better if at least I knew what was happening. It would have added the suspense that was sorely needed. But then, destiny took a really dangerous, and seriously annoying turn. Whenever Daniel would get somewhere conveniently right after Luce left, or he would only remember meeting himself in the past at the stupidest moments, he just chalked it up to destiny!No. It doesn't make sense. Give us a reason and don't take the easy way out!Now, I would like to present some real life cases of where having an excuse like destiny never works.Case #1: What?! Your baby sister got run over by the insane ice cream man?! Why didn't you help her?; It was my destiny not to!*gets bitchslapped*Case #2: * I walk downstairs* \" mom, I'm not going to school today; I'm actually going to go to a party and get drunk because it's my destiny!*gets bitchslapped*The worse case; case #3: Girlfriend: \"I love you sooo much baby, you're my everything! Happy two year anniversary!\"Boyfriend: \" hey, girl, I'm sorry, but we just can't be together anymore\"Girlfriend: \"WHAAATTT?!? WHY!\"Boyfriend: \"It's not you, or me, it's destiny!\"* gets bitch-slapped and maybe shot*Do you see my point? Just because you're an angel doesn't mean you can just leave it to destiny! If you want to read a good book about time travel, you should check out Timeless. It's pretty much everything good about time travel that Passion isn't.3:What would amount to what I guess could be called a plotWhen I said plot, I lied. There is no plot. No suspense, no action, no nothing. This is how the book goes in a nutshell.Luce: I can't! But I must! But I can't!Other characters: Yes, you cant! Just leave it alone, Luce!Luce: But I must!Other characters: *groan*Daniel: I must find MY Luce! But, oh, look, there's a different Luce! I can't fall in love with that one! I can't! But I want to! But I can't! *paces for apparently weeks, months, days, he doesn't really know*Cam: 'supLuce: hey, I just befriended a weird gargoyle named Bill! I'm going to not trust my instincts and let him come with me!Bill: heh heh I have a big secret, but Luce doesn't know that so shhhhhh.Luce: oh...wow....look at all of these me's. I'm a bitch. ( I actually clap). But it's whatevs, I'm going to take control of their bodies and make out with Daniel! (I groan)Daniel: YumBill: I'M GAY! Ohh...wait....wrong secret. Nevermind.Luce: I'm going to kill my spirit! I must!Bill: Yes you must!Luce: But I can't!Me and Bill: *groan*Cam: *makes the book interesting for three pages*Bill: I'm Satan! Muahahahaha! *hack*Luce: I'll never give in to you! Ever!* I actually start getting interested for a couple pages* until.....\" at last\" he breathed into her, finding her lips\"you found me\"\"Always\"Me: AHHHHHH EAHROEIA;REUIARHOWEI NOOOO!*epilogue giving Kate an excuse to write another book and jack millions more dollars off of people*May I just say, that Always is kind of like her always using the word \"destiny\". IT'S NOT THE ANSWER! She used that God-forsaken word about 15 times in the las couple of chapters as the answer for their love, and I just couldn't stand it!4.The charactersLong, unbearable story short, Luce and Daniel suck. Luce is as self absorbed as ever and just goes galavanting through time, wreaking who knows what kind of havoc, and decides to take control of her past selves' bodies so she can watch them burst into flames and know what it \"feels like\". Which, might I add, is advice from a gargoyle that hides from the angels who are the supposed good guys in the novel, which doesn't strike Luce as strange at all. If a gargoyle went up to me and said, \"hey, you've never met me before, but I'm a good guy, and I want you to go to the empire state building and jump off! Don't worry, you'll be fine!\" I would run away as fast as my legs could carry me, but not our Luce, because she's such a keeper. And by keep, I mean throw into a dumpster. She's a TSTL heroine at its finest. Then for a little, I felt like she was actually getting somewhere trying to find her answers, which included defying Daniel! *gasp!* But then Kate takes the easy way out and just falls back on \"destiny\" and \"eternal love\" *gag* (for any future writers out there, don't you dare do this. It will kill any sort of action and suspense you've built with one fell blow). Also, I didn't like some of her past selves and how different they were to her present self. Sure, they were born in different times, but I thought at least their personalities would be the same as the current Luce's. Sadly, most of them were even more pathetic and dumb like her chinese past; some don't even look like Luce at all. ugh. Coming back to her chinese past, I just don't understand how on earth she could have gotten away with killing the emperor; even with her wearing his clothes! I can't believe that they took such a second grade excuse as \"I'm sick so my voice sounds funky but I'm totes him\" It's not like I could go into the white house, stuff Obama in a closet, wear his suit, and get away with it! People just aren't that dumb, so don't make them sound that way. Luce also gets the top prize for most controlling, obsessive girlfriend I've ever read. In one scene, she is literallyjealous of the very ground that a past Daniel is walking on. Oh my God, Luce! If you're that jealous just go lick Daniel's toes or something! Will really show that dirt!Here you go, Luce! Maybe you can use it to scoop up some of that dirt!And Daniel is the worst tortured soul character I've ever had the pain of reading. Sure, there were some points that might have slightly poked at my heart-strings, but those were very few and far between. He kept important things from us and from Luce, which made me dislike him even more than I already did. I reallywantedto be let in on some things that he wouldn't say from Luce's perspective, but he never does. I know Luce would burst into flames if she knew, but it's not like if I read it I'm going to spontaneously combust, and neither is Daniel. It's always just Luce, Luce, Luce, death, Luce, Luce, jumping off cliffs, Luce, Luce. There's rarely any real development going on with him, which made his chapters the hardest to read. I know Luce's an idiot, but at least she's doing something, unlike Daniel, who seems to be only capable of watching himself. Can I just say, narcissist much? And the part in Heaven where Daniel goes up to God and says hey, I'll let you have Luce die and die and die for thousands of years because out love is just so true! Woah woah woah, Daniel, hold on a second. Did you ever ASK the first-ever Luce if that's what she would have wanted? To have excruciatingly painful deaths for the rest of her reincarnated existence? No. The douchebag. You don't make a decision like that without asking the person it's going to effect! Let me teach Daniel a lesson that he should have learned a loooong time ago. In life, people that you love most whether they're you're husband/wife, family, or friend, and that you can't possibly live without are going to die, no matter how much you don't want them to. And then to not have the guts to go \" I just need to let her go because I love her\" makes him look like a pussy. To add onto that he makes Luce suffer through not just the pain of death with his choice, but all of the family and friends that cared for her for however long she lived and now have to live with that ache of losing a loved one for the rest of their lives is just.... totally selfish, uncaring, and so centered on himself with the boo hoo I want Luce I can't live without her that I seriously, if I ever saw him, would punch him in the face. That is such a big no-no that I don't know how God didn't smite him where he stood for being so selfish.Did anyone else find it, oh....I don't know.....strangethat Daniel was magically able to change his body form to look asian, mexicanandwhite? Unless angels are the best plastic surgeons around and were somehow able to change his eye shape and color, skin color, height, and just general body form when we have only developed the technology for any kind of body-altering plastic surgery within the last 60 or so years, I don't see how any of it was remotely possible. And if it somehow was, I'm pretty sure one thing didn't change from its small size, and if you can guess what it is; you get a silver star. Hint, hint, it rhymes with chick. And if you still can't guess then either you're slow or I've got a dirty mind..Probably the latter ;)I was very upset by something else, as well. Cam was only in about twenty pages of the book! He was the best character for me in this whole novel and he only ever made very short, cameo, appearances. Even then, Daniel was trying to avoid him at all costs when he did pop up, so he barely talks at all in this novel. She essentially destroys his character and turns him into this:Hey, I'm Cam, I'm cool. Look at me! I'm leaning against a tree!Hey look I'm leaning against a house!Hey, I'm getting married! But awwww, I didn't!Hey, guess what I'm doing again? Leaning against a house!And it's kind of sad, because he was still my favorite character in the whole book even with the character degradation. He was the only one, when he did sparsely talk, that actually made a slight amount of sense.Oh, and the whole twist about him being Daniel's brother? What the hell was that? Kate never really even explained it well! She just said; hey, they're brothers, and left us readers to fend for ourselves. When she did try to explain she used about three teeny tiny paragraphs on the whole brotherhood reveal and then had two really short scenes where they were still all lovey dovey bromance with each other, thinking that that would be enough, but it wasn't. It definitely wasn't. She also doesn't spend any time with their backstory, how they were together in heaven, zilch, zero, nada. Come on, Kate! If you're not going to spend time on something that's as big of a deal as you're trying to make it (even though ALL angels are related but whatever), don't even try it!And Bill! I know some people say that they liked him and he was a good surprise, but, again, she never explained any of his behavior: the turning into other people, only being visible to Luce, etc. Luce never questions him or his motives, which made him very frustrating especially when we find out thathe's satan!I mean what?! His attitude, especially being a seamstress doesn't match what I thought of him at all! He's like agay satan!\"Hey, while I'm saying all of my evil plans to you, you should totally not go with that outfit at all, it soooo clashes\" No. I know he's not supposed to reveal his full personality to Luce, but Kate doesn't even give us any hints to who he is, so it's such a 360 turnaround that I couldn't fully get into it. I knew he was a bad guythatmuch was obvious, but did she have to make that big of a jump? And his \"big reaveal?\" gah. The only thing big about that was the enormity in the fail of describing him. It didn't make me scared, or give me any kind of shivers, I actually giggled a little bit. Poor guy probably became who he was because nobody up in heaven would produce his newest line of togas/robes because of how butt-ugly he was. You know those fashion types, always holding a grudge.I kind of agree with God, it IS a little much.And all of the other smaller characters in each of her past lives? They were very cookie-cutter characters. They didn't make me feel anything, they were never memorable; she didn't describe them well at all. If anything, they detracted from Luce's past lives. I know that she didn't spend a lot of time in each past, but if she has made those small characters better, I think I would have gotten more involved in the novel than I actually did. They just weren't good character foils due to, again, the lack of description. And don't even get me started on Miles. I can see that \"lurve\" triangle coming from a mile away, even though he was only in about two pages of the book. And Lilith? I say to her,\" go , girl!\" Yes, Kate screwed up how Lilith ACTUALLY I guess you could say \"broke up with Adam\", but she was the only one with enough of a spine to actually defy the angels. Do I actually see a little bit of feminism, here? Honestly, that's what I think Luce should have done with Daniel in the first place; just curse his ass! But we all know that that didn't happen and now we're stuck with lots more lust. *sigh*Oh, and I thought that it was justhilariousthat we pretty much read over four-hundred pages of \"love\", but we still never get any answers! Really I was just giggling because nothing is ever explained, ever. The whole reason I stuck around the last hundred pages was to see the scene when Daniel and Luce first met but we never get to see that! Luce would repeatedlycomplaintalk about how she didn't know why Daniel loved her so much. I mean, what is the more obvious solution to that then justgo back to the freaking beginning!All of this makes me wonder the million-dollar question: what exactly was the point of this book? All we read is her running around time with no real sense. Whoop-de-doo, Kate. I really needed to know about fashionistas, spontaneous combustion, and depressed people. Just get to the meat of the story and stop skirting around the edges!But I digress.So anyways, in the end, I was really hoping that this book would be better than it was, but it turned out to be a disappointment for me.Why did I rate it two stars instead of one? I guess there were still moments that were cute and touching like the funeral and cliff scenes, but you had to dig so hard for them through the rest of the crap that when they did finally pop up, they weren't as heartfelt anymore. Whether or not you believe me, this was my favorite of the whole series; I was honestly hoping that it would turn out better than it did. I am going to read Rapture because of the big difference between her first and third book; who knows, maybe I will even rate the next one three stars since it IS the last book and she will, whether she wants to or not, have to give us all of the answers I've been waiting for.Imagine the huge dude as Kate and the the guy with the rain as me, the book buyer who got her money stolen. Poor me. Stupid Kate., error: This review can also be found on my blog,Cait's Corner!Shhhh! Do you hear that?

Just try it, breathing out the words, \"at last\" (which is stupid sounding enough), and hell, if you're with your girl or your man try it while finding one another's lips and simultaneously breathing it down their throat, which I am going to assume is the only rational way you can breathe into somebody without being naked, and if you don't find any of that awkward, then, well, I don't know what to say to that. Get some help, maybe? I hope you can see though just ONE quote that a scene that was supposed to be romantic is actually a total fail when you break it down and really think about it. Don't get me wrong, this book is a nice improvement compared to her first two, but it's still too much purple prose and she has a lot sentences like: Luce did this. Then this.

Then, to add to the already massive time-travel migraine, Daniel would randomly pop in some random fact about how it's her destiny to do this, to create the loop, and that he doesn't know what his destiny is, and yet, he does (which made the book okay for about two seconds, because he's having an ACTUAL struggle, albeit slightly confusing, but a struggle, nonetheless). But then Kate would be like that's enough of that, and have Daniel go skipping away in a field of roses and daises while I'm screaming, WHAT DESTINY?! WHAT'S GOING ON! I kind of understand why Luce can't know, but we're thereadersfor Pete's sake, and I think it would have made the book a lot better if at least I knew what was happening. It would have added the suspense that was sorely needed. But then, destiny took a really dangerous, and seriously annoying turn. Whenever Daniel would get somewhere conveniently right after Luce left, or he would only remember meeting himself in the past at the stupidest moments, he just chalked it up to destiny!No. It doesn't make sense. Give us a reason and don't take the easy way out!Now, I would like to present some real life cases of where having an excuse like destiny never works.Case #1: What?! Your baby sister got run over by the insane ice cream man?! Why didn't you help her?; It was my destiny not to!*gets bitchslapped*Case #2: * I walk downstairs* \" mom, I'm not going to school today; I'm actually going to go to a party and get drunk because it's my destiny!*gets bitchslapped*The worse case; case #3: Girlfriend: \"I love you sooo much baby, you're my everything! Happy two year anniversary!\"Boyfriend: \" hey, girl, I'm sorry, but we just can't be together anymore\"Girlfriend: \"WHAAATTT?!? WHY!\"Boyfriend: \"It's not you, or me, it's destiny!\"* gets bitch-slapped and maybe shot*Do you see my point? Just because you're an angel doesn't mean you can just leave it to destiny! If you want to read a good book about time travel, you should check out Timeless. It's pretty much everything good about time travel that Passion isn't.3:What would amount to what I guess could be called a plotWhen I said plot, I lied. There is no plot. No suspense, no action, no nothing. This is how the book goes in a nutshell.Luce: I can't! But I must! But I can't!Other characters: Yes, you cant! Just leave it alone, Luce!Luce: But I must!Other characters: *groan*Daniel: I must find MY Luce! But, oh, look, there's a different Luce! I can't fall in love with that one! I can't! But I want to! But I can't! *paces for apparently weeks, months, days, he doesn't really know*Cam: 'supLuce: hey, I just befriended a weird gargoyle named Bill! I'm going to not trust my instincts and let him come with me!Bill: heh heh I have a big secret, but Luce doesn't know that so shhhhhh.Luce: oh...wow....look at all of these me's. I'm a bitch. ( I actually clap). But it's whatevs, I'm going to take control of their bodies and make out with Daniel! (I groan)Daniel: YumBill: I'M GAY! Ohh...wait....wrong secret. Nevermind.Luce: I'm going to kill my spirit! I must!Bill: Yes you must!Luce: But I can't!Me and Bill: *groan*Cam: *makes the book interesting for three pages*Bill: I'm Satan! Muahahahaha! *hack*Luce: I'll never give in to you! Ever!* I actually start getting interested for a couple pages* until.....\" at last\" he breathed into her, finding her lips\"you found me\"\"Always\"Me: AHHHHHH EAHROEIA;REUIARHOWEI NOOOO!*epilogue giving Kate an excuse to write another book and jack millions more dollars off of people*May I just say, that Always is kind of like her always using the word \"destiny\". IT'S NOT THE ANSWER! She used that God-forsaken word about 15 times in the las couple of chapters as the answer for their love, and I just couldn't stand it!4.The charactersLong, unbearable story short, Luce and Daniel suck. Luce is as self absorbed as ever and just goes galavanting through time, wreaking who knows what kind of havoc, and decides to take control of her past selves' bodies so she can watch them burst into flames and know what it \"feels like\". Which, might I add, is advice from a gargoyle that hides from the angels who are the supposed good guys in the novel, which doesn't strike Luce as strange at all. If a gargoyle went up to me and said, \"hey, you've never met me before, but I'm a good guy, and I want you to go to the empire state building and jump off! Don't worry, you'll be fine!\" I would run away as fast as my legs could carry me, but not our Luce, because she's such a keeper. And by keep, I mean throw into a dumpster. She's a TSTL heroine at its finest. Then for a little, I felt like she was actually getting somewhere trying to find her answers, which included defying Daniel! *gasp!* But then Kate takes the easy way out and just falls back on \"destiny\" and \"eternal love\" *gag* (for any future writers out there, don't you dare do this. It will kill any sort of action and suspense you've built with one fell blow). Also, I didn't like some of her past selves and how different they were to her present self. Sure, they were born in different times, but I thought at least their personalities would be the same as the current Luce's. Sadly, most of them were even more pathetic and dumb like her chinese past; some don't even look like Luce at all. ugh. Coming back to her chinese past, I just don't understand how on earth she could have gotten away with killing the emperor; even with her wearing his clothes! I can't believe that they took such a second grade excuse as \"I'm sick so my voice sounds funky but I'm totes him\" It's not like I could go into the white house, stuff Obama in a closet, wear his suit, and get away with it! People just aren't that dumb, so don't make them sound that way. Luce also gets the top prize for most controlling, obsessive girlfriend I've ever read. In one scene, she is literallyjealous of the very ground that a past Daniel is walking on. Oh my God, Luce! If you're that jealous just go lick Daniel's toes or something! Will really show that dirt!Here you go, Luce! Maybe you can use it to scoop up some of that dirt!And Daniel is the worst tortured soul character I've ever had the pain of reading. Sure, there were some points that might have slightly poked at my heart-strings, but those were very few and far between. He kept important things from us and from Luce, which made me dislike him even more than I already did. I reallywantedto be let in on some things that he wouldn't say from Luce's perspective, but he never does. I know Luce would burst into flames if she knew, but it's not like if I read it I'm going to spontaneously combust, and neither is Daniel. It's always just Luce, Luce, Luce, death, Luce, Luce, jumping off cliffs, Luce, Luce. There's rarely any real development going on with him, which made his chapters the hardest to read. I know Luce's an idiot, but at least she's doing something, unlike Daniel, who seems to be only capable of watching himself. Can I just say, narcissist much? And the part in Heaven where Daniel goes up to God and says hey, I'll let you have Luce die and die and die for thousands of years because out love is just so true! Woah woah woah, Daniel, hold on a second. Did you ever ASK the first-ever Luce if that's what she would have wanted? To have excruciatingly painful deaths for the rest of her reincarnated existence? No. The douchebag. You don't make a decision like that without asking the person it's going to effect! Let me teach Daniel a lesson that he should have learned a loooong time ago. In life, people that you love most whether they're you're husband/wife, family, or friend, and that you can't possibly live without are going to die, no matter how much you don't want them to. And then to not have the guts to go \" I just need to let her go because I love her\" makes him look like a pussy. To add onto that he makes Luce suffer through not just the pain of death with his choice, but all of the family and friends that cared for her for however long she lived and now have to live with that ache of losing a loved one for the rest of their lives is just.... totally selfish, uncaring, and so centered on himself with the boo hoo I want Luce I can't live without her that I seriously, if I ever saw him, would punch him in the face. That is such a big no-no that I don't know how God didn't smite him where he stood for being so selfish.Did anyone else find it, oh....I don't know.....strangethat Daniel was magically able to change his body form to look asian, mexicanandwhite? Unless angels are the best plastic surgeons around and were somehow able to change his eye shape and color, skin color, height, and just general body form when we have only developed the technology for any kind of body-altering plastic surgery within the last 60 or so years, I don't see how any of it was remotely possible. And if it somehow was, I'm pretty sure one thing didn't change from its small size, and if you can guess what it is; you get a silver star. Hint, hint, it rhymes with chick. And if you still can't guess then either you're slow or I've got a dirty mind..Probably the latter ;)I was very upset by something else, as well. Cam was only in about twenty pages of the book! He was the best character for me in this whole novel and he only ever made very short, cameo, appearances. Even then, Daniel was trying to avoid him at all costs when he did pop up, so he barely talks at all in this novel. She essentially destroys his character and turns him into this:Hey, I'm Cam, I'm cool. Look at me! I'm leaning against a tree!Hey look I'm leaning against a house!Hey, I'm getting married! But awwww, I didn't!Hey, guess what I'm doing again? Leaning against a house!And it's kind of sad, because he was still my favorite character in the whole book even with the character degradation. He was the only one, when he did sparsely talk, that actually made a slight amount of sense.Oh, and the whole twist about him being Daniel's brother? What the hell was that? Kate never really even explained it well! She just said; hey, they're brothers, and left us readers to fend for ourselves. When she did try to explain she used about three teeny tiny paragraphs on the whole brotherhood reveal and then had two really short scenes where they were still all lovey dovey bromance with each other, thinking that that would be enough, but it wasn't. It definitely wasn't. She also doesn't spend any time with their backstory, how they were together in heaven, zilch, zero, nada. Come on, Kate! If you're not going to spend time on something that's as big of a deal as you're trying to make it (even though ALL angels are related but whatever), don't even try it!And Bill! I know some people say that they liked him and he was a good surprise, but, again, she never explained any of his behavior: the turning into other people, only being visible to Luce, etc. Luce never questions him or his motives, which made him very frustrating especially when we find out thathe's satan!I mean what?! His attitude, especially being a seamstress doesn't match what I thought of him at all! He's like agay satan!\"Hey, while I'm saying all of my evil plans to you, you should totally not go with that outfit at all, it soooo clashes\" No. I know he's not supposed to reveal his full personality to Luce, but Kate doesn't even give us any hints to who he is, so it's such a 360 turnaround that I couldn't fully get into it. I knew he was a bad guythatmuch was obvious, but did she have to make that big of a jump? And his \"big reaveal?\" gah. The only thing big about that was the enormity in the fail of describing him. It didn't make me scared, or give me any kind of shivers, I actually giggled a little bit. Poor guy probably became who he was because nobody up in heaven would produce his newest line of togas/robes because of how butt-ugly he was. You know those fashion types, always holding a grudge.I kind of agree with God, it IS a little much.And all of the other smaller characters in each of her past lives? They were very cookie-cutter characters. They didn't make me feel anything, they were never memorable; she didn't describe them well at all. If anything, they detracted from Luce's past lives. I know that she didn't spend a lot of time in each past, but if she has made those small characters better, I think I would have gotten more involved in the novel than I actually did. They just weren't good character foils due to, again, the lack of description. And don't even get me started on Miles. I can see that \"lurve\" triangle coming from a mile away, even though he was only in about two pages of the book. And Lilith? I say to her,\" go , girl!\" Yes, Kate screwed up how Lilith ACTUALLY I guess you could say \"broke up with Adam\", but she was the only one with enough of a spine to actually defy the angels. Do I actually see a little bit of feminism, here? Honestly, that's what I think Luce should have done with Daniel in the first place; just curse his ass! But we all know that that didn't happen and now we're stuck with lots more lust. *sigh*Oh, and I thought that it was justhilariousthat we pretty much read over four-hundred pages of \"love\", but we still never get any answers! Really I was just giggling because nothing is ever explained, ever. The whole reason I stuck around the last hundred pages was to see the scene when Daniel and Luce first met but we never get to see that! Luce would repeatedlycomplaintalk about how she didn't know why Daniel loved her so much. I mean, what is the more obvious solution to that then justgo back to the freaking beginning!All of this makes me wonder the million-dollar question: what exactly was the point of this book? All we read is her running around time with no real sense. Whoop-de-doo, Kate. I really needed to know about fashionistas, spontaneous combustion, and depressed people. Just get to the meat of the story and stop skirting around the edges!But I digress.So anyways, in the end, I was really hoping that this book would be better than it was, but it turned out to be a disappointment for me.Why did I rate it two stars instead of one? I guess there were still moments that were cute and touching like the funeral and cliff scenes, but you had to dig so hard for them through the rest of the crap that when they did finally pop up, they weren't as heartfelt anymore. Whether or not you believe me, this was my favorite of the whole series; I was honestly hoping that it would turn out better than it did. I am going to read Rapture because of the big difference between her first and third book; who knows, maybe I will even rate the next one three stars since it IS the last book and she will, whether she wants to or not, have to give us all of the answers I've been waiting for.Imagine the huge dude as Kate and the the guy with the rain as me, the book buyer who got her money stolen. Poor me. Stupid Kate. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: **SOME SPOILERS**Sigh... OK, ready for this?So, as you may know, the Fallen series is definitely not one of my favorites-- but I am inexplicably drawn to them like a moth to a flame, or a fat guy to a doughnut-- and I keep reading, in the vain hope that someday, somehow I will finally understand what was going through LK's head when she wrote these books...so, here we go:~Brief Summary~At the end of the last book, Luce had had enough of absolutely no one telling her what the heck was going on with the curse between her and Daniel (OK, we were ALL fed up with not knowing what was going on) so at the last moment she peaced-out by stepping into an Announcer and back into her past lives to figure things out on her own. Passion follows Luce's \"Quest\" to find out why she and Daniel are cursed, so that she can break it. Along the way, she meets her new little Disney-sidekick Bill, who helps her while adding comic relief throughout. Luce and Bill travel from Moscow during WWII to England in the mid-1800's, to Versailles, to the Globe Theater during Shakespeare's time, to the Mayan civilization, all the way back to ancient Egypt. Meanwhile, Daniel goes back in time to try and find Luce and make sure she doesn'teff things upalter things permanently...~Review~When I started getting into Passion, I was thinking, hey! So far, this isn't so bad! Not nearly as painful and cringe-inducing as Torment! The plot was moving along, there was a fun, new secondary character, we finally got to see Daniel's point of view and he wasn't such a tremendous butt-face, and even 2-D, cardboard Luce seemed to take on some life... and THEN there was the ending.Oh good lord, the ending.But before I get all down on the Fallen books again, let me say what I did like about Passion. And also, let me just state for the record, that this is definitely the best book in the series so far. (Not sure that's saying much, butwhatevs.)Alrighty, let's do this in good old-fashioned bullet points, shall we?* First, the prologue was mysterious and downright creepy. We realize that the Elders still exist (even though they fell out of the plot in the second book and then disappear again for the rest of this book) and they are now teaming up with the Outcasts to get their hands on Luce.* Second, LK has FINALLY picked up the pace. The story line, while not heart-stoppingly amazing, was at least not as painfully put-you-in-a-coma slow as the first two books.* Third, we finally get to see things from Daniel's point of view. Up to this point he's been a self-centered, irritating, nasty, chauvinistic jerk-wad who you want to give a nice, swift kick in the crotch. Here we get to see another side of him-- awesome! Now he has two sides ;)* I personally liked snarky, fun, quirky, potentially gay, admittedly cheesy Bill-- um, that is, until the end. Don't worry-- that's not really a spoiler-- if you have half a teaspoon of brains, you have a pretty good idea from the get-go who \"Bill\" actually is... unless you're Luce Price. Yeeeah, she's definitely not known for her ability to put two and two together...But let's not get TOO carried away: there were definitely things about this book that left me with an unpleasant eye-twitch and something reminiscent of a bad hangover-- such as:* We are still no closer to understanding WHY Luce and Daniel \"love\" each other-- or WHY they fell in love in the first place. Classic case here of telling and not showing-- we're told a bazillion times that Luce loves Daniel and Daniel loves Luce, but gosh darn it, we sure haven't seen anything yet beyond a bunch of goo-goo eyed stares and passionate lip-locking. Sorry, but if you want Me the Reader to believe in this magical, eternal bond of love between the two main characters, you need to give me something more to base it on than teenage sighs and making out.FAIL #1.* To elaborate on my last point, when a \"CERTAIN SOMEONE\" asks Luce exactly why she loves Daniel so much, here is the response we get: \"A million reasons. I just do.\" (p. 388)I just do??REALLY?? So... you're telling me that after 1200+ PAGES this is the best explanation we get for why Luce loves Daniel?? She just does? So basically... they love each other--because they love each other. **slaps forehead in TOTAL frustration**FAIL #2.* As if the plot wasn't confusing enough, now we have TIME TRAVEL thrown into the mix. And multiple versions of the main characters. AND other major characters and plot elements that have just completely disappeared altogether with no explanation for why they're no longer there. But the time travel was the worst-- it was just one big, inconsistent mess that leaves you staring blankly into the space-time continuum. Now, I'm no Stephen Hawking, but I'm pretty darned sure this isn't how time travel goes down. Seriously, by the last few chapters I was so freaking confused I had to pop a couple Tylenol PM just so that I wasn't up all night racking my brains over what the hell had just happened. And considering that this series already has more plot holes than I can count on fingers and toes, time travel just didn't seem like a really smart move to me.FAIL #3.* Let's talk about Luce Price for a minute. Will Luce EVER learn that she has zero instinct or ability to read people? How many times now has her gullible butt been duped because she blindly skips after the bad guy like he's the freaking Pied Piper? She can passquantum physicsbut she thinks following a creepy gargoyle who won't let anyone but her see him is a GOOD idea?? EARTH TO LUCE!! Stay away from strangers trying to lure you to your death! They're bad-news bears, K?? Really, if she's going to be THIS stupid over and over again, do Ireallyeven care at this point what happens to her? Not to mention that, up to this point, Luce's sole existence is based on being head-over-heels in love with Daniel.That's it.End of story. The girl has no other purpose.Luce Price= FAIL #4.* The writing style, while somewhat better, is still pretty sloppy, confusing, and all over the place. (I SWEAR I'm trying to not be a total jerk here! It IS better than the first two! There IS improvement!!) But still, the transitions between each chapter and each new time period visited are about as graceful as falling down a flight of stairs. Also, maybe an OUTLINE would have helped before just taking the \"write-as-you-go\" approach and then conveniently taking the easy way out with pretty much EVERY aspect of the plot. I'm not expecting this to be Shakespeare, but I would appreciate at least being able to follow some remotely logical series of events...FAIL #5.* Speaking of which! Did you know that Luce knew SHAKESPEARE in another lifetime and SHE'S the reason why the Globe Theater burned down?? Hey! Neither did I!! Oh Lord, the history re-writing in this book just cracks me up...Slightly Amusing FAIL #6.* Back to that \"CERTAIN SOMEONE,\" all I can say is-- Wow. Congrats LK, on managing to take theevilest being of all timeand turn him into a cliche villain about as scary and intimidating as one of those 1920's silent-film guys-- you know, the one with the monocle and top hat? He's all, MUAHAHAHA!!! Then cue a lot ofeeveellpacing back and forth as heinfo dumpsexplains hiseeveellplans... (which, by the by, ALSO makeNO SENSE.) Are you kidding me?FAIL #7.* At the end of this book-- guess what?We STILL have NO IDEA what the EFF is going on.No joke! NOTHING is ever explained, and the ending contained about 297 plot holes. NO ONE has a motive in this series, NOTHING is ever given a logical explanation, and everything is all chalked up to DESTINY. Isn't this what we call a cop-out? Why yes, yes it is! The worst of it is, the book was set up to make it sound like we would FINALLY get some answers to major questions, and then the last few chapters just made no sense at all. Is this some kind of joke Ms. Kate?? Because after a thousand plus pages it just isn't funny anymore. What exactly was the POINT of Luce's \"Quest\"? What was she trying to find? So far, the whole plot is completely meaningless to the reader. I went back and tried to re-read whole sections thinking I must have missed something, and I'm STILL totally lost. I honestly want to believe that there is more to this plot and these characters than meets the eye-- but at this point, I'm not holding my breath.FAIL #8.* This was literally my favorite line in the whole book: \"Finally, things were beginning to make sense.\" (p. 400) Really? They ARE?? Could've fooled me! I'm seriously going to have a brain aneurism if I spend one more minute trying to make sense of this story. This is honest-to-goodness THE most convoluted mess of a plot I have ever read! Does theauthoreven know what's going on here?? But yeah, I LOVED that line. It made me chuckle.FAIL #9.* Random question: Does the kiss you've been dreaming about your whole life include knocking your teeth into somebody else's? No? Huh, me neither. Just wondering.FAIL #10.* We honestly can't get though a Fallen book without someone \"waggling\" or \"wagging\" their eyebrows-- seriously LK, why? How many people actually \"waggle\" their eyebrows on a regular basis? Are people going to look at me all crazy if I attempt this? Why is eyebrow-waggling so necessary to this story? I am so dang confused.FAIL #11.* What the hell happened to Trevor? Remember, the poor sap who spontaneously-combusted thanks to Luce back in Book 1? Like, shouldn't someone in the story sort of, you know,carethat some kid ended up as a human tiki torch?? If LK thought we were all just going to conveniently forget about Trevor's tragic demise as quickly as brain-dead Luce just because heart-throb Daniel steps onto the scene, she was sorely mistaken. Way to totally ignore the fact that your main character caused someone toburst into flamesLauren, might've been a good idea to tie up loose ends with that unfortunate event instead of conveniently dropping it out of the plot altogether...FAIL #12So, all in all, another utterly confusing masterpiece! Maybe it's just me, but there is precious little that makes sense in this series. If you have read these books and have figured out what the heck is going on, please let me know. I would greatly appreciate it. Otherwise, I'm still entertained. AND this book was, despite everything, still better than the first two. Sorry, that's all I've got.**LIKE THIS REVIEW??**See more excessive ranting forRapture, the finale to the Fallen series! :D~Lea @LC's Adventures in Libraryland, error: **SOME SPOILERS**Sigh...

I'm not expecting this to be Shakespeare, but I would appreciate at least being able to follow some remotely logical series of events...FAIL #5.* Speaking of which! Did you know that Luce knew SHAKESPEARE in another lifetime and SHE'S the reason why the Globe Theater burned down?? Hey! Neither did I!! Oh Lord, the history re-writing in this book just cracks me up...Slightly Amusing FAIL #6.* Back to that \"CERTAIN SOMEONE,\" all I can say is-- Wow. Congrats LK, on managing to take theevilest being of all timeand turn him into a cliche villain about as scary and intimidating as one of those 1920's silent-film guys-- you know, the one with the monocle and top hat? He's all, MUAHAHAHA!!! Then cue a lot ofeeveellpacing back and forth as heinfo dumpsexplains hiseeveellplans... (which, by the by, ALSO makeNO SENSE.) Are you kidding me?FAIL #7.* At the end of this book-- guess what?We STILL have NO IDEA what the EFF is going on.No joke! NOTHING is ever explained, and the ending contained about 297 plot holes. NO ONE has a motive in this series, NOTHING is ever given a logical explanation, and everything is all chalked up to DESTINY. Isn't this what we call a cop-out? Why yes, yes it is! The worst of it is, the book was set up to make it sound like we would FINALLY get some answers to major questions, and then the last few chapters just made no sense at all. Is this some kind of joke Ms. Kate?? Because after a thousand plus pages it just isn't funny anymore. What exactly was the POINT of Luce's \"Quest\"? What was she trying to find? So far, the whole plot is completely meaningless to the reader. I went back and tried to re-read whole sections thinking I must have missed something, and I'm STILL totally lost. I honestly want to believe that there is more to this plot and these characters than meets the eye-- but at this point, I'm not holding my breath.FAIL #8.* This was literally my favorite line in the whole book: \"Finally, things were beginning to make sense.\" (p. 400) Really? They ARE?? Could've fooled me! I'm seriously going to have a brain aneurism if I spend one more minute trying to make sense of this story. This is honest-to-goodness THE most convoluted mess of a plot I have ever read! Does theauthoreven know what's going on here?? But yeah, I LOVED that line. It made me chuckle.FAIL #9.* Random question: Does the kiss you've been dreaming about your whole life include knocking your teeth into somebody else's? No? Huh, me neither. Just wondering.FAIL #10.* We honestly can't get though a Fallen book without someone \"waggling\" or \"wagging\" their eyebrows-- seriously LK, why? How many people actually \"waggle\" their eyebrows on a regular basis? Are people going to look at me all crazy if I attempt this? Why is eyebrow-waggling so necessary to this story? I am so dang confused.FAIL #11.* What the hell happened to Trevor? Remember, the poor sap who spontaneously-combusted thanks to Luce back in Book 1? Like, shouldn't someone in the story sort of, you know,carethat some kid ended up as a human tiki torch?? If LK thought we were all just going to conveniently forget about Trevor's tragic demise as quickly as brain-dead Luce just because heart-throb Daniel steps onto the scene, she was sorely mistaken. Way to totally ignore the fact that your main character caused someone toburst into flamesLauren, might've been a good idea to tie up loose ends with that unfortunate event instead of conveniently dropping it out of the plot altogether...FAIL #12So, all in all, another utterly confusing masterpiece! Maybe it's just me, but there is precious little that makes sense in this series. If you have read these books and have figured out what the heck is going on, please let me know. I would greatly appreciate it. Otherwise, I'm still entertained. AND this book was, despite everything, still better than the first two. Sorry, that's all I've got.**LIKE THIS REVIEW??**See more excessive ranting forRapture, the finale to the Fallen series! :D~Lea @LC's Adventures in Libraryland --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: \"Lex malla, lex nulla.A bad law is no law.\"This could be one of the hardest reviews I’ve ever written and that’s just because my feelings and thoughts are all over the place and I know, no matter how many days pass, I won’t be able to have a clear response so bear with me.This is going to be a mess.As usual, there were things I liked and things I didn’t. In this particular case, I don’t know if everything I loved can outweigh what I disliked. This is the first time I had to call two of my friends to ask them if I was being neutral enough and this is the result.If at this point y’all don’t know this is not a spoiler free blog and therefore my reviews contain untagged spoilers, then I don’t know what you guys are up to. Read at your own risk.Lady Midnight is the first book in what is going to be a trilogy named The Dark Artifices and in this first installment, we deal with the aftermath of the Dark War that, after 5 years, it still has a huge impact in the Shadowhunter world. We follow Emma Carstairs and Julian Blackthorn as they work together to discover who’s behind the murders of mundanes and faeries happening in Los Angeles.Now, I’m going to begin with what I actually liked about this book because I feel like I need to start with positive things.•I absolutely adored the Blackthorn dynamic. I really like this family a lot! I loved how close they are and how they manage all the situations they get themselves involved. I think they could’ve been written really poorly but I’m so happy with all of them. I love Julian and his strong sense of responsibility, I love Ty and his way of seeing things(I don’t know exactly his condition; it can be a grade of autism, though I don’t know if people can have just a bit of it or it can also be Asperger syndrome but I was glad to read about a character like that and that person being an actual active member of everything)and Livvy with her fierceness, Dru with her love for morbid topics and how protective she was of Tavvy and Tavvy being so young and cute and I just really loved them all. And Mark, who I actually got to know a bit in Bitter of Tongue, I grew to like him a lot in this book.•Dude, I fucking loved Cristina Mendoza Rosales. She was such a mature character and she gave me and a lot of people new perspectives and while she was a rule follower, she was ready for everything and understood there were things higher than law and I just fell for her so hard. I’m just happy she exists.•I loved reading about all characters and their cameos and it was a big fangirl moment for me. Jace actually seemed to have grown up a lot and reading about Izzy and Simon’s engagement party and Tessa and Jem, holy shit, I was soso happyand *sighs*so good.•Cristina and Mark are my new ship and I will sink with them. I’m so here for more of those two. You have no idea how much I ship them omg.And that was about it. If I end up reading the second book, when it comes out, it’ll be only for what I wrote above.Now comes the part where I rant about everything I actually hated so ifyou loved the book,you may want to stop reading this now.Boy, I was not pleased with A LOT of things and it made so sad. For 4 years since it was announced this trilogy was coming out and after we all met the characters when they were children, I was sold.I’m telling you, after City of Heavenly Fire, I was ready to take a break. Since 2010 I was reading CC’s books nonstop and I was exhausted. You all know these books got centuries worth of baggage and I was going to wait until The Dark Artifices had at least 2 books out, you know? And then these kids came into the picture and I couldn’t help it. I had to know what was going to be for them in the future.Enter Lady Midnight and just nah.Probably one of things I hated the most was how in-your-face was the whole romance between Emma and Julian because for years we were sold the idea of how unthinkable was a romance between parabatai and I expected so much and more from this book and I didn’t get it at all.I don’t know if I was misguided or maybe it was just me but I thought that,at least in this first book,Julian’s feelings were going to be unrequired. So color me surprise when it was not Julian who I first read having doubts about it but Emma.In the first fucking chapter.I was like whaaaat??? And from there the romance went downhill for me. It’s not the fact that Emma loved him too, no. It is just that there was not mystery. There was not seduction. CC did not play with the possibilities when we all were expecting being heartbroken and this impossible love for so many reasons and I did not get it. I’m not even talking about Emma and Julian having sex at the first opportunity but rather the notion of them thinking it was not going to affect their parabatai bond. It was how poorly it was handled. It was because the level of ridiculousness shocked the fuck out of me.I’d like to think I’m not the only one who feels that their romance was not only was rushed but also bad written and I just got this incredible feeling of being tricked and robbed. And while I wasn’t crazy for all the angst I knew it gotta exist because, hello parabatai in love, I was not expecting them got their feelings somewhat sorted out that quick. Sue me, I like to be seduced but nooo.Which leads me to the thing I hated the most…Are. You. Freaking. Kidding. Me? I knew, as soon as Julian was hurt and Emma put that iratze on him and shit worked amazingly, something was up. And what was it?Well, apparently when the pair of parabatai fall in love, their runes become even more powerful because….yeah, I guess romantic love is the most powerful thing in the world. Bullshit.If you ask me, two parabatai who are siblings, have more chances of being all powerful because a) they share blood b) they grew up together c) parabatai bond. To me, that’s a killer combinationif you’re following the CC’s logic.But nope, romantic love y’all.And the reason why parabatai can’t be romantically together? They become all magic powerful and go Hercules on everyone around them. Like, killing everyone and going power crazy.How convenient that was never mentioned.A friend of mine told me she read something about a Lightwood being in love with their parabatai and the result was mortal to them back before The Infernal Devices and that’s it. And now Lady Midnight.I just hate how everything was left out, how there was no information about this until now. How. Fucking. Convenient.It’s feels like when someone tells you“oops, you should have read the fine print”because I don’t remember reading anything in the Codex about such thing. And one would think something so important would’ve been included in the Codex no matter how \"in the shadows\" that shit had to stay. Actually, the parabatai part in the Codex was absurdly short and most of it was the vow.Something so important and sacred for this world has so little information. How convenient. Next thing we’ll know it’s a way to break the parabatai bond without any of them being dead because the power of true love.I’m frustrated and mad. How dare CC to take such an already established concept, a concept we all already know about and it’s so important and twist it to her better convenience? Just no. How disrespectful of her.And some of you may say “but they’re her books and she can do what she wants…” yes but that’s not how shit goes and we all know it. It’s really not fair to change the rules at this point just because it’s easier that way.And the way Emma broke things with Julian? Fuck.Why does she have to involve Mark? Doesn’t she realize Julian is going to end up hating Mark and therefore the brothers are going to be divided and that’s going to divide the siblings and it’s going to hurt everyone but mostly Julian? Doesn’t she realize how selfish that decision was? Couldn’t she just break things with Julian and try to “date” someone else? Why create unnecessary drama?Emma spent the whole book saying and proving she cares a great deal about Julian, duh she loves him, but she just doesn’t think about the consequences. She doesn’t think about Mark having to deal with Julian’s feelings, too.She doesn’t think about Mark having small feeling for Cristina. She doesn’t think about her friend liking Mark, too. She doesn’t stop to think about anything and yes, you may tell me “but Laura, she didn’t force him\" and you’re right! But as soon as she said it was to help Julian, we all know Mark was game and that isn’t fair.Now, let’s leave Emma and Julian aside for a while and let’s talk about the main villain in this book.So, Malcom Fade, High Warlock of Los Angeles. Someone so in love with someone, so hurt by betrayal and so powerful he managed to kill a lot of people and form a cult for years in order to bring back to life his old love.I just didn’t feel it. I don’t know if it was because we didn’t know Malcom that much so the fact that he turned out being the bad guy, while surprising, didn’t evoke a lot of things to me. I mean, yeah, he turned outhatingthe kids he saw grow and poor kids, you know? But that was it.Everything about this plot was weak and I get that Emma’s parents ended up being just meaningless deaths and that’s something she will have to deal with but I just was not impressed by Malcom trying to rise Anabel from the dead. I feel like it was such a hollow thing. Maybe because I’m used to bad guys trying to destroy everything and conquer the world that here came this guy and he only wanted to be with his beloved one again and some of the Fair Folk helping him, it still didn’t work out in my opinion. It was something so bizarre like this kid Christopher Herondale.Fuck me sideways, I thought Tessa and Jem were looking for powerfulartificebut this kid? While I’m in love with William Herondale and the mere mention of him can bring me to my knees, this plot twist was uncalled for and stupid. Is CC trying to win people over? Someone please give me a valid reason why this kid is needed? And I know we don’t have Herondale representation, I know. Jace may be called Herondale but he was raised Lightwood. So if the only reason why this kid was brought was to be a plot device, then I’m out.Guys, I’m confused and mad and disappointed. I just don’t see a way out.What can let Emma and Julian be together? Well, one of them could become a supernatural creature. That way the parabatai bond would break and they could be together.Or they can be exiled and stripped from their Marks and if they survive that, then yeah, cool.Or they could die in the process.BUT if later in the books a way for them to be together is discovered while still being both Shadowhunters and alive, after everything we’ve been told, then what’s the fucking point?I’m not happy with this book, as you can see and I just don’t know what to make out of it.I'm not happy with how childish it was. One would think CC has grown as a writer(I just laughed so hard omg)so much in the past years that she's now capable of delivering mature content but no. High school drama going on here.I know I left a lot of things out in this review but it’d take me forever to tell you about every single thing I hated., error: \"Lex malla, lex nulla.A bad law is no law.\"This could be one of the hardest reviews I’ve ever written and that’s just because my feelings and thoughts are all over the place and I know, no matter how many days pass, I won’t be able to have a clear response so bear with me.This is going to be a mess.As usual, there were things I liked and things I didn’t.

            "Translation failed for: Five hundred years ago, a boy wore a crown—had every abundance in the world—but always asked for MORE.2 stars⭐️Ugh what a massive letdown. I was so close to DNFing this.The main issue with this is that there’s three POVs: Ravyn, Elspeth, and Elm’s.The problem is that one of the three doesn’t seem to make much sense in the book.Ravyn’s and Elspeth’s POV were definitely connected, but Elm’s POV?? It seemed like a whole new story LOL, disconnected from the search of the Twin Alders card and focusing on romance more than anything.Which, let’s talk about it.Ione and Elm? I HATED IT.It is not often that I HATE things in books; I tend to dislike, or be indifferent, more than hate. But this I HATED.It made ZERO sense.Oh, so Elm has been in love with her for years now?? Good! But SHOW me WHY he loves her!!!It felt painfully insta lovey!!!As a reader, I couldn’t take it seriously. Everything Elm said to Ione made me cringe SO BAD. It didn’t felt romantic to me, it just made me roll my eyes in annoyance and close my kindle to stop reading. There was one steamy scene but I skipped it altogether because I just couldn’t read it –the romance was so pathetic, Elm was pathetic, and Ione had so much potential(at least while she was under the Maiden card, she was the most interesting thing in Elm’s chapters, but after she was released from it she became just another regular, boring character).Okay but let’s continue with the POV situation: we have Ravyn’s POV, which is perhaps the most interesting out of the three (Elspeth, unfortunately, is pushed to the sidelines… which means the protagonist we spent a whole book reading about and reading FROM is barely present in the book). They’re in the woods, they’re fighting, they stumble upon something… STOP! It’s time for another Elm chapter!!! …. Are you serious?! We were JUST about to get action and revelations in Ravyn’s chapters… and the suddenly the author would decide that it was time for an Elm chapter. And so we went from action in the woods… to dances in the castle. It killed the flow SO MUCH!!!!!!!Related to this, I think my main issue with this book is that it is NOT a continuation of Elspeth and Ravyn’s story.Now the protagonists are Ione and Elm, and like I stated, I HATED their romance, and I DISLIKED Elm a lot. A lot a lot a lot. He’s whiny, cringey, and OH, don’t forget that he’s “rotten”. Because yeah, he describes himself as the “rotten prince” probably more times that the amount of Elspeth chapters in the book. IT WAS SO ANNOYING. LIKE WE GET IT, do you have any other personality trait than being “the misunderstood but charming and sarcastic Rowan”?!?!?!?!?So yes, 50% of the story is given to Ione and Elm. And you would think: okay, but if the author decides to give half of the story to this couple, SURELY it will be connected to the Elspeth-Ravyn-Nightmare side of the story, right? Whelp, no. Apparently Ione and Elm have their own card to recover: the Maiden card that Ione lost. So AAALL of Elm’s chapters (minus the last two, I think) were all about retrieving this card. Was it an interesting storyline, though? NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.The best things that happened in Elm’s chapters were: 1) discovering that real powers of the Maiden card, and 2) Hauth (the REAL gripping matter). Butthe search for the Maiden card was so boring, so unnecessarily long, and so disconnected from the other POVs. It was like Ione and Elm were living in their own world while Elspeth-Ravyn-Nightmare were out looking for the Twin Alders card. And if you’re going to give half the story to characters other than the two main characters (+the nightmare), you have to make sure your readers care about them even a tiny bit, so that their chapters will appeal to them. Elm’s chapters stirred nothing in me more than hatred LOL. I did not like him, did not like reading from his perspective (most of the time he was just being petty to his family and lusting, pathetically, after Ione), and was not one bit interested in the search of the Maiden card. Ione had more personality to her UNDER its influence lmao.And, hello?! Why did it take this book 30% to get going with the story? More than a quarter of this book was spent roaming the castle and deciding what to do with The Nightmare in the dungeon. There was no point to it!!! Just get going and get the Twin Alders card!!The pace was awful, specially that first quarter of the book. And the fact that we would have all this tension building up in Ravyn’s chapters… only to be followed up by Elm’s chapters and effectively breaking any sense of urgency… Ugh.It really made the pace and readability of the book suffer.As for the plot itself, everything with the Spirit got resolved so quickly? She just… gave Ravyn the card? That easily? No fight? Uhm. She’s all like “if you solve this riddle I’ll give you the card”, and it’s not a riddle at all but more like THE WHOLE FRICKING ANSWER LMAO. She basically just straight up TOLD Ravyn he’s a descendant of the Nighmare –which, let’s be honest… was anyone surprised? Since the first book the description for Bennet has been “gray eyes”. If the author really expected this to be a revelation, it failed miserably.Let’s continue with my complaints, with the unresolved plot points: Where was the father-daughter Elspeth-Erik moment? What happened to Elspeth’s stepmom and sisters? What of those characters in the forest that the author introduced once and we never saw again? What about JUST ONE conversation between Elspeth and Ione after everything they went through? More moments between Elspeth and Ravyn, hello???I’m only not giving this a lower rating because some of Ravyn’s chapters were truly engaging, especially those right in the middle, and I was truly hooked. ALSO, and this is perhaps the best part of the whole book:THE NIGHTMARE CARRIED SO HARD. He’s awesome. And I was also so endeared by his and Elspeth’s relationship… when he said that he wished to be a real father figure to Elspeth, my eyes got teary. That last chapter between them, saying goodbye, was the best part of the whole book. It must be so bittersweet for both of them to (finally) be rid of each other.In short: Deceptively good first chapter, everything after awfully boring. Main plot stalled to the max. Ravyn and Elspeth deserved more. Ione and Elm was unnecessary and dull. The Nightmare needed more book time., error: Five hundred years ago, a boy wore a crown—had every abundance in the world—but always asked for MORE.2 stars⭐️Ugh what a massive letdown. I was so close to DNFing this.The main issue with this is that there’s three POVs: Ravyn, Elspeth, and Elm’s.The problem is that one of the three doesn’t seem to make much sense in the book.Ravyn’s and Elspeth’s POV were definitely connected, but Elm’s POV?? It seemed like a whole new story LOL, disconnected from the search of the Twin Alders card and focusing on romance more than anything.Which, let’s talk about it.Ione and Elm? I HATED IT.It is not often that I HATE things in books; I tend to dislike, or be indifferent, more than hate. But this I HATED.It made ZERO sense.Oh, so Elm has been in love with her for years now?? Good! But SHOW me WHY he loves her!!!It felt painfully insta lovey!!!As a reader, I couldn’t take it seriously. Everything Elm said to Ione made me cringe SO BAD. It didn’t felt romantic to me, it just made me roll my eyes in annoyance and close my kindle to stop reading. There was one steamy scene but I skipped it altogether because I just couldn’t read it –the romance was so pathetic, Elm was pathetic, and Ione had so much potential(at least while she was under the Maiden card, she was the most interesting thing in Elm’s chapters, but after she was released from it she became just another regular, boring character).Okay but let’s continue with the POV situation: we have Ravyn’s POV, which is perhaps the most interesting out of the three (Elspeth, unfortunately, is pushed to the sidelines… which means the protagonist we spent a whole book reading about and reading FROM is barely present in the book). They’re in the woods, they’re fighting, they stumble upon something… STOP! It’s time for another Elm chapter!!! …. Are you serious?! We were JUST about to get action and revelations in Ravyn’s chapters… and the suddenly the author would decide that it was time for an Elm chapter. And so we went from action in the woods… to dances in the castle. It killed the flow SO MUCH!!!!!!!Related to this, I think my main issue with this book is that it is NOT a continuation of Elspeth and Ravyn’s story.Now the protagonists are Ione and Elm, and like I stated, I HATED their romance, and I DISLIKED Elm a lot. A lot a lot a lot. He’s whiny, cringey, and OH, don’t forget that he’s “rotten”. Because yeah, he describes himself as the “rotten prince” probably more times that the amount of Elspeth chapters in the book. IT WAS SO ANNOYING. LIKE WE GET IT, do you have any other personality trait than being “the misunderstood but charming and sarcastic Rowan”?!?!?!?!?So yes, 50% of the story is given to Ione and Elm. And you would think: okay, but if the author decides to give half of the story to this couple, SURELY it will be connected to the Elspeth-Ravyn-Nightmare side of the story, right? Whelp, no. Apparently Ione and Elm have their own card to recover: the Maiden card that Ione lost. So AAALL of Elm’s chapters (minus the last two, I think) were all about retrieving this card. Was it an interesting storyline, though? NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.The best things that happened in Elm’s chapters were: 1) discovering that real powers of the Maiden card, and 2) Hauth (the REAL gripping matter). Butthe search for the Maiden card was so boring, so unnecessarily long, and so disconnected from the other POVs. It was like Ione and Elm were living in their own world while Elspeth-Ravyn-Nightmare were out looking for the Twin Alders card. And if you’re going to give half the story to characters other than the two main characters (+the nightmare), you have to make sure your readers care about them even a tiny bit, so that their chapters will appeal to them. Elm’s chapters stirred nothing in me more than hatred LOL. I did not like him, did not like reading from his perspective (most of the time he was just being petty to his family and lusting, pathetically, after Ione), and was not one bit interested in the search of the Maiden card. Ione had more personality to her UNDER its influence lmao.And, hello?! Why did it take this book 30% to get going with the story? More than a quarter of this book was spent roaming the castle and deciding what to do with The Nightmare in the dungeon. There was no point to it!!! Just get going and get the Twin Alders card!!The pace was awful, specially that first quarter of the book. And the fact that we would have all this tension building up in Ravyn’s chapters… only to be followed up by Elm’s chapters and effectively breaking any sense of urgency… Ugh.It really made the pace and readability of the book suffer.As for the plot itself, everything with the Spirit got resolved so quickly? She just… gave Ravyn the card? That easily? No fight? Uhm. She’s all like “if you solve this riddle I’ll give you the card”, and it’s not a riddle at all but more like THE WHOLE FRICKING ANSWER LMAO. She basically just straight up TOLD Ravyn he’s a descendant of the Nighmare –which, let’s be honest… was anyone surprised? Since the first book the description for Bennet has been “gray eyes”. If the author really expected this to be a revelation, it failed miserably.Let’s continue with my complaints, with the unresolved plot points: Where was the father-daughter Elspeth-Erik moment? What happened to Elspeth’s stepmom and sisters? What of those characters in the forest that the author introduced once and we never saw again? What about JUST ONE conversation between Elspeth and Ione after everything they went through? More moments between Elspeth and Ravyn, hello???I’m only not giving this a lower rating because some of Ravyn’s chapters were truly engaging, especially those right in the middle, and I was truly hooked. ALSO, and this is perhaps the best part of the whole book:THE NIGHTMARE CARRIED SO HARD. He’s awesome. And I was also so endeared by his and Elspeth’s relationship… when he said that he wished to be a real father figure to Elspeth, my eyes got teary. That last chapter between them, saying goodbye, was the best part of the whole book. It must be so bittersweet for both of them to (finally) be rid of each other.In short: Deceptively good first chapter, everything after awfully boring. Main plot stalled to the max. Ravyn and Elspeth deserved more. Ione and Elm was unnecessary and dull. The Nightmare needed more book time. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: **WARNING:** RANTING AHEAD....This one is actually getting 1.5 stars NOT 2-- THAT'S how much I loath you Kelsey Hayes-- you can take your dumb \"love-plant\" andSHOVE IT.***********************************************What would you do if someone offered you an all-expenses-paid trip to India with a mysterious white tiger who also happens to be a handsome Indian prince? Eighteen-year old Kelsey Hayes is faced with just this offer after spending 2 weeks working as a hired hand at a local circus one summer-- and her life will never be the same.Soooo.... I had pretty much been *dying* to read this book for ages, and after reading review after raving review, I FINALLY picked it up off the shelves. I was so positively sure that I was going to absolutely love this book, that by the end, I would be in raptures and stumbling over myself trying to say enough good things about it.I don't know what the hell happened, but this book turned out to be an absolute joke.I KNOW, and Ihatesaying this, but I have to be honest. There were some things I liked aboutTiger's Curse, but they were all completely overshadowed bysome of the worst characterization I've ever encountered in a book.OK, here we go...So first, let me talk a little about Kelsey Hayes, the main character. At the beginning, I actually liked her. Laid-back, down-to-earth, and slightly quirky, she was a fun character to follow in the story.But then things started to go down hill--rapidly.I noticed about a hundred pages in that Kelsey's way of talking and thinking could be *extremely* juvenile at times-- juvenile and annoying. I don't know if anyone else thought the same thing, but as I made my way through this book, I just didn't feel like I was reading from an 18-year old's perspective. Some of the expressions she uses (my FAVE was when she exclaimed, \"You wily scoundrel!\" when Kishan tries to kiss her- DUDE. FIND ME SOMEONE WHO TALKS LIKE THIS), the way she addresses people (\"oh hey there Mister!\" -- seriously? Is your main character from The Little Rascals?), and just her whole way of thinking seemed more like that of an immature little kid than an adult...And things only went from bad to worse when Ren the Prince stepped into the picture. If Kelsey was slightly childish and annoying to begin with, it wasnothingcompared to the infantile monstrosity she turns into in the last half of the book. The immaturity levels reached astronomical proportions. How you ask? Here are a few examples:1.) She pouted and threw tiny tantrums when she was displeased about pretty muchanything-- and rather than be an ADULT and communicate with Ren about how conflicted she was feeling, she turned into a cold and standoffish little biotch. Then, when the poor guy asks her what's wrong, she says \"nothing\" (in that way where it's obviouslysomething) and goes right back to being Ice Queen Supreme. Clearly, this is anawesomeway to treat people.2.) She had the *exceedingly* annoying defense mechanism of needing to make sarcastic quipsevery 5 seconds, and the more defensive she got, the less likely it became for her to be serious or mature at crucial points in the story. I mean, the girl almostdiesand the first thing she does upon waking up is crack a few dumb jokes-- well I'm sorry, but I don't want to read about a main character who acts like she's constantly auditioning at a comedy club (and failing miserably, I might add)-- I want her to have a grown-up, serious side too! It was justtoo much. There is no way in hell this chick was 18-- maybe 12? Maybe.... even that's pushing it.3.) I just love how Kelsey was absolutely shocked and appalled when she sees Ren the Tiger-version and his brother hunt for food. Shedoesrealize that \"hunting\" involves killing something right?? And that tigers have a tendency towards being carnivores? And that tasty meat often comes from cute animals? I mean the girl had to actuallysing herself to sleepto get over it-- no, I'm not making this up, she sings herself to sleep (\"happy songs\" fromThe Wizard of Oz) because the tigers killed an antelope. Then she has nightmares about it.And she'seighteen-_-4.) Kelsey just LOVES to continually tell us about her little \"love-plant\" for Ren-- because you know, normal people talk like this. By the end I wanted to take some pesticide spray and a blow torch to Kelsey's freaking love-plant and incinerate the damn thing into the ground...(I won't even get into the fact that she wasdumb as a brickand could barely tie her own shoes without Ren holding her hand. But wait, you say! The book says she loves reading Shakespeare, well then she MUST be a total rocket scientist, no?? Give me a fa-reaking break Colleen- sorry my dear, but saying that your main protag reads Shakespeare does NOT make her smart and clever and oh-so-different from everyone else, because she comes across as acomplete dumbassin everything else she thinks, does, and says. Need I mention how she nearly gets herself killed near Kishindha? Because she goes to grab a pretty sparkly diamond out of the water, moments after she and Rennearly diedbecauseDUHthe prophesy TOLD you not to believe your eyes and that things weren't as they seemed! GAWD she's like freaking Abu the monkey in Aladdin, literallythatis who she reminded me of! **slaps forehead in total frustration**)But I think that out of all the things that bothered me about Kelsey, the VERY WORST was the fact that she made such a snap judgement about Ren--without even giving him the chance to prove that he was a good guy-- and then proceeded to treat him like total crap for the rest of the book, all for absolutely NO REASON other than her own stinking insecurity that \"she wasn't good enough for him.\" Kelsey Hayes, you were to put it bluntly, one of THE most immature characters I have ever read about, and you need to go find yourself a therapist.Pronto.So... Let's just say that by the end of this book, I had never wanted to punch a main character in the face quite so badly as Kelsey \"Boo-Hoo I'll Never Be Good Enough So I'll Just Act Like a Bitch 24/7\" Hayes.While we're sitting in on How to Make Your Characters As Unlikable as Possible 101, let's take a look at Ren. Overall, the guy wasn't too bad when you stand back and see him over the course of the book-- but I still couldn't stand him. And the thing is, he wouldn't have been such an unlikable character if the author hadn'tset him upto betotally unlikable. To prove my point, here are just a few of the phrases used to describe Ren's actions in this book:-Laughed \"acerbically\"-Smiled \"mockingly\" and \"malevolently\"-grinned \"maliciously\"-scoffed and smirked-was \"annoyingly happy\"Now you tell me-- wouldyoulike a character whose behavior is described this way?? The guy is annoying even when he's happy for crying out loud, and the rest of the time he's described as being a total ass-hat, and I'm supposed to be falling inlovewith him?!? I mean he sounds like a complete douche,amirite??There's only two explanations for this kind of character portrayal:1.) Renis, in fact, a douche-- in which case I can't stand him and hope he jumps off a cliff, or2.) Ren is actually a good guy and all of this is Kelsey's perception of him-- in which case Kelsey is *psycho cray cray* and I hopeshejumps off a cliff.In either case, I'm really not rooting for your characters.Then there's the fact that Ren is-- according to the story-- hundreds of years old. And it seems like in every YA story where one of the characters has been around for a long time (Twilight, Fallen...) we're just supposed to forget this fact and think it makes total sense for them to act like immature teenagers and have character dialogue that's somewhere along the lines of \"Ohemgee totally!!.\" I mean here we have this 300-year old Indian prince and he's referring to Kelsey as \"Kells??\"Are you freaking kidding me???So yes, this made Ren even MORE obnoxious as a main character, if that's even possible.(And oh, hey-- let's not even get into the glaring \"ick\" factor that this kind of plot point brings up:a 300-year old guy is flirting and trying to get with an 18-year old girl.Really. THINK ABOUT IT.)I also felt like the pacing of the plot was slightly off. Overall, I thought that the story itself was pretty good-- I loved the Indian setting and the adventurous element it had going on-- but there was just alotof superfluous description that got in the way for me. For example, when Kelsey gets on the plane to go to India, I thought we were never going to hear the end of all the luxurious details of the plane's interior and the food they ate. Don't get me wrong, I think that adding vivid description to your story is wonderful and sets the backdrop for all the action, but I also think there is a way to describe a scene while still leaving something up to the reader's imagination! I mean, do I *really* care what color hair ribbon Kelsey ties in her braids every day? And by the by, how many 18-year-olds do YOU know who tie hair ribbons in their braids? Or walk around with their blanket like they're freaking Linus from Charlie Brown??JUST SAYING.Besides plot pacing being off, many parts of the plot made ZERO SENSE. Tell me, how many foster parents do you know, who seem to be fairly sensible and, oh I don't know,**SANE**let their foster-daughter go off on a trip to INDIA with a strange older man and a tiger, after meeting said man ONE TIME?? This is basically how things played out:1.) Kelsey works 2 weeks as a hired hand at a circus (WHICH she got from some super-shady work placement company)2.) Kelsey reads Shakespeare to the tiger at said circus (Hmm yeah, that's totally normal) and then a strange Indian man shows up and tells Kelsey she is PERFECT for taking care of the tiger, if she can only GO TO INDIA to put tiger in a nature reserve (***RED FLAGS GOING OFF HERE***).3.) Kelsey's parents AGREE TO LET HER GO TO INDIA with strange older man after meeting him once, and within a WEEK Kelsey has all her documentation, passports, vaccines, etc. taken care of and is on a plane to India to take care of a rare white tiger species because 2 weeks of sweeping up crap at a circus has turned her into an animal GENIUS.**Insert dumb-founded expression HERE 0_o**Also-- and this is something I didn't even fully realize until awhile after I finished reading it-- but this book isBEYOND RACIST. It basically portrays Indian people as pathetic simpletons with horrible broken English (Ummm guess what Colleen? Many Indian people know how to speak English, and those who don't aren't idiots who you can write about as though they're incoherent monkeys...) Mr. Kadam, the Indian man employed by Prince Ren, basically spends the entire book kissing the ground Kelsey Hayes walks on, waxing eloquent about how amazing she is. WHY?? What the flying you-know-what is so awesome about Kelsey Hayes?? She's a vapid, lazy and stuck-up wish fulfillment device who is glorified by everyone for no good reason. Pretty mucheveryonein this book who is NOT WHITE AMERICAN is ignorantly and disrespectfully portrayed like a cartoon, exaggerated to the point of being comical-- except that it ISN'T FUNNY because it's straight-up RACISM. Then we have Kelsey- the White Girl Who Saves the Day- someone with absolutely no qualifications or connection to Indian culture, who we find out is actually the \"Chosen One\" of the Indian goddess Durga. YEAH YOU HEARD ME RIGHT. Kelsey, the most ignorant and brain-dead character ever conceived for YA fiction, the lazy American white girl who acts like a spoiled whiny little brat for 400+ freaking pages- is the savior of the Indian people. Excuse me while I very loudly exclaim:WTF?!?!?-------------------------------------------------------------As far as the romance goes, well if you're a fan of train wrecks, you're going to be in 7th heaven because this was just about as dysfunctional as they come. It was like watching two cars heading for a straight-on collision, and not being able to do a damn thing about it, so you just sit there with the same horrified expression on your face that you'd have if you accidentally swallowed a mouthful of spoiled milk.Three-month-old spoiled milk.I've already described Kelsey's emotional constipation and total lack of ability to do anything remotely mature, but I also didn't like how possessive Ren got of Kelsey as the story went on. Protective tiger-- awesome, Possessive love interest-- HELL to the NO. Not a fan. I was also pretty annoyed at the good ol' YA ploy of presenting the main character as Ms. I'm-Totally-Average-But-Every-Guy-Who-Sees-Me-Falls-Inexplicably-Yet-Madly-In-Love-With-Me-Tee-Hee!-- because it's been doneSOmany times. In fact, it's gotten to be about as cliche as being Disney-Princess-Perfect. Which brings me to...**************** My Brief Bookish Rant ****************Yeah so after all that, you're probably wondering what the heck else I have to rant about. (Do not underestimate my ranting skills *whahahaha!*) So here is my totally random gripe-- and trust me, this is random-- that I have to get off my shoulders. And I'm not trying to pick on this book specifically, it's more of a general trend that I see again and again in YA books-- and my slightly annoyed question is this:WHYdo authors always make aPOINTof telling us that their main female characters never or seldom wear makeup?I know, I know, this issucha dumb thing to rant about, but for *some reason* it bothers me. I mean, is there something bad about wearing makeup or doing your hair on a regular basis? Do they think that makeup makes their protagonist seem stupid or fake? Do they assume that readers won't relate to a character who wears makeup because... I don't know, people who read don't wear makeup? Likewhydoes it even need to be mentioned? It's like they expect me the reader to go, \"Ohh, she doesn't wear makeup! Well I can respect her alotmore now!\" And then on the other side of things, the \"mean girl\" or the bitchy back-stabber is often described as wearing makeup or being super tan or having the latest fashions.WHY??Is it a given that if a girl cares about her appearance she must be less of a person? If the main character is a frumpy Plain-Jane who's never worn heels and who thinks at best she's \"average,\" am I supposed to like her more?What exactlyare you trying to convey to me the reader when you tell me that your main character doesn't wear makeup? I just don't see what the heck this has to do with the characterization of someone, and personally I couldn't care less whether the main character wears makeup or not, sostopbringing it up like it's a determining factor in whether or not I'll relate to/like/respect that character more!(I will mention that Kelsey does get dolled up a few times in the book, but what irked me was her complete inability to see herself as being attractive, no matter what. This isnota good character trait. Insecurity and false modesty are NOT attractive in anyone-- it's extremely immature and I CAN'T STAND characters that constantly use self-pity and self-deprecation to excuse themselves from acting grown-up.SO STOP IT RIGHT NOW!!)OK, rant over. I feel much better now!~Final Thoughts~Tiger's Curseis one of those books that I think appeals to a large group of people because it has a lot of great things going on-- romance, adventure, travel, mystery, an ancient curse-- I mean, what's not to love about that? BUT-- and this is a big but-- none of them, in my opinion, were executed well. The romance devolved into two spoiled teenagers acting like juvenile brats, the adventure and mystery were bogged down by way too much description, and honestly, by the end I was so fed up with the main characters that I really couldn't care less about where the story was going-- I just wanted it to end so I didn't have to constantly fight the temptation to throw the book out the window of a 50-story building.So my final word with this one is- proceed with caution. While I can see the appeal for many readers, if you are like me and can't stand pointless drama, immature dialogue, and characters who act much younger than their years, you might want to think twice before picking this one up. On the other hand, the ratings overall forTiger's Curseare extremely good, so this may very well be a case of me just personally not liking it.  Read what other people had to say about this book, you might end up loving it-- I, unfortunately, was not one of those people.~Lea @LC's Adventures in Libraryland, error: **WARNING:** RANTING AHEAD....This one is actually getting 1.5 stars NOT 2-- THAT'S how much I loath you Kelsey Hayes-- you can take your dumb \"love-plant\" andSHOVE IT.***********************************************What would you do if someone offered you an all-expenses-paid trip to India with a mysterious white tiger who also happens to be a handsome Indian prince?

Kelsey's parents AGREE TO LET HER GO TO INDIA with strange older man after meeting him once, and within a WEEK Kelsey has all her documentation, passports, vaccines, etc. taken care of and is on a plane to India to take care of a rare white tiger species because 2 weeks of sweeping up crap at a circus has turned her into an animal GENIUS.**Insert dumb-founded expression HERE 0_o**Also-- and this is something I didn't even fully realize until awhile after I finished reading it-- but this book isBEYOND RACIST. It basically portrays Indian people as pathetic simpletons with horrible broken English (Ummm guess what Colleen? Many Indian people know how to speak English, and those who don't aren't idiots who you can write about as though they're incoherent monkeys...) Mr. Kadam, the Indian man employed by Prince Ren, basically spends the entire book kissing the ground Kelsey Hayes walks on, waxing eloquent about how amazing she is. WHY?? What the flying you-know-what is so awesome about Kelsey Hayes?? She's a vapid, lazy and stuck-up wish fulfillment device who is glorified by everyone for no good reason. Pretty mucheveryonein this book who is NOT WHITE AMERICAN is ignorantly and disrespectfully portrayed like a cartoon, exaggerated to the point of being comical-- except that it ISN'T FUNNY because it's straight-up RACISM. Then we have Kelsey- the White Girl Who Saves the Day- someone with absolutely no qualifications or connection to Indian culture, who we find out is actually the \"Chosen One\" of the Indian goddess Durga. YEAH YOU HEARD ME RIGHT. Kelsey, the most ignorant and brain-dead character ever conceived for YA fiction, the lazy American white girl who acts like a spoiled whiny little brat for 400+ freaking pages- is the savior of the Indian people. Excuse me while I very loudly exclaim:WTF?!?!?-------------------------------------------------------------As far as the romance goes, well if you're a fan of train wrecks, you're going to be in 7th heaven because this was just about as dysfunctional as they come. It was like watching two cars heading for a straight-on collision, and not being able to do a damn thing about it, so you just sit there with the same horrified expression on your face that you'd have if you accidentally swallowed a mouthful of spoiled milk.Three-month-old spoiled milk.I've already described Kelsey's emotional constipation and total lack of ability to do anything remotely mature, but I also didn't like how possessive Ren got of Kelsey as the story went on. Protective tiger-- awesome, Possessive love interest-- HELL to the NO. Not a fan. I was also pretty annoyed at the good ol' YA ploy of presenting the main character as Ms. I'm-Totally-Average-But-Every-Guy-Who-Sees-Me-Falls-Inexplicably-Yet-Madly-In-Love-With-Me-Tee-Hee!-- because it's been doneSOmany times. In fact, it's gotten to be about as cliche as being Disney-Princess-Perfect. Which brings me to...**************** My Brief Bookish Rant ****************Yeah so after all that, you're probably wondering what the heck else I have to rant about. (Do not underestimate my ranting skills *whahahaha!*) So here is my totally random gripe-- and trust me, this is random-- that I have to get off my shoulders. And I'm not trying to pick on this book specifically, it's more of a general trend that I see again and again in YA books-- and my slightly annoyed question is this:WHYdo authors always make aPOINTof telling us that their main female characters never or seldom wear makeup?I know, I know, this issucha dumb thing to rant about, but for *some reason* it bothers me. I mean, is there something bad about wearing makeup or doing your hair on a regular basis? Do they think that makeup makes their protagonist seem stupid or fake? Do they assume that readers won't relate to a character who wears makeup because... I don't know, people who read don't wear makeup? Likewhydoes it even need to be mentioned? It's like they expect me the reader to go, \"Ohh, she doesn't wear makeup! Well I can respect her alotmore now!\" And then on the other side of things, the \"mean girl\" or the bitchy back-stabber is often described as wearing makeup or being super tan or having the latest fashions.WHY??Is it a given that if a girl cares about her appearance she must be less of a person? If the main character is a frumpy Plain-Jane who's never worn heels and who thinks at best she's \"average,\" am I supposed to like her more?What exactlyare you trying to convey to me the reader when you tell me that your main character doesn't wear makeup? I just don't see what the heck this has to do with the characterization of someone, and personally I couldn't care less whether the main character wears makeup or not, sostopbringing it up like it's a determining factor in whether or not I'll relate to/like/respect that character more!(I will mention that Kelsey does get dolled up a few times in the book, but what irked me was her complete inability to see herself as being attractive, no matter what. This isnota good character trait. Insecurity and false modesty are NOT attractive in anyone-- it's extremely immature and I CAN'T STAND characters that constantly use self-pity and self-deprecation to excuse themselves from acting grown-up.SO STOP IT RIGHT NOW!!)OK, rant over. I feel much better now!~Final Thoughts~Tiger's Curseis one of those books that I think appeals to a large group of people because it has a lot of great things going on-- romance, adventure, travel, mystery, an ancient curse-- I mean, what's not to love about that? BUT-- and this is a big but-- none of them, in my opinion, were executed well. The romance devolved into two spoiled teenagers acting like juvenile brats, the adventure and mystery were bogged down by way too much description, and honestly, by the end I was so fed up with the main characters that I really couldn't care less about where the story was going-- I just wanted it to end so I didn't have to constantly fight the temptation to throw the book out the window of a 50-story building.So my final word with this one is- proceed with caution. While I can see the appeal for many readers, if you are like me and can't stand pointless drama, immature dialogue, and characters who act much younger than their years, you might want to think twice before picking this one up. On the other hand, the ratings overall forTiger's Curseare extremely good, so this may very well be a case of me just personally not liking it.  Read what other people had to say about this book, you might end up loving it-- I, unfortunately, was not one of those people.~Lea @LC's Adventures in Libraryland --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

But it was the idea alone that kept me going.The other half fell so flat it's flatter than a sheet of printer paper.First of all, the pacing, especially in the beginning, just did nothing for me. It was fast, but not in a good way. It was fast in a way that seemedrushedwith little good development.I also wasn't feeling the writing style. It was very cut-and-dry and a little too straightforward for my taste.And I like neither Kelsey nor Ren. I don't hate them by any stretch of the word, but I can't bring myself to root for them.Kelsey is so immature and such a simpleton that half the time, I was thoroughly annoyed by being in her head.Allow me to present you with an example:When she first arrived in Mumbai, India on page 69:\"The men began talking very fast to one another in Hindi.\"Simple quote, right? Why would I have issues with it? Allow me to explain;Hindi is not the most spoken language in Mumbai; that honor goes to Marathi. Aside from that fact, there are at least 6 or 7 different languages spoken in Mumbai. From what we've seen, Kelsey has zero knowledge of the Indian culture, so how onearthwas she able to recognize the Hindi language? How on earth did she know that the men were speaking in Hindi of all the options?? There is no way she could have or would have known this based on prior knowledge. Unless she just guessed because \"Hindi\" sounds like \"Indian\". That's almost like saying that all Asians are Chinese by default!! Culturally ignorant much!?!Now in general, this wouldn't be the hugest deal, but why would someone like Kelsey,who knows diddly squat about India, be the key to breaking an ancient Indian curse? Part of me doubts she had evenheardof India before her stupid quest.There is nothing great or special about her, not even remotely. She displays no unique qualities, NOTHING to make me root for her.She is also one of those characters that look down on her physical appearance, especially in the presence of a handsome man.She's constantly likeoh I have no unique appearanceandwho me?? Oh you must be mistaken!whenever someone pays her a compliment. If she is wearing a beautiful dress, she credits the goddamned dress. In fact, she's convinced she can't be with Ren because he'll quickly lose interest in her because she's not supermodel gorgeous!Like, you poor baby! Here's a troll playing you a violin:Page 92:\"Who was I to reject a handsome man...\"What. The. Actual.

I grinned to myself. If that was true, then Ren's signature was the John Hancock of kisses.\"Like, dude that was your first kiss. How could you possibly compare his kissing skills to any other?Then when Kelsey realized that she was falling for Ren (why, I don't know) she decided to put distance between them---in the most immature and bitchy way possible---because she didn't see any way for them to have a future together after having broken the curse.Is there a legitimate reason for Kelsey to act like such a bitch to Ren??I mean, I don't like Ren that much; I find him waaaaay too fake to be attractive. But he genuinely has feelings for Kelsey, even though it's pure insta-love. The \"romance\" gave me no warm fuzzy feelings.At one point, Mr. Kadam sends Kelsey a dress to wear to dine with Ren (an event she did not know about at the time). Kelsey immediately put on the dress for no reason. She wasn't confused or thrown off that she received a gorgeous dress and pair of heels from an old-ass man, albeit a good friend. She didn't go ask him what it was all about and she didn't even question how the fuck he justknewher size. She just puts it on then says,\"A dress like this required makeup, so I headed to the bathroom and finished getting ready.\"(358)Bitch, for WHAT exactly??

so i am mostly going to just bitch about why this book misrepresentswuthering heightsand why that makes me cranky.i suppose it is ambitious of her to have attempted to pepper her vampire romance novels with elements of better works of literature like, say, shakespeare and jane austen. she made the decision to try to shoehorn these characters into the mold of another book, and just didn't bother trying to fix the parts that overflowed or got stuck together.but you can't get mad at a puppy for pissing on the rug.and i knew what i was getting into.before i started reading this, i was aware that this was thewuthering heightsinstallment of the series, so i was obligated to read it on those grounds alone, as i will read any retelling of w.h., for better or for worse. usually worse.and elizabeth had warned me and warned me that meyer got w.h. all wrong and had reversed the roles of heathcliff and linton in a most embarrassing way, but at first, i saw no problems. bella was obviously catherine, edward was heathcliff the true love and jacob was linton,the more \"appropriate\" choice, right? done and done. i kept reading, shocked, thinking, \"but elizabeth is never wrong! what gives??\"is she only basing this on appearance? on the superficial? edward is fair and wealthy and very understanding of bella's other ties - like linton (maybe not \"understanding\" in linton's case, but \"ineffectual\") and jacob is definitely darker-complected, like heathcliff, and tied to nature and the earth. but that shouldn't change the basic differences.because obviously edward is the sun to bella's flower face. she cannot be without him - even an afternoon spent apart is unendurable and the intensity of their love is undeniable and unbreakable and blah and blah. jacob is her father's choice for her, which makes him linton, who is technically a better choice because there is less self-destructive passion, and choosing him allows her to remain, you know,alive.but let's back up.becausewuthering heightswas never a choice between two suitable men. it was a choice between passion and security. head and heart. and linton was never analternativeto heathcliff, catherine always just wanted it all. it was never about love, not with linton.he was simply the path of least resistance, and a means to an end. securing him meant securing a place for heathcliff, whom she could never marry. but who needs marriage when your husband is much weaker than your lover?so, in a more modern version of the story,it makes sense to do away with the financial angle, especially with characters this young. the conflict here is between soul and body. all bella has to do is choose humanity or immortality.easy-peasy. so the reversal of edward and jacob's fortunes didn't cause me too much grief, and still maintains the distinction between edward/heathcliff and jacob/linton. the root of the conflict is the same: to go with an all-consuming passion that \"eclipses\" one's own self and is potentially dangerous (for so so many reasons here) or to go with the one who feels more like \"family,\" who has the paternal approval, who will allow her to remain a living breathing human and retain her entire life...except her passion.fine. this still parallels w.h.and the more specific details: heathcliff goes away while catherine recovers at the linton's. and then he goes on that much longer absence, plunging her into despair. so far, so good. edward leaves bella innew moonand jacob steps in to be there for her and heals her and manages to stick a little bit of him in the space edward's leaving left.but then it gets messy and too many of heathcliff's characteristics start leaking into jacob. because jacob is kind of a dick. forcing kisses, always smirking and pushing his boundaries.he takes much more delight in troublemaking and hurting his rival, and occasionally hurts bella,too. jacob is warm and furious and tied to the forest the way heathcliff is tied to the moors.it is jacob who is the earthbound heathcliff she can remain a grubby child with. meyer rightly recognizes edward as the other half of bella's soul, but extracts all the physical, earthly passion from that role and gives it to jacob.edward protects her like a fine crystal object while his sister dresses her like a doll. what does this sound like?? linton linton linton!bella as catherine is obviously the weakest here. she is nothing like catherine. she moans about not being good enough for edward. catherine was never \"good\" enough for linton, but did that stop her? she barreled in and took what she wanted and refused to leave. bella fusses over everyone and just wants everyone to be happy and self-sacrifices all over the place. i understand that bella's character has already been established in other books, but how can she compare herself to catherine with a straight face?? catherine is a goddamn honey badger. bella is a mother hen.her relationship with edward certainly has elements that are unappealing - who wants to be watched and protected that closely all the time?, but at least i believed in their feelings because they are always reminding me and shoving my face in it.jacob forces himself on her, laughs at her human weakness when she fights back, and tries to separate her from her happiness at every turn. it is both arrogant and insecure, but this is still somehow, but the one who is most \"like family\" who bella's dad wants her to be with. (do NOT get me started on \"parental roles in the twilight saga.\")(but quickly: our girl walks through the door from her vacation and already is making dinner for her father who supports some shirtless douchebag's forced kisses, but hates the rich boy who really wants to marry his daughter and preserve her virginity.) but this is another reversal to w.h., too since heathcliff was at leastraisedas family, even if you don't interpret heathcliff as mr. earnshaw's bastad son. which is not a belief i personally subscribe to, but it is out there.edward is patient and forgiving and gentle and willing to give bella the space she needs before making her decision before she is even aware there is a decision to make.come on - that can't be right!heathcliff doesn't share. he can tolerate linton because he is weak and catherine would not have him harmed, but this vampire zen shit has no place in a heathcliff character, and isn't even a linton quality. that element is pure meyer.inwuthering heights, everyone behaves poorly.in this one, it is really just jacob as linton, i mean heathcliff, i mean jacob.nonsense.apart from any messing-with-the-heights stumbles, this also maintains all the lazy writing and comical details meyer interprets as passion: all the tooth grinding and clenching and chuckling and things said under the breath.oh, and snorting. why does everyone snort? and borrowing lines fromwuthering heightsto help bolster your characters is like posing next to the chubby girl in photographs to look slimmer. we see your borrowed finery.and the love triangle thing is pretty forced. bella herself doesn't even realize until the end that she is even in a love triangle, so how are we supposed to? honestly, i am aware that there is such a thing as \"team jacob\" because i am a citizen of the world, but god - what's the appeal in some pushy dude who won't take \"no\" for an answer??and why do i excuse heathcliff all his sins? is it because the writing is better? is it because i believe in his love in a way i do not believe in bella? because when i think of heathcliff i feel a physical reaction in my heart. when i think of jacob, i roll my eyes.i actually likedtwilight, despite its flaws.new moonwas boring and repetitive. this one was irritating because of how much i looove w.h.there is no evil in this book - no revenge. the stakes are too low in the triangle.i picture the three of them at a bar:oh, i made sure jacob would overhear my conversation with bella about our upcoming nuptials. snort chuckle. eeeevil! oh, i knew edward could read my mind so i thought about how sad bella was when he went away. clenched teeth, snort,eeeevil! oh, i married her husband's sister, alternately beating and ignoring her, raised my enemy's son to be an illiterate brute, and ruined everyone's lives while i mourned my one true love. (crickets... the sound of edward and jacob pissing themselves)here is some exciting eclipse information for this year:http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse....and get on that venus one, because you're not gonna get another chance unless you are team edward.and because this still makes me laugh:http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/f03d...i think i have probably made a point or two in that rant somewhere. i wasn't enraged, overall, not really, but it was a pretty bloated book and i really don't get all the love for this series...oh, and a gross dedication:to my husband pancho for your patience, love, friendship, humor, and willingness to eat out.TMI, stephenie meyer, TMI ...come to my blog!, error: snif. my link is worthless now.this is the virgin daiquiri version ofwuthering heights, all watered down, plopped in a blender, and sitting at the folding card table with the kiddies.and they are all gulping it down without knowing that the real deal is way more fun.elizabeth has probably written the best review this book could ever get, with much wittier analogies, so go read that, then come back here for some less-articulate complaints.i messed up. i thought i would have a nice vacation, where i would have plenty of time and concentration to lounge overour mutual friend. instead, there was drinking, and some self-pity, and vacation-langour, and i just couldn't give dickens the attention he deserves. you know who really doesn't deserve my complete attention?

(do NOT get me started on \"parental roles in the twilight saga.\")(but quickly: our girl walks through the door from her vacation and already is making dinner for her father who supports some shirtless douchebag's forced kisses, but hates the rich boy who really wants to marry his daughter and preserve her virginity.) but this is another reversal to w.h., too since heathcliff was at leastraisedas family, even if you don't interpret heathcliff as mr. earnshaw's bastad son. which is not a belief i personally subscribe to, but it is out there.edward is patient and forgiving and gentle and willing to give bella the space she needs before making her decision before she is even aware there is a decision to make.come on - that can't be right!heathcliff doesn't share. he can tolerate linton because he is weak and catherine would not have him harmed, but this vampire zen shit has no place in a heathcliff character, and isn't even a linton quality. that element is pure meyer.inwuthering heights, everyone behaves poorly.in this one, it is really just jacob as linton, i mean heathcliff, i mean jacob.nonsense.apart from any messing-with-the-heights stumbles, this also maintains all the lazy writing and comical details meyer interprets as passion: all the tooth grinding and clenching and chuckling and things said under the breath.oh, and snorting. why does everyone snort? and borrowing lines fromwuthering heightsto help bolster your characters is like posing next to the chubby girl in photographs to look slimmer. we see your borrowed finery.and the love triangle thing is pretty forced. bella herself doesn't even realize until the end that she is even in a love triangle, so how are we supposed to? honestly, i am aware that there is such a thing as \"team jacob\" because i am a citizen of the world, but god - what's the appeal in some pushy dude who won't take \"no\" for an answer??and why do i excuse heathcliff all his sins? is it because the writing is better? is it because i believe in his love in a way i do not believe in bella? because when i think of heathcliff i feel a physical reaction in my heart. when i think of jacob, i roll my eyes.i actually likedtwilight, despite its flaws.new moonwas boring and repetitive. this one was irritating because of how much i looove w.h.there is no evil in this book - no revenge. the stakes are too low in the triangle.i picture the three of them at a bar:oh, i made sure jacob would overhear my conversation with bella about our upcoming nuptials. snort chuckle. eeeevil! oh, i knew edward could read my mind so i thought about how sad bella was when he went away. clenched teeth, snort,eeeevil! oh, i married her husband's sister, alternately beating and ignoring her, raised my enemy's son to be an illiterate brute, and ruined everyone's lives while i mourned my one true love. (crickets... the sound of edward and jacob pissing themselves)here is some exciting eclipse information for this year:http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse....and get on that venus one, because you're not gonna get another chance unless you are team edward.and because this still makes me laugh:http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/f03d...i think i have probably made a point or two in that rant somewhere. i wasn't enraged, overall, not really, but it was a pretty bloated book and i really don't get all the love for this series...oh, and a gross dedication:to my husband pancho for your patience, love, friendship, humor, and willingness to eat out.TMI, stephenie meyer, TMI ...come to my blog! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

            "Translation failed for: SPOILER ALERT: Details of the novel are revealed in this review.First of all, I saw the film before I read the book. With many works, that would prejudice my reaction somewhat, but I believe that this book and movie are so much alike that I can offer an unfiltered opinion.This is the story of a family that has been fractured by a monumental accident. Grace Maclean is a twelve year old girl, the daughter of very wealthy New Yorkers. Her father, Robert, is a lawyer and her mother Annie is a magazine editor, an Englishwoman. Grace's embrace of life is fulsome and the reader is drawn to her immediately. Robert Maclean is also an extremely sympathetic character. Annie, however is a driven woman. After taking over at the magazine, she has instituted a \"bloodletting\" by firing old staffers and has alienated not only those she works with, but her husband and daughter as well.The first unfortunate decision Nicholas Evans made was to feature the most despicable character in the book and set her up as the centerpiece of the action.But the book still begins with tremendous promise. The writing is excellent, the descriptions so precise as to engender the feeling that one is living in the moments and places he creates. Grace is riding her horse, Pilgrim, with her friend Judith at the country estate that the Macleans own. Her father has come down from New York with her, while Annie works away in the Big Apple. On an icy road, the horses panic as a tractor-trailer advances on them, skidding on the ice. Grace is thrown off as her horse Pilgrim turns to face the oncoming semi and literally leaps at it trying to protect his rider.Judith and her horse are both killed, Pilgrim is severely wounded, and Grace's leg is mangled so badly that it must be amputated. There is severe psychological trauma for both Grace and Pilgrim. The horse is crazed and completely uncontrollable. While Robert reacts in much the way one would expect a parent to, Annie controls her emotions completely, but becomes obsessed with finding a cure for Pilgrim.That cure comes in the form of Tom Booker, a cowboy and rancher in Montana who is a \"horse whisperer\". He has the ability to calm and cure horses with psychological problems. At first, he refuses to work with Pilgrim. Annie's persistence, which includes driving her daughter and the horse to Montana, finally pays off once Tom meets Grace and sees that the problem runs deeper than just an injured horse. He takes on Pilgrim as a project and Annie and Grace move to the spare house at the ranch so that Grace can work with Tom as he slowly brings both horse and girl back to life.At this point, the story has been told so expertly that a reader cannot disengage no matter what. The story has been wonderfully drawn as the tale of a family that has fallen apart, a girl and horse painfully and perhaps permanently wounded and the calm man who can supply the solutions to cure them both.Unfortunately, it is also at the point that Evans strays from his story and inserts a romance that has no business being in this book. By having Annie fall for Tom, the reader comes to vilify her and see her as a selfish, arrogant bitch. Further, the character of Tom, initially so strong and admirable, becomes a parody -- the cowboy who can't help falling in love with city women. How on earth could this calm and centered human being fall in love with one of the most unlikable characters ever written? It is a complete mystery that has no answer, except that it adds a level of melodrama that brings the book to a complete halt. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if it had merely been a flirtation that Tom turned his back on (in order to work on the horse, which is what the story is really about), but Evans does not stop when given the chance. He creates a little vacation for Tom's ranch family -- to Disneyland of all places -- so that Tom can spend a week having sex with Annie.At this point, the story has become so thoroughly disgusting that all of the promise has permanently departed. After the week of sex, Grace finds out, of course, and takes Pilgrim out on some kind of crazy ride. It says a great deal that the reader finds their own disgust reflected in Grace. In rescuing Grace, Tom allows himself to get killed. Now, what's going on with that is also a complete mystery.Lost in this tawdry little subplot is the final cure of Pilgrim, which should have been built correctly so that it provided the denouement of the story that Evans so carefully set up during most of the book. It becomes almost a little side show as Tom and Annie wallow in lust and self-pity.I guess the bottom line is that every author should have an editor with a steady hand who can say, \"Stop -- you're going in the wrong direction.\" But with the state of publishing any more, it may even have been an editor who said, \"You need some romance in this book.\"It's a great pity to see a story with so much promise flushed down the drain., error: UWAGA SPOILER: Szczegóły powieści zostały ujawnione w tej recenzji. Przede wszystkim obejrzałem film, zanim przeczytałem książkę. W przypadku wielu dzieł mogłoby to nieco wpłynąć na moją reakcję, ale uważam, że ta książka i film są tak podobne, że mogę przedstawić niesfiltrowaną opinię. To historia rodziny, która została rozbita przez monumentalny wypadek. Grace Maclean jest dwunastoletnią dziewczynką, córką bardzo bogatych Nowojorczyków. Jej ojciec, Robert, jest prawnikiem, a matka Annie jest redaktorką magazynu, Angielką. Grace przyjmuje życie z entuzjazmem i czytelnik od razu się do niej przyciąga. Robert Maclean jest również niezwykle sympatyczną postacią. Annie jest jednak zdeterminowaną kobietą. Po przejęciu magazynu, wprowadziła „rozlew krwi”, zwalniając starych pracowników i zrażając nie tylko tych, z którymi pracuje, ale także swojego męża i córkę. Pierwszą niefortunną decyzją Nicholasa Evansa było pokazanie najbardziej odrażającej postaci w książce i uczynienie jej centralną postacią akcji. Ale książka i tak zaczyna się z ogromną obietnicą. Styl pisania jest doskonały, opisy tak precyzyjne, że wywołują uczucie, że żyje się w chwilach i miejscach, które się tworzy. Grace jedzie na swoim koniu, Pilgrimie, ze swoją przyjaciółką Judith w wiejskiej posiadłości, którą posiadają Macleansowie. Jej ojciec przyjechał z Nowego Jorku, a Annie pracuje w Wielkim Jabłku. Na oblodzonej drodze konie wpadają w panikę, gdy zbliża się do nich ciągnik siodłowy, ślizgając się po lodzie. Grace zostaje zrzucona, gdy jej koń Pilgrim odwraca się, by stanąć twarzą do nadjeżdżającej ciężarówki i dosłownie skacze na nią, próbując chronić swojego jeźdźca. Judith i jej koń giną, Pilgrim jest ciężko ranny, a noga Grace jest tak poważnie zmiażdżona, że ​​musi zostać amputowana. Zarówno Grace, jak i Pilgrim doznają poważnego urazu psychicznego. Koń jest szalony i zupełnie niekontrolowalny. Podczas gdy Robert reaguje w sposób, w jaki można by się spodziewać po rodzicach, Annie całkowicie kontroluje swoje emocje, ale staje się obsesyjnie zajęta znalezieniem lekarstwa dla Pilgrima. To lekarstwo przychodzi w postaci Toma Bookera, kowboja i farmera z Montany, który jest „zaklinaczem koni”. Ma on zdolność uspokajania i leczenia koni z problemami psychologicznymi. Początkowo odmawia współpracy z Pilgrimem. Wytrwałość Annie, która obejmuje zawiezienie córki i konia do Montany, w końcu się opłaca, gdy Tom spotyka Grace i widzi, że problem jest głębszy niż tylko ranny koń. Podejmuje się Pilgrima jako projektu, a Annie i Grace przeprowadzają się do wolnego domu na ranczu, aby Grace mogła pracować z Tomem, który powoli przywraca do życia konia i dziewczynę. W tym momencie historia została opowiedziana tak fachowo, że czytelnik nie może się oderwać, bez względu na wszystko. Historia została wspaniale narysowana jako opowieść o rodzinie, która się rozpadła, dziewczynie i koniu boleśnie i być może trwale zranionych oraz spokojnym mężczyźnie, który może dostarczyć rozwiązań, aby ich oboje wyleczyć. Niestety, w tym momencie Evans odchodzi od swojej historii i wplata romans, który nie powinien znaleźć się w tej książce. Sprawiając, że Annie zakochuje się w Tomie, czytelnik zaczyna ją oczerniać i postrzegać jako samolubną, arogancką sukę. Ponadto postać Toma, początkowo tak silna i godna podziwu, staje się parodią - kowboj, który nie może powstrzymać się od zakochania w kobietach z miasta. Jak na Boga ta spokojna i zrównoważona istota ludzka mogła zakochać się w jednej z najbardziej nielubianych postaci, jakie kiedykolwiek napisano? To kompletna zagadka, na którą nie ma odpowiedzi, poza tym, że dodaje poziom melodramatu, który całkowicie zatrzymuje książkę. Może nie byłoby tak źle, gdyby Tom odwrócił się tylko od flirtu (aby popracować nad koniem, o czym tak naprawdę jest ta historia), ale Evans nie zatrzymuje się, gdy ma szansę. Tworzy małe wakacje dla rodziny Toma z rancza — do Disneylandu, ze wszystkich miejsc — aby Tom mógł spędzić tydzień uprawiając seks z Annie. W tym momencie historia staje się tak obrzydliwa, że ​​cała obietnica na stałe zniknęła. Po tygodniu seksu Grace oczywiście się dowiaduje i zabiera Pilgrima na jakąś szaloną przejażdżkę. Wiele mówi fakt, że czytelnik znajduje swoje własne obrzydzenie odzwierciedlone w Grace. Ratując Grace, Tom pozwala się zabić. Teraz, co się z tym dzieje, jest również całkowitą zagadką. W tej tandetnej, małej fabule pobocznej zagubione jest ostateczne lekarstwo na Pielgrzyma, które powinno zostać zbudowane poprawnie, aby zapewnić rozwiązanie historii, którą Evans tak starannie przygotował przez większość książki. Staje się to niemal małym pokazem pobocznym, gdy Tom i Annie taplają się w pożądaniu i litowaniu nad sobą. Myślę, że sednem sprawy jest to, że każdy autor powinien mieć redaktora z pewną ręką, który potrafi powiedzieć: „Stój – zmierzasz w złym kierunku”. Ale biorąc pod uwagę stan publikacji, być może był to nawet redaktor, który powiedział: „Potrzebujesz trochę romansu w tej książce”. To wielka szkoda, że ​​historia z tak wieloma obietnicami zostaje spuszczona w błoto. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: Rating: 2.5 StarsI just want to let you all know that while I'm writing this, I am also building a fort. Yes, a fort to protect me from all the boulders and bombs that will most likely be thrown my way forhighlydisliking this novel. It doesn't matter that my fort is made of pillows or that it contains highly flammable books inside it - the point is, I have a fort. Thus, I hope you won't attack me since...well...I have a fort!Part 1: In Which I \"Get It\"I get it. I seriously do. Igetwhy there is so much hype surrounding this novel. Igetwhy you all love it. I really do.Unearthlyreleased during a time when angel novels such asHush, Hush, Hades,andFallenwere making waves - not all good - in the book community. Thus, in comparison with those novels,Unearthlyis truly a masterpiece. But, in my opinion, it's a masterpiece in the same way thatTwilightis a masterpiece when compared toFifty Shades of GreyorBeautiful Disaster.It's much better than the norm, but it isn'tthatgood at the same time.More about that later - back to why I \"get it.\" First and foremost,Unearthlyprovides a new and unique take on angel lore. Not only is it a story thatdoesn'tfeature a teenage girl falling in love with a fallen angel, it is also a story thatdoesn'tfeature insta-love or atruelove triangle. Yippee! Clara, the protagonist of our story, is one-fourth of an angel herself. In Hand's novel, angels are given a divine purpose in life that they must fulfill. As they grow into teenagers, they begin to get glimpses or visions of their purpose and must accordingly go about completing them. Thus, when Clara is given a vision of saving a handsome teenage boy from a fire, she and her family take off from California to Wyoming where she meets Christian, the boy of her dreams (literally!).Now, let me discuss the reasons why this novel really is quite good. First and foremost, I loved Clara's relationship with her mother, who is a half-angel. While I found it to be a little too perfect at some points, it was still nice to see her mother be such an active part of her life. Furthermore, I found that Clara's apprehensions about moving, her difficulty fitting into the social scheme at her new school, and her confusion over whether or not she is meant to get closer to Christian all handled quite realistically. In addition to Christian though, we have Tucker Avery - the annoying twin brother of Clara's best friend, Wendy. Tucker and Clara's relationship took a forefront in the second-half of the novel and I enjoyed how it was never rushed and it grew through conversation and the two spending time with each other.So, really, there's a lot to love about this book: (1) Original/Unique/New take on angel lore (2) No Missing Parent Syndrome (3) Quite realistic emotions (4) One heart-warming romance that grows through conversation. So, you might ask, what went wrong?Part 2: In Which I Don't Fall for the HypeYou see, despite having some excellent and interesting points,Unearthlywas actually a massive disappointment. I believe that this is primarily due to the order in which I read my angel books --> (1) Hush, Hush (2) Daughter of Smoke and Bone (3) Angelfall (4) Shadows (5) Unearthly <-- Do you see a problem here? No? Well, let me tell you. I read this novelafterreadingAngelfallandDaughter of Smoke and Bone,two of the best angel novels written. Thus, Ididn'thave massively low expectations for my next angel novel. Combined with the glowing ratings and hype surrounding this story, I was really expecting something great. I feel as if whenever I go into a story expecting to hate it, I love it, and whenever I go into a novel expecting to love it, I usually hate it. I had a similar experience with this one.WhileUnearthlyhad an original premises which I found fascinating, it wasextremelyboring for more than half the story. It was like any other contemporary romance with Clara attending high school, fainting when she saw Mr. I-am-SO-hot-Christian, and attempting to get closer to him because she felt a romanticsparkbetween them. Yeah, nothing unique there, huh? I liked how Clara began to learn more about her angel abilities with her angel-blood friend, Angela, but either than that, everything about this story wassotypical.Speaking of Clara, her character simply grated on me. I think this might simply be an issue of personal preference, but Clara wasperfect.As in, she is an angel therefore she isliterallyperfect. Clara was beautiful. Clara had gorgeous hair. Clara could do any sport effortlessly. Clara could charm any guy she wanted. Clara could speak any language she wanted. Clara could do this perfectly. Clara could do that perfectly. Clara was a freaking perfect angel! I get it - Iknowshe's an angel - but it wassosilly.Whydid Clara need to be perfect? I love flawed characters and while Clara was flawed in the sense that shedidrebel against the laws of her angelic society and she foundsomethings hard, for the most part, I was just annoyed with her. Furthermore, I couldn’t connect with her in the least. Clara, you have a problem? Well, guess what? Us, humans? Wealwayshave problems, so suck it up! It seems harsh, but I wasextremelyirritated by this quality of hers. I think it became less problematic as the novel progressed, but it was glaringly obvious – and casted Clara into a petulant light actually – for the first half of the story.Once the half-way mark of this novel was passed, it began to pick up a little. I liked how Clara refused to be one of those girls who chased after a guy and her developing relationship with Tucker was sweet. IlovedTucker Avery - he iseverythingyou want a guy to be. In fact, I found him to be a littletooperfect actually which annoyed me ever-so-slightly. If you liked Zeke fromThe Immortal Rules,you'll probably adore Tucker. Yet, while I hated Zeke, I did manage to like Tucker, despite his perfection. While I found his reaction to Clara's angel background and his acceptance of certain actions they were forced to take during their relationshipveryunrealistic and too convenient, it was still bearable. Yet, I was rolling my eyes the moment the wordlovepopped into the picture. Yes, Clara and Tuckerdidlike each other, but love? Puh-lease, give me a break! Furthermore, Clara still feltdrawnto Christian which was simply irritating. I know she chose one of the guys, but it felt as if the plotstillhad love-triangle potential, which made me want to run away screaming.While Tucker is a complete gentleman, Christian is a total jerk. Yes, I mean it, a JERK. While he did perform a rather inexcusable act on the night of prom, it was even worse before that night when he refused to be seen in Clara's presence around his friends. Ihateguys like that and Christian, no matter how HOT he may have been, was no exception. Furthermore, I found the fact that Clara was so obsessed him to be rather startling andboring.I didn’tcareabout Christian. I didn’t understand how dating Christian was going to help her solve her purpose. I didn’t even understand why her mother was being such a stickler about her dating anyonebutChristian. Somehow, I neverfeltthe seriousness of this wholepurpose.Yes, I got that it was Clara’s fate or destiny, but that actual sense of urgency that should have sent my heart rate up and made me sit on the edge of my seat with panic and worry? Uh…yeah, that was missing.Majorly.WhileUnearthlybegan to wind down, we had an extra sub-plot of a fallen angel thrown in. Notice the key word: sub-plot. As in, not the main focus. In fact, it wassominiscule that I’m confused as to what role it even played in the plot of this story. In addition, the ending of this novel was nowhere near as shocking as other readers had extolled. It wasnotsuch a major plot twist and I, for one, was unimpressed by it. If anything, I’m annoyed with the ending ofUnearthly.It leaves alotof loose threads hanging, makes the reader question what exactly even happened during those lastthirty-five pages of action,and wonder whether picking up the sequel is even worth it. Yes, that’s right. 35/435 Pages of this novel were action. What were the other 400 Pages devoted to? High School. Prom. Romance. Flying. Teen Angst. Jerks. Just your usual, run-of-the-mill, dramatic teenage novel.In conclusion, while thereisa lot to love about this book, its execution falls flat. Its characters arewaytoo perfect, its romance is both convenient andnotlove even though it claims it is, the action its premises promises is miniscule, it throws in random sub-plots that only serve to make the reader confused andneedto pick up the sequel in annoyance, and the few characters who arenotperfect are simply annoying, irritating, or serve no purpose to the story. I like the idea ofUnearthlyand I like its writing and even the outline of its characters, but when you dig deeper and really analyze this novel, it’s nothing much but a standard Young Adult Paranormal Romance paraded around under a cover of hype, false originality, and very little true action to compensate for its flaws.Now, the million dollar question is... will I read the sequel? I think… no. While it probably will be a quick read, much likeUnearthlywas for me, I don't think I'm up for another dose of this world. I simply don't care for the characters enough and while some readers claim the sequel is better, most lowered their ratings ever-so-slightly, which meansIwill probably wind up givingHallowedOne Star. I think I'd rather just avoid writingthatsnarky review, thank you very much. Would I recommendUnearthly?If you haven’t readAngelfallorDaughter of Smoke and Bonethen yes, I would. For you, it’ll be a unique and utterly compelling read. I, however, was disappointed and extremely unimpressed by this one. With that, I am off to hide under my impenetrable fort - let the boulder-throwing begin!You can read this review and more on my blog,Ivy Book Bindings., error: Rating: 2.5 StarsI just want to let you all know that while I'm writing this, I am also building a fort. Yes, a fort to protect me from all the boulders and bombs that will most likely be thrown my way forhighlydisliking this novel. It doesn't matter that my fort is made of pillows or that it contains highly flammable books inside it - the point is, I have a fort. Thus, I hope you won't attack me since...well...I have a fort!Part 1: In Which I \"Get It\"I get it. I seriously do. Igetwhy there is so much hype surrounding this novel. Igetwhy you all love it. I really do.Unearthlyreleased during a time when angel novels such asHush, Hush, Hades,andFallenwere making waves - not all good - in the book community. Thus, in comparison with those novels,Unearthlyis truly a masterpiece. But, in my opinion, it's a masterpiece in the same way thatTwilightis a masterpiece when compared toFifty Shades of GreyorBeautiful Disaster.It's much better than the norm, but it isn'tthatgood at the same time.More about that later - back to why I \"get it.\" First and foremost,Unearthlyprovides a new and unique take on angel lore. Not only is it a story thatdoesn'tfeature a teenage girl falling in love with a fallen angel, it is also a story thatdoesn'tfeature insta-love or atruelove triangle. Yippee! Clara, the protagonist of our story, is one-fourth of an angel herself. In Hand's novel, angels are given a divine purpose in life that they must fulfill. As they grow into teenagers, they begin to get glimpses or visions of their purpose and must accordingly go about completing them. Thus, when Clara is given a vision of saving a handsome teenage boy from a fire, she and her family take off from California to Wyoming where she meets Christian, the boy of her dreams (literally!).Now, let me discuss the reasons why this novel really is quite good. First and foremost, I loved Clara's relationship with her mother, who is a half-angel. While I found it to be a little too perfect at some points, it was still nice to see her mother be such an active part of her life. Furthermore, I found that Clara's apprehensions about moving, her difficulty fitting into the social scheme at her new school, and her confusion over whether or not she is meant to get closer to Christian all handled quite realistically. In addition to Christian though, we have Tucker Avery - the annoying twin brother of Clara's best friend, Wendy. Tucker and Clara's relationship took a forefront in the second-half of the novel and I enjoyed how it was never rushed and it grew through conversation and the two spending time with each other.So, really, there's a lot to love about this book: (1) Original/Unique/New take on angel lore (2) No Missing Parent Syndrome (3) Quite realistic emotions (4) One heart-warming romance that grows through conversation. So, you might ask, what went wrong?Part 2: In Which I Don't Fall for the HypeYou see, despite having some excellent and interesting points,Unearthlywas actually a massive disappointment. I believe that this is primarily due to the order in which I read my angel books --> (1) Hush, Hush (2) Daughter of Smoke and Bone (3) Angelfall (4) Shadows (5) Unearthly <-- Do you see a problem here? No? Well, let me tell you. I read this novelafterreadingAngelfallandDaughter of Smoke and Bone,two of the best angel novels written. Thus, Ididn'thave massively low expectations for my next angel novel. Combined with the glowing ratings and hype surrounding this story, I was really expecting something great. I feel as if whenever I go into a story expecting to hate it, I love it, and whenever I go into a novel expecting to love it, I usually hate it. I had a similar experience with this one.WhileUnearthlyhad an original premises which I found fascinating, it wasextremelyboring for more than half the story. It was like any other contemporary romance with Clara attending high school, fainting when she saw Mr. I-am-SO-hot-Christian, and attempting to get closer to him because she felt a romanticsparkbetween them. Yeah, nothing unique there, huh? I liked how Clara began to learn more about her angel abilities with her angel-blood friend, Angela, but either than that, everything about this story wassotypical.Speaking of Clara, her character simply grated on me. I think this might simply be an issue of personal preference, but Clara wasperfect.As in, she is an angel therefore she isliterallyperfect. Clara was beautiful. Clara had gorgeous hair. Clara could do any sport effortlessly. Clara could charm any guy she wanted. Clara could speak any language she wanted. Clara could do this perfectly. Clara could do that perfectly. Clara was a freaking perfect angel! I get it - Iknowshe's an angel - but it wassosilly.Whydid Clara need to be perfect? I love flawed characters and while Clara was flawed in the sense that shedidrebel against the laws of her angelic society and she foundsomethings hard, for the most part, I was just annoyed with her. Furthermore, I couldn’t connect with her in the least. Clara, you have a problem? Well, guess what? Us, humans? Wealwayshave problems, so suck it up! It seems harsh, but I wasextremelyirritated by this quality of hers. I think it became less problematic as the novel progressed, but it was glaringly obvious – and casted Clara into a petulant light actually – for the first half of the story.Once the half-way mark of this novel was passed, it began to pick up a little. I liked how Clara refused to be one of those girls who chased after a guy and her developing relationship with Tucker was sweet. IlovedTucker Avery - he iseverythingyou want a guy to be. In fact, I found him to be a littletooperfect actually which annoyed me ever-so-slightly. If you liked Zeke fromThe Immortal Rules,you'll probably adore Tucker. Yet, while I hated Zeke, I did manage to like Tucker, despite his perfection. While I found his reaction to Clara's angel background and his acceptance of certain actions they were forced to take during their relationshipveryunrealistic and too convenient, it was still bearable. Yet, I was rolling my eyes the moment the wordlovepopped into the picture. Yes, Clara and Tuckerdidlike each other, but love? Puh-lease, give me a break! Furthermore, Clara still feltdrawnto Christian which was simply irritating. I know she chose one of the guys, but it felt as if the plotstillhad love-triangle potential, which made me want to run away screaming.While Tucker is a complete gentleman, Christian is a total jerk. Yes, I mean it, a JERK. While he did perform a rather inexcusable act on the night of prom, it was even worse before that night when he refused to be seen in Clara's presence around his friends.

            "Translation failed for: One star because the prose is lovely. Another because, I mean, I finished it.Despite my issues with Sarah Dessen (and they are numerous), I really enjoyedLock & Keyso I hoped that meant she was moving away from the crap that annoys me so much about her writing. Alas, it is not to be.I liveblogged reading this for a friend, so instead of writing up AGAIN why this book made me so furious and frustrated, I'll just copy and paste for you:pg. 33, a dude is all OOH YOU'RE THE HOTTEST GIRL to Auden who is just WALKING BY which is, OK, perhaps supposed to be high-school-era-smooth or dorky BUT it basically paints the world as a place where women who ignore street harassment as ungracious frigid bitches with little experience. AGGHHHH.pg. 43, OMG, \"maybe my mom could play the aloof, selfish bitch\" - first of all WTF, secondly, ever think that your mom IS OK with just doing dudes and not getting attached? LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE. OMFG.This is a general complaint, but I think Sarah Dessen should have written the book about Heidi because that is clearly what she cares about more. Shocking she'd pen this one right after having her own baby, Y/N?I had this problem with the Megan McCafferty books as well, but I hate books where girly-girls are to be mocked and patronized and feminists are to be mocked and patronized, because it is such bullshit that there is a respectable space where women are allowed to exist, where the societal conventions aren't taken too far but where feminism is for lesbians and harpies. And I fucking hate it. I fucking hate it too because I think it's such a real thing, not just in literature, I see it all the time. Let's laugh at the Elle Woods of the world but let's laugh at self-identifying feminists too. Bull. Shit.I hate being expected to remember people from all other Sarah Dessen books. Here's news: I DO NOT. I feel like I'm reading fanfiction for a series I never watched. I hate this self-referential bullshit.God I'm saying bullshit a lot.I'm not sure why it's so awful Auden's mom came to town with the hot grad student. Or at all. Mothers are allowed to have sex lives. It's generally how they became mothers.pg. 158, that whole street smarts/book smarts dichotomy? Scientists have done studies. IT DOESN'T EXIST. IT IS A WAY FOR STUPID PEOPLE TO PRETEND THEY ARE NOT STUPID. IT IS A WAY FOR INTELLECTUALS TO BE RUDE. IT IS NOT OK GAHHHH.pg. 160 and leading up to it, I cannot believe the reason it was OK for Auden to be talking to Eli WASN'T because people aren't fucking possessions but because actually Eli and Belissa (UGH BELISSA ALSO OF COURSE SHE HAS BAD SKIN AND A POINTY NOSE) are actually broken up DUH!I'm sorry, but \"hot dog party\" sounds more like a \"sausage party\" to me.OK I finished it while out and away from my computer, but, anyway, other issues:I hate the implication that the only way to truly let people into your life and not be a lonely bitch is romantic attachment.I also hate the idea that you're either a girl who is partially girly and details her life's minutiae or you are a lonely bitch. I don't even get why the mom is so lonely. I don't know many women who don't have a group of friends, unless they are awful people. Even serious academics hang out with other serious academics or writers or researchers or whatever else. I think the either/or dichotomy is another huge falsehood. Also: hanging out with a bunch of grad students who think you're awesome and want to discuss literature with you? Sounds pretty good. Sounds like a social life to me.HATE that Heidi and the dad end up together after all. He is awful. He had so much more to learn and yet that is mainly glossed over. I mean, men fare so much better in the Dessenverse.Also confused about how Heidi understands Auden's mom because she was a lonely bitch once too. Uh, except she is 26. I don't think you really had time, Heidi. Dessen really seems confused about when life happens, or at least that's how I see it.Eli is fine and all but does he have much to him besides biking and helping Auden with HER quest? If this was backwards, I would call a book sexist for making a girl exist primarily to help a dude find out who HE is. I want more. It's not fair to Eli, also I can accept why she'd spend time with him but I never felt their relationship was actually justified to me.Also, back to the Dessen Has No Idea When You Are Supposed To \"Grow Up\", why is whatshisface that Auden slept with and Maggie used to date such a huge asshole? He's 18 and sleeps with girls who he thinks are hot. Ohhhkay? I thought that was... being 18.OH AND EDITED TO ADD THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION... that Auden's mom's boyfriend basically stalks her into submission. That's a GREAT lesson!, error: Jedna gwiazdka, bo proza ​​jest cudowna. Druga, bo, mam na myśli, że ją skończyłam. Pomimo moich problemów z Sarah Dessen (a jest ich wiele), naprawdę podobała mi się Lock & Keys, więc miałam nadzieję, że oznacza to, że odchodzi od gówna, które tak mnie wkurza w jej pisarstwie. Niestety, tak nie jest. Prowadziłam livebloga podczas czytania dla przyjaciółki, więc zamiast pisać PONOWNIE, dlaczego ta książka tak mnie wkurzyła i sfrustrowała, po prostu skopiuję i wkleję dla ciebie: str. 33, facet mówi OOH JESTEŚ NAJGORĘTSZĄ DZIEWCZYNĄ do Auden, która po prostu PRZECHODZI, co jest, OK, może miało być gładkie lub dziwaczne w stylu licealnym, ALE zasadniczo maluje świat jako miejsce, w którym kobiety, które ignorują molestowanie uliczne, są niewdzięcznymi, oziębłymi sukami z niewielkim doświadczeniem. AGGHHHH. str. 43, OMG, „może moja mama mogłaby grać zdystansowaną, samolubną sukę” – po pierwsze WTF, po drugie, czy kiedykolwiek myślałeś, że twoja mama po prostu OK z facetami i nie przywiązywała się? WIELE OSÓB TAK. OMFG. To ogólna skarga, ale myślę, że Sarah Dessen powinna była napisać książkę o Heidi, ponieważ to jest to, na czym jej bardziej zależy. Szokujące, że napisała to zaraz po urodzeniu własnego dziecka, Y/N? Miałam ten sam problem z książkami Megan McCafferty, ale nienawidzę książek, w których dziewczęce dziewczyny są wyśmiewane i traktowane protekcjonalnie, a feministki są wyśmiewane i traktowane protekcjonalnie, ponieważ to takie gówno, że istnieje szanowana przestrzeń, w której kobiety mają prawo istnieć, w której konwenanse społeczne nie są posunięte za daleko, ale w której feminizm jest dla lesbijek i harpii. I kurwa tego nienawidzę. Kurwa, też tego nienawidzę, ponieważ myślę, że to taka prawdziwa rzecz, nie tylko w literaturze, widzę to cały czas. Śmiejmy się z Elle Woods tego świata, ale śmiejmy się też z samoidentyfikujących się feministek. Bzdura. Gówno. Nienawidzę, gdy oczekuje się ode mnie, że będę pamiętać ludzi ze wszystkich innych książek Sarah Dessen. Oto wiadomość: NIE WIEM. Czuję się, jakbym czytała fan fiction do serii, której nigdy nie oglądałam. Nienawidzę tego autoreferencyjnego gówna. Boże, często mówię bzdury. Nie wiem, dlaczego to takie okropne, że mama Audena przyjechała do miasta z gorącą studentką. Albo w ogóle. Matkom wolno mieć życie seksualne. Zazwyczaj tak zostają matkami. str. 158, ta cała dychotomia inteligencji ulicznej i mądrości książkowej? Naukowcy przeprowadzili badania. TO NIE ISTNIEJE. TO SPOSÓB DLA GŁUPICH LUDZI, BY UDAWALI, ŻE NIE SĄ GŁUPI. TO SPOSÓB DLA INTELEKTUALISTÓW, BY BYĆ NIEGRZECZNYM. TO NIE JEST OK GAHHHH. str. 160 i prowadząc do tego, nie mogę uwierzyć, że powodem, dla którego Auden mógł rozmawiać z Elim, NIE BYŁ fakt, że ludzie nie są pieprzonymi rzeczami, ale dlatego, że tak naprawdę Eli i Belissa (UGH BELISSA OCZYWIŚCIE MA ZŁĄ CERĘ I SZPICZASTY NOS) są w rzeczywistości rozłączeni, DUH! Przepraszam, ale „impreza z hot dogami” brzmi dla mnie bardziej jak „impreza z kiełbaskami”. OK, skończyłem ją będąc poza komputerem, ale w każdym razie inne kwestie: Nienawidzę sugestii, że jedynym sposobem, aby naprawdę wpuścić ludzi do swojego życia i nie być samotną suką, jest romantyczne przywiązanie. Nienawidzę również pomysłu, że jesteś dziewczyną, która jest częściowo dziewczęca i szczegółowo opisuje drobiazgi swojego życia, albo jesteś samotną suką. Nawet nie rozumiem, dlaczego matka jest taka samotna. Nie znam wielu kobiet, które nie mają grupy przyjaciół, chyba że są okropnymi ludźmi. Nawet poważni akademicy spotykają się z innymi poważnymi akademikami, pisarzami, badaczami lub kimkolwiek innym. Myślę, że dychotomia albo-albo to kolejne wielkie kłamstwo. A także: spędzanie czasu z grupą studentów, którzy uważają, że jesteś niesamowita i chcą z tobą rozmawiać o literaturze? Brzmi całkiem nieźle. Brzmi jak życie towarzyskie dla mnie. NIENAWIDZĘ tego, że Heidi i ojciec jednak kończą razem. On jest okropny. Miał tak wiele do nauczenia się, a mimo to jest to głównie pomijane. Mam na myśli, że mężczyznom wiedzie się o wiele lepiej w Dessenverse. Jestem też zdezorientowana, jak Heidi rozumie mamę Audena, ponieważ ona też kiedyś była samotną suką. No cóż, ma 26 lat. Nie sądzę, żebyś naprawdę miała czas, Heidi. Dessen naprawdę wydaje się zdezorientowana, kiedy życie się dzieje, albo przynajmniej tak to widzę. Eli jest w porządku i wszystko, ale czy ma w sobie coś więcej niż jazdę na rowerze i pomaganie Auden w JEJ misji? Gdyby to było odwrotnie, nazwałabym książkę seksistowską za to, że dziewczyna istnieje głównie po to, aby pomóc facetowi dowiedzieć się, kim ON jest. Chcę więcej. To nie fair wobec Eli, mogę też zaakceptować, dlaczego spędza z nim czas, ale nigdy nie uważałem, że ich związek był dla mnie uzasadniony. Wracając do Dessen Has No Idea When You Are Supposed To \"Grow Up\", dlaczego ten jakto, z którym Auden spał, a Maggie kiedyś się spotykała, jest takim wielkim dupkiem? Ma 18 lat i sypia z dziewczynami, które uważa za gorące. Ooo, dobra? Myślałem, że to... bycie 18-latkiem. O I EDYCJA, ABY DODAĆ, ŻE ZAPOMNIAŁEM WSPOMNIEĆ... że chłopak mamy Auden zasadniczo ją śledzi, aż się podporządkuje. To ŚWIETNA lekcja! --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: Pilgrim's Progress is about two delusional assholes wandering around being dicks to people, so it's basically a takeoff ofDon Quixote.But the dreaming narrator seems unconscious of the fact that the pilgrims are both jerks. I suppose it's possible that they're not supposed to be jerks at all, but...no, that can't be right. They'resuch jerks.It starts with a guy named Christian abandoning his family to wander off in search of a magical city. \"His wife and children...began to cry after him to return, but the man put his fingers in his ears, and ran on, crying Life! Life! Eternal life!\" It's pretty funny, in a mean kind of way, but irl abandoning your family to wander around looking for God is frowned upon. (\"Says who?\" goes Tolstoy, who did exactly this and then died of exposure in a train station.)So he takes off and immediately falls into the Slough of Despond (translation: \"Marsh of Bummers\"), and we immediately see that he's not only a dick (see above) but not very bright. He flails away through the mud, and as he's finally struggling out of it, some other guy comes by like what's up, and Christian is all \"as I was going thither I fell in here,\" and the dude is like, \"But why did you not look for the steps?\" Christian's all, \"There weresteps?\" Womp womp.And then he runs across some virgins. \"Come, good Christian, since we have been so loving to you, to receive you in our house this night...\" Woohoo, virgins! I guess it was pretty smart after all for him to run out on his family.He picks up his very own Sancho Panza along the way, a dude named Faithful - people have funny names in this book - and they recognize kindred dick spirits in each other; they will have great fun being mean to everyone else they meet for the rest of the book. Right away, for example, they run into a dude named Talkative, and they're just pricks to him for basically no reason. I guess Talkative's name is ironic or something because he actually does very little of the talking, and whenever he does open his mouth they just bag on him mercilessly:Faithful:Some cry out against sin even as the mother cries out against her child in her lap, when she calleth it slut and naughty girl, and then falls to hugging and kissing it....The proverb is true of you which is said of a whore, to wit, that she is a shame to all women; so are you a shame to all professors.Talkative:Since you are ready...to judge as rashly as you do, I cannot help but conclude that you are some peevish or melancholy man, not fit to be discourse with.Talkative has donenothingto infer that he's a sinner. Christian has heard rumors about him, that's all, and there's that unfortunate name and Faithful is like okay, good enough! And then they ditch him.Anyway, so then they pass through Vanity Fair, which has all kinds of stuff for sale, but they're like \"We buy the truth!\" which doesn't really make any sense but fine, save your money. Unfortunately the merchants are pissed off about that, so they torture and burn Faithful to death, which you're like holy shit, where did that come from? It's pretty gross. Luckily he's replaced by a guy named Hopeful who's exactly the same as Faithful in every way, so...whatever? If Christian's going to never mention Faithful again after watching him get tortured to death, I guess I won't either.So they ditch another guy or two, and sing some shitty songs - their idea of a fun chat is to sing shitty songs - and then Christian is all \"Oooh, shortcut!\" and of course they're captured by a giant and chained up in his dungeon for like a week, and he's about to kill them when - get this - suddenly Christian is like oh shit, I totally forgot, I have a magic key with me that will open anything. This is another ongoing theme: Christian just forgetting shit. It'll come up again later. So they unlock their chains and amble off, and Christian's like I know the way back, and Hopeful is like you know what, maybe I'll lead the way for a while, homie.Christian:Who could have thought that this path should have led us out of the way?Hopeful:I was afraid on it at the very first, and therefore gave you that gentle caution.They should have named him \"Passive Aggressive.\" They get lost again in no time, and once again they're eventually like oh shit, \"They also gave us a note of directions about the way, for our more sure finding thereof, but therein we have also forgotten to read.\" It's a miracle these two bumbling nincompoops ever make it anywhere at all. And let's just take a moment to point out that this issuper hella bad plotting.Like if you turned this in for your ninth grade fiction class - \"And then they remembered some magic stuff that's never been mentioned at any previous point but immediately it got them out of the trouble\" - your teacher would be like quit phoning it in, C-. Just in terms of pure literary value, how pleasant is it to read this book, it's trash.And then there's another case of them ditching a perfectly nice guy. His name is Ignorance, of all things, and he's like \"I'm a holy pilgrim too!\" but Christian is all,Why, or by what, art thou persuaded that thou hast left all for God and heaven?Ignorance:My heart tells me so.Christian:The wise man says, \"He that trusts his own heart is a fool.\" (Prov. 28:26)Ignorance:This is spoken of an evil heart, but mine is a good one...I will never believe that my heart is thus bad.Christian:Therefore thou never hadst one good thought concerning thyself in thy life.Ignorance:That is your faith, but not mine; yet mine, I doubt not, is as good as yours, though I have not in my head so many whimsies as you.Look, here's the thing: it's not this dude's fault his parents named him Ignorance. It was a dick move on their part, and sure, if it was me I might come up with a nickname like Igny or something, but I feel like Christian and Hopeful are judging him more by the name than by the perfectly innocuous things he says. This is an ongoing theme - people with bummer names getting shat on for it - and it just seems hella uncool.Anyway, Christian and Hopeful respond by wandering off while chanting at him, \"Well, Ignorance, wilt thou yet foolish be, To slight good counsel, ten times given thee?\" Actually chanting at him. It's moments like this that led George Bernard Shaw to describePilgrim's Progressas \"a consistent attack on morality and respectability, without a word that one can remember against vice and crime.\"Later on Ignorance will get to the gates of Heaven and it turns out that Christian and Hopeful are right: he totally doesn't get in. He is instead bound and thrown straight into Hell, so that sucks for him, and if you thought that this was going to be a book where Christian and Hopeful learn a valuable lesson at the end about not being dicks to absolutely everyone, this ending isn't going to satisfy you any more than Don Quixote's did.Because it turns out that the God of John Bunyan actually is Christian's God. This is the menacing, Puritan God our American forefathers sailed to America shrieking about - the oneSinners are in the Angry Hands of- and I don't care for Him. He is too much of a dick for me.The book itself has its moments. It's vividly written; there are exciting parts; it's not boring. But it's nowhere near as good as its exact contemporaryParadise Lost,which leads you to wonder about its enduring popularity. Is it just possible that Christians are so fond of it because it's quite a bit simpler than Milton?Because the fact is, Christian is not very bright., error: Pilgrim's Progress is about two delusional assholes wandering around being dicks to people, so it's basically a takeoff ofDon Quixote.But the dreaming narrator seems unconscious of the fact that the pilgrims are both jerks.

Life! Eternal life!\" It's pretty funny, in a mean kind of way, but irl abandoning your family to wander around looking for God is frowned upon. (\"Says who?\" goes Tolstoy, who did exactly this and then died of exposure in a train station.)So he takes off and immediately falls into the Slough of Despond (translation: \"Marsh of Bummers\"), and we immediately see that he's not only a dick (see above) but not very bright. He flails away through the mud, and as he's finally struggling out of it, some other guy comes by like what's up, and Christian is all \"as I was going thither I fell in here,\" and the dude is like, \"But why did you not look for the steps?\" Christian's all, \"There weresteps?\" Womp womp.And then he runs across some virgins. \"Come, good Christian, since we have been so loving to you, to receive you in our house this night...\" Woohoo, virgins! I guess it was pretty smart after all for him to run out on his family.He picks up his very own Sancho Panza along the way, a dude named Faithful - people have funny names in this book - and they recognize kindred dick spirits in each other; they will have great fun being mean to everyone else they meet for the rest of the book. Right away, for example, they run into a dude named Talkative, and they're just pricks to him for basically no reason. I guess Talkative's name is ironic or something because he actually does very little of the talking, and whenever he does open his mouth they just bag on him mercilessly:Faithful:Some cry out against sin even as the mother cries out against her child in her lap, when she calleth it slut and naughty girl, and then falls to hugging and kissing it....The proverb is true of you which is said of a whore, to wit, that she is a shame to all women; so are you a shame to all professors.Talkative:Since you are ready...to judge as rashly as you do, I cannot help but conclude that you are some peevish or melancholy man, not fit to be discourse with.Talkative has donenothingto infer that he's a sinner. Christian has heard rumors about him, that's all, and there's that unfortunate name and Faithful is like okay, good enough! And then they ditch him.Anyway, so then they pass through Vanity Fair, which has all kinds of stuff for sale, but they're like \"We buy the truth!\" which doesn't really make any sense but fine, save your money. Unfortunately the merchants are pissed off about that, so they torture and burn Faithful to death, which you're like holy shit, where did that come from? It's pretty gross. Luckily he's replaced by a guy named Hopeful who's exactly the same as Faithful in every way, so...whatever? If Christian's going to never mention Faithful again after watching him get tortured to death, I guess I won't either.So they ditch another guy or two, and sing some shitty songs - their idea of a fun chat is to sing shitty songs - and then Christian is all \"Oooh, shortcut!\" and of course they're captured by a giant and chained up in his dungeon for like a week, and he's about to kill them when - get this - suddenly Christian is like oh shit, I totally forgot, I have a magic key with me that will open anything. This is another ongoing theme: Christian just forgetting shit. It'll come up again later. So they unlock their chains and amble off, and Christian's like I know the way back, and Hopeful is like you know what, maybe I'll lead the way for a while, homie.Christian:Who could have thought that this path should have led us out of the way?Hopeful:I was afraid on it at the very first, and therefore gave you that gentle caution.They should have named him \"Passive Aggressive.\" They get lost again in no time, and once again they're eventually like oh shit, \"They also gave us a note of directions about the way, for our more sure finding thereof, but therein we have also forgotten to read.\" It's a miracle these two bumbling nincompoops ever make it anywhere at all. And let's just take a moment to point out that this issuper hella bad plotting.Like if you turned this in for your ninth grade fiction class - \"And then they remembered some magic stuff that's never been mentioned at any previous point but immediately it got them out of the trouble\" - your teacher would be like quit phoning it in, C-. Just in terms of pure literary value, how pleasant is it to read this book, it's trash.And then there's another case of them ditching a perfectly nice guy. His name is Ignorance, of all things, and he's like \"I'm a holy pilgrim too!\" but Christian is all,Why, or by what, art thou persuaded that thou hast left all for God and heaven?Ignorance:My heart tells me so.Christian:The wise man says, \"He that trusts his own heart is a fool.\" (Prov. 28:26)Ignorance:This is spoken of an evil heart, but mine is a good one...I will never believe that my heart is thus bad.Christian:Therefore thou never hadst one good thought concerning thyself in thy life.Ignorance:That is your faith, but not mine; yet mine, I doubt not, is as good as yours, though I have not in my head so many whimsies as you.Look, here's the thing: it's not this dude's fault his parents named him Ignorance. It was a dick move on their part, and sure, if it was me I might come up with a nickname like Igny or something, but I feel like Christian and Hopeful are judging him more by the name than by the perfectly innocuous things he says. This is an ongoing theme - people with bummer names getting shat on for it - and it just seems hella uncool.Anyway, Christian and Hopeful respond by wandering off while chanting at him, \"Well, Ignorance, wilt thou yet foolish be, To slight good counsel, ten times given thee?\" Actually chanting at him. It's moments like this that led George Bernard Shaw to describePilgrim's Progressas \"a consistent attack on morality and respectability, without a word that one can remember against vice and crime.\"Later on Ignorance will get to the gates of Heaven and it turns out that Christian and Hopeful are right: he totally doesn't get in. He is instead bound and thrown straight into Hell, so that sucks for him, and if you thought that this was going to be a book where Christian and Hopeful learn a valuable lesson at the end about not being dicks to absolutely everyone, this ending isn't going to satisfy you any more than Don Quixote's did.Because it turns out that the God of John Bunyan actually is Christian's God. This is the menacing, Puritan God our American forefathers sailed to America shrieking about - the oneSinners are in the Angry Hands of- and I don't care for Him. He is too much of a dick for me.The book itself has its moments. It's vividly written; there are exciting parts; it's not boring. But it's nowhere near as good as its exact contemporaryParadise Lost,which leads you to wonder about its enduring popularity. Is it just possible that Christians are so fond of it because it's quite a bit simpler than Milton?Because the fact is, Christian is not very bright. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

And that's another thing; she only spends like a day with the guy and already they're comfortable enough to kiss (well, he kissedher).Near the end we reach the scene when the Cullens are facing the newborns. That was a disappointment. Don't know if I'm spoiling or not, but the missing fight scene in Eclipse between the rest of the Cullens and the newborns is missing in this book too.

They believe the old myths, about the sun burning them (which is the way it should be if you ask me, none of that sparkle stuff!) and the stake through the heart thing, and they know nothing about Victoria and only refer to her asher. Diego and Bree befriend each other while hiding out in a cave underwater waiting for the sun to go down, and they start questioning some of the things they've been told. Diego 'experiments', and finds out that the sun really doesn't burn at all. So um, they want to go tell Riley, in case he doesn't already know, and they overhear him and Victoria talking with the Volturi (whom they know nothing about); turns out Jane wants Victoria to defeat the Cullens, and gives her five days to prepare the newborns before she wipes them out. So Diego waits up for Riley and Bree goes back to the house, and Riley comes home without Diego, and he starts training the newborns, who even when the time finally comes to fight the Cullens are too disorganized to do anything (he feeds them this lie that once every four years the sun can't hurt them so that they'll go outside). And, well, you know the rest. Bree doesn't see the wolves because Jasper has her eyes and ears closed after she surrenders. She thinks they're another breed of vampire. Here is where you can really sympathize with Bree whilst comparing her to the Cullens because she really doesn't know anything about vampire life. And, as you know, she never will.And that's basically it. I mean, itwasinteresting, but good for an online short than an actual book. It wasn't worth my time. I got a massive headache when I'd finished.P.s: no more vampires for me! I'm sick of all the blood. Between Twilight Saga and the Saga of Darren Shan, I'd go with Darren Shan for true vampire lovers (I repeat, VAMPIRE lovers, not VAMPIRE ROMANCE lovers).

            "Translation failed for: I know, I know. This book had police caution tape all around it warning me not to read. I wasn’t surprised that it was as bad as it is. Actually, I think that this book provides a good example of one of the central weaknesses of Stephenie Meyer’s books. I heard someone say the other day that the purpose of art is to make people feel. I know,doi, but I had never looked that one in the face before. Meyer spends most of her time, in all of her books, trying to cushion the reader from really feeling anything.It makes sense that she does this, since her writing started from what sounds to me like a sort oflimited self-counseling exercise. And, I think this is why her other books worked so spectacularly for me when they did – I already had so many feelings going on about so many different things that I was looking for comfort, not art. I think that’s also why they work for teenagers, whose emotions are an alternative energy source that I’m convinced could power the world. (The fact that they’re left in disuse is obviously some big oil conspiracy.) Her books are a fake, plastic world with fake, simple people. Her plots are driven by basic motivations and superpowers. I love it.Here, though, it worked out pretty unfortunately. You could feel that Meyer was writing it because her teacher assigned it to her and the due date had passed. In her introduction, she goes to great lengths to warn the reader that she might be forced to feel something at the end of the book; there was just no way for Meyer to get around it. It’s uncomfortable. This is another example of Meyer being unable to handle any of her characters winding up unhappy. I’m not complaining about that, necessarily, because I generally find it pretty funny in a sit-com kind of way. But in this case, I needed her to suck it up.The rest of this review will contain spoilers, but if you’ve readEclipse, as Ms. Meyer points out in the introduction, you already know about the timely (or untimely, if you consider how long and drawn out it is) end of Bree. Basically, the story breaks down into three parts:Act 1:The Cheeseburger of Pain. This is where Meyer is at her best. Two vaguely shallow high school kids with vaguely tragic pasts find each other and fall in love because they’re vaguely speshul. She describes their attraction in a style poignantly reminiscent of LOLcats (see thread* below). Also, they’re vampires. This is what I love in Meyer. It’s something that is both the easiest thing and the most impossible thing to make fun of because it’s already there making fun of itself. It is everything shallow in culture, and so it is absolutely beautiful. It is its own caricature.Act 2:The Metaphor of the Cave. This is where Meyer is on shaky ground - in consciously or unconsciously referencing other canonical works of writing. The title of the book, for example, is a major problem. Why would you rip off the title of one of the greatest short stories of the English language for a high school vampire romance? That is a problem. I feel genuine emotion when I think ofThe Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber, so you can’t just reference it flippantly. The title hurts my feelings a little bit. If she was genuinely and respectfully using theMacomberstory, then great, but I can’t figure a way that’s happening here.Anyway, what she is using (and it appears that she’s using it unconsciously, but maybe not) is Plato's metaphor of the cave:So, the premise of the story is that there are all these baby campires that an eeeevil campire is turning into a campire army. In the Twilight world, if you didn’t already know, vamps don’t dust if they go into sunlight, but they do get sparkly. BUT, the evil campire told the babes that theywilldust if they go into the light. So, they all believe this until they discover it’s not true in a very metaphor-of-the-cave kind of way. It’s funny, but also not, so it left me with an awkward neutral feeling. The cave was sitting right there, waiting to be referenced, but Meyer never explicitly did, and the revelation about sparkling didn’t turn into a metaphor for life. It fell a little flat.Act 3:Finding Forrester. There are, as I may have already ranted to you, so many reasons to be embarrassed for Gus Van Sant. Not the least of these reasons is the movieFinding Forrester. BecauseFinding Forresteris a perfectly fine movie, EXCEPT that it is exactly the same asGood Will Hunting, a movie that Gus Van Sant ALREADY made! That is so not okay. I actually think Van Sant has a lot of decent movie-making skills, but these choices he makes are so embarrassing to me. So, that’s what the last third ofBree Tanneris. It’s a recap of the end ofEclipse, but mostly in slo mo. It’s truly boring. It would have made so much sense to end this book after the cave metaphor. The repeat ending wasn’t revelatory, but more like explaining a joke. If we didn’t make the connections, then explaining it isn’t going to help.Overall, I’d say go see the newEclipsemovie instead. That movie pretty neatly combines what this book has to say with whatEclipsehas to say and is totally watchable, imho. It even has some great John Hughes moments, and I felt like it was laughing with me, not crying while I was laughing at it. If you can manage it, go when there are about 100 13-year-old girls in the theater, too.

            "Translation failed for: The two stars are mainly because of my history with this book, plus the fact that he wrote it for his son.I used to love these books, they were very favorite books when I read them and Riordan was, as far as I was concerned, a genius. Then I read some other things, and I got interested in some other books that became my favorites instead of these, but I still remembered these books as really, really great.Then, a couple of weeks ago, I reread the series. I had been reading about them online and hearing about them, mostly some negative things, and I was wondering if I had been wrong the first time I read them. Well, it turns out I was, at least in my opinion.First, the writing is junk. I am not saying the plot or the characters (yet), I am saying the writing. I recognized what I saw here, and I can recognize this in all of his kids books. This was a guy who didn't know how to write, and knew this about himself, but was clever, and put just enough more-or-less witty remarks and corny jokes in to distract the readers from the fact that he can't write. I recognize his inability to write in his adult books, too. Even though he has written many, many books by this point, both before and after Percy Jackson, he can't exactly write a book.The next thing which irritated me were the jokes on their own. Just bad. It was funny at times, I admit that. And in the first couple of chapters it's fine. But by the time you are third of the way into the first book and have been hearing these not-so-witty, not-so-funny \"jokes\" then I kind of just wanted to throw the book out of the window. When a series has a couple of remarks like this scattered about, and used at important times, then it's funny, or at least one can stand it. But just the jokes every five seconds were making me claw my own eyes out.Maybe I am being unreasonable about this one, but I found his portrayal of the Greek Gods and Goddesses to the very, very disrespectful. Particularly Dionysus got on my nerves. He was a God that, like all of the others, was worshipped by people for many years as a big part of their lives, and in Percy Jackson he is depicted as a loser he gets drunk on soda! Riordan does similar things with other Gods and Goddesses. I wouldn't mind them being in the series if he was just a bit more respectful.I also was bothered by the main character's dyslexia. Obviously, I was not bothered that the main character has dyslexia, what bothered me was how Riordan made having dyslexia be like. At one point, Percy (main character) sees a sign that says \"Private Event\" as \"Pirate Event\" I have researched dyslexia a lot (for personal reasons, long before I read Percy Jackson for the first time) and no one with dyslexia would have seen \"Private\" as \"Pirate\". In the fifth book, Percy sees \"Gods\" as \"Dogs\" not only is this one highly unlikely (if even possible), it also contrasts what he wrote in the first book. (For example, wouldn't he more likely see \"gods\" as \"os\", since he couldn't see the R or the V in \"Private\"?) . I feel like he could have made the dyslexia more realistic--it is not something to laugh about, it's a real obstacle in the lives of people who have it. This annoyed me the first time I read this book, too, but I got past it.This book series also totally copied Harry Potter, but without a lot of the things that made Harry Potter a work of art. Lots of books now have slightly copied minor things from that series, but never a complete copy, and never as bad as Riordan. For example, the main character has messy black hair and green eyes, and has never had many friends (Harry/Percy) and is raised by at least one abusive member of their family (The Dursleys'/ Percy's stepfather). Next, he finds out he is has magic and gets a special weapon (Harry's wand/Riptide) and he goes to school to learn about his magic (Hogwarts/Camp-half-blood) he meets a very wise teacher who he likes (Dumbledore/Chiron) and one teacher that he doesn't like (Snape/Dionysus. Though Snape was a much better and more complex character then Dionysus was in Percy Jackson). The main character's two best friends are boy who is very loyal, but not that smart (Ron/Grover) and girl who is brilliant but can be a little bit of a know-it-all sometimes (Hermione/Annabeth). There is a boy with longish blonde hair who is cruel to the main character (Malfoy/Luke), and a set of mischievous brothers (Fred and George/Travis and Connor) and set of twins where one dies (Fred and George/Caster and Pollux). The villain's name is not supposed to be said (Voldemort/Kronos), and at some point the main character is known for surviving something no one has before (Harry survived the killing curse/Percy reached sixteen), there is a character who is not in the series very much, but is very kind and nice to the main character, but he dies (Cedric/Beckendorf) and this character was also dating a girl who was nice enough but cried a lot (Cho Chang/Silena Beauregard). I could go on. It appears that Ridordan had a pretty good idea for a book series, but couldn't think of a plot so he found one that had already been used and was popular, but changed it slightly.In short, I can't think of Percy Jackson as anything more then a cheap, Harry Potter rip-off., error: The two stars are mainly because of my history with this book, plus the fact that he wrote it for his son.I used to love these books, they were very favorite books when I read them and Riordan was, as far as I was concerned, a genius. Then I read some other things, and I got interested in some other books that became my favorites instead of these, but I still remembered these books as really, really great.Then, a couple of weeks ago, I reread the series. I had been reading about them online and hearing about them, mostly some negative things, and I was wondering if I had been wrong the first time I read them. Well, it turns out I was, at least in my opinion.First, the writing is junk. I am not saying the plot or the characters (yet), I am saying the writing. I recognized what I saw here, and I can recognize this in all of his kids books. This was a guy who didn't know how to write, and knew this about himself, but was clever, and put just enough more-or-less witty remarks and corny jokes in to distract the readers from the fact that he can't write. I recognize his inability to write in his adult books, too. Even though he has written many, many books by this point, both before and after Percy Jackson, he can't exactly write a book.The next thing which irritated me were the jokes on their own. Just bad. It was funny at times, I admit that. And in the first couple of chapters it's fine. But by the time you are third of the way into the first book and have been hearing these not-so-witty, not-so-funny \"jokes\" then I kind of just wanted to throw the book out of the window. When a series has a couple of remarks like this scattered about, and used at important times, then it's funny, or at least one can stand it. But just the jokes every five seconds were making me claw my own eyes out.Maybe I am being unreasonable about this one, but I found his portrayal of the Greek Gods and Goddesses to the very, very disrespectful. Particularly Dionysus got on my nerves. He was a God that, like all of the others, was worshipped by people for many years as a big part of their lives, and in Percy Jackson he is depicted as a loser he gets drunk on soda! Riordan does similar things with other Gods and Goddesses. I wouldn't mind them being in the series if he was just a bit more respectful.I also was bothered by the main character's dyslexia. Obviously, I was not bothered that the main character has dyslexia, what bothered me was how Riordan made having dyslexia be like. At one point, Percy (main character) sees a sign that says \"Private Event\" as \"Pirate Event\" I have researched dyslexia a lot (for personal reasons, long before I read Percy Jackson for the first time) and no one with dyslexia would have seen \"Private\" as \"Pirate\". In the fifth book, Percy sees \"Gods\" as \"Dogs\" not only is this one highly unlikely (if even possible), it also contrasts what he wrote in the first book. (For example, wouldn't he more likely see \"gods\" as \"os\", since he couldn't see the R or the V in \"Private\"?) . I feel like he could have made the dyslexia more realistic--it is not something to laugh about, it's a real obstacle in the lives of people who have it. This annoyed me the first time I read this book, too, but I got past it.This book series also totally copied Harry Potter, but without a lot of the things that made Harry Potter a work of art. Lots of books now have slightly copied minor things from that series, but never a complete copy, and never as bad as Riordan. For example, the main character has messy black hair and green eyes, and has never had many friends (Harry/Percy) and is raised by at least one abusive member of their family (The Dursleys'/ Percy's stepfather). Next, he finds out he is has magic and gets a special weapon (Harry's wand/Riptide) and he goes to school to learn about his magic (Hogwarts/Camp-half-blood) he meets a very wise teacher who he likes (Dumbledore/Chiron) and one teacher that he doesn't like (Snape/Dionysus. Though Snape was a much better and more complex character then Dionysus was in Percy Jackson). The main character's two best friends are boy who is very loyal, but not that smart (Ron/Grover) and girl who is brilliant but can be a little bit of a know-it-all sometimes (Hermione/Annabeth). There is a boy with longish blonde hair who is cruel to the main character (Malfoy/Luke), and a set of mischievous brothers (Fred and George/Travis and Connor) and set of twins where one dies (Fred and George/Caster and Pollux). The villain's name is not supposed to be said (Voldemort/Kronos), and at some point the main character is known for surviving something no one has before (Harry survived the killing curse/Percy reached sixteen), there is a character who is not in the series very much, but is very kind and nice to the main character, but he dies (Cedric/Beckendorf) and this character was also dating a girl who was nice enough but cried a lot (Cho Chang/Silena Beauregard).

            "Translation failed for: This tract by Marx and Engels is too enormous in implication to review fully in the small little space that GR allows, so what I'll do for now is take extracts from it and comment on them, piece by piece.Per the Manifesto:\"\"Abolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists. On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution. The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital. Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty. But, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social. And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention, direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, etc.? The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class. The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation of parent and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour.Marx and Engels are here addressing a snapshot in time of European history. I don't have much knowledge of conditions during the industrial revolution in the rest of Europe, but have researched the situation relatively extensively as it was in Britain, as a background to a lot of criticism that was launched against the status quo by a lot of Victorian writers of fiction.In the feudal system, \"labor\" did not remove laborers from their families at all, in fact, it rather strengthened family ties since most of what can be seen as the proletariat of feudal times, were indebted laborers on the fiefdom of their feudal lord.So, the only labor which compromised the family situation, was the kind of labor done by men, women and children in mines and factories during the industrial revolution, from around 1750 to the early 1900's.If you read up on reforms in Britain, you will see that by about 1831, public outcries against child labor and the conditions that adults and children were made to work under in mines, caused public commissions to be instituted by government, which started a slow and gradual reform of conditions via legislation, to the point that all kinds of laborers are pretty well-protected and well-represented at the present day.Ironically, the big bad fat cats these days are not the kind that deal with direct labor, but rather the type who deal in/with secondary products (like financial products) and services. (By services we do not mean of the \"labour\" kind that Marx addressed- Marx was addressing the kind of workers who were exploited in mines and factories.)Note that the industrial revolution, although it started off bringing such untold misery to so many, also had the following effect: average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. In the two centuries following 1800, the world's average per capita income increased over tenfold, while the world's population increased over sixfold. Finally it was within the grasp of those born outside of nobility to make a decent living for themselves.A lot of workplace reform has taken place since the IR started.. and not through rabble-rousers like Marx, but because people with a conscience raised their voices and cried out against the injustices being done by capitalists against fellow human beings.Authors like Charles Dickens, for instance, and Victor Hugo, helped to encourage the privileged to look upon their less fortunate brethren with greater sympathy, and to call for social reform in the name of conscience....so, Karl Marx is being a great opportunist here. At a time when history and society is in great flux and inner revolution, when a new era is dawning and social conscience still needs to become cognizant of the suffering of some of the members of society, Karl Marx exploits the situation, ironically by making use of the exploitation by one element of society, of another.It is the poor and the ignorant that is being exploited, and Karl Marx exploits their helplessness, ignorance and gullibility to shout for revolution instead of evolution. Marx and Engels call for violence where no violence is necessary, because peaceful change was already taking place in any case.Per the manifesto:But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus. The bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women. He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production. For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial. Our bourgeois, not content with having the wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives. Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.The implication is obvious. According to the authors, the implication is that marriage is a bourgeois, patriarchal institution for the exploitation of women, a form of prostitution. You would think that anybody who is even in the slightest familiar with history, would be able to see immediately how fallacious and false such an accusation is, since marriage is a social institution that evolved gradually over many centuries, but has always been something that protected rather than exploited women. Remember, for centuries and centuries, women had no recourse save sexual abstinence (for which the best path was to become a nun) against falling pregnant.Women had exactly three choices: Be a prostitute, be a nun, or have the protection of marriage, where you could at least have the privilege of raising your children in a protected environment, and in which the father of the child had the responsibility to care for the children and their mother on a material level.It is only through birth control, which we at last have 99% effective technology for, that woman is emancipated from the hearth and can take her place next to males as a fully economically productive partner, since she doesn't have to be tied down in a perpetual cycle of pregnancy, childbirth and nursing anymore.This has nothing to do with the bourgeoisie except that it was people out of the horrible, terrible ranks of those dastardly bourgeoisie, that modern medicine was developed, modern medicine, which keeps child- and maternal mortality at bay, has brought better health to people of all walks and stations in life, and has given us the technology to be able to choose when we do or don't have children. (..except if you let The Pope tell you, of course).I have an overwhelming feeling that Marx was simply exploiting women's emancipation movements to gain more supporters for Communism, when he says the following:He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production.Yes, women were being marginalized, but by the fact that we were excluded from property holding rights (something Marx scorns in any case) and from having an equal right to vote (something else which he scorns too).Let's analyze this carefully:How are bourgeois malesexploitingwomen by marrying them? ..by having sex with them and expecting of them to have children? ..but it is usuallywomenwho want children in the first place. Certainly, in feudal times,childrensons were deemed an essential item for males to acquire in order to continue the family line, but, since the human species would discontinue should women stop having children, calling it an exploitation of women by men sounds like a rather strange, roundabout way of putting things.Certainly in the time that capitalism has steadfastly taken root, children have become really more of a liability financially speaking, than a prize...and calling a married woman more of a prostitute than an unmarried woman would be, who will still be used for sex, just this time by the entire mob instead of her husband, (unless the married woman decides to swing which will be HER decision to cuckold her husband - unless they both agree to swing) just sounds a bit crazy.In fact, if you think about it, it isMarxwho is making the implication that women are mere objects, property to be owned like cows or camels, by suggesting that they will be seen as fair game (\"community of women\", as he puts it, having a similar meaning to \"community of property\") under Communist rule.I just can't help finding his attitude massively patronizing and insulting, both towards men and women, as much as I decry the patriarchy of the past, because Marx himself is speaking with the very voice of patriarchy and sexism that he supposedly decries. He speaks their language, the language of the white, supremacist patriarchal 'master'.Also from the manifesto:\"The education of all children,from the moment that they can get along without a mother's care, shall be in state institutions at state expense.\"...and our children must be taken away from us and brought up in some state institution. See:Communist Party Education Workers Congress, Communist quotes:We must create out of the younger generation a generation of Communists. We must turn children, who can be shaped like wax, into real, good Communists.... We must remove the children from the crude influence of their families. We must take them over and, to speak frankly, nationalize them. From the first days of their lives they will be under the healthy influence of Communist children's nurseries and schools. There they will grow up to be real Communists.It is generally accepted knowledge that institutionalized care away from any sort of notion of family, is psychologicallyunhealthy for children.See:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstit.....so Marx wants to pull down the very fabric of society, to the point of removing even the notion of family - to remove from children the prerogative of having your own mother and father, of having brothers and sisters, and instead, humans must become cogs in the wheel of Communism, mindless automatons who have no individuality, no sense of self.No thanks, I don't buy into the hive-mind insect-think.This review is a work in progress, so more to follow soon.EDIT: Dear reader, if you feel you need to comment,pleasetake the time to read the discussion thread below first - these issues and even more regarding Marxism, Communism, etc, are discussed EXTENSIVELY in the comment thread below, and I fear that comments are starting to become repetitive, with clear indications that commentors are not bothering to check if their arguments might already have been discussed a few times over. Unfortunately all that is discussed cannot be worked into the review itself, since GR limits review space, and this is a HUGE subject.I'd also like to mention that I am absolutely to a large extent a fan of Socialism in general and a great fan of the Scandinavian mixed system. What I am criticizing in this review, is specifically this document, 'The Communist Manifesto', and not Socialism itself.I promise to make time soon to work more of the discussions into the review itself, but some very well-read and intelligent Marxian apologists have commented, so it might be worth your time to read the discussions in any case.Thanks. :), error: This tract by Marx and Engels is too enormous in implication to review fully in the small little space that GR allows, so what I'll do for now is take extracts from it and comment on them, piece by piece.Per the Manifesto:\"\"Abolition of the family!

Remember, for centuries and centuries, women had no recourse save sexual abstinence (for which the best path was to become a nun) against falling pregnant.Women had exactly three choices: Be a prostitute, be a nun, or have the protection of marriage, where you could at least have the privilege of raising your children in a protected environment, and in which the father of the child had the responsibility to care for the children and their mother on a material level.It is only through birth control, which we at last have 99% effective technology for, that woman is emancipated from the hearth and can take her place next to males as a fully economically productive partner, since she doesn't have to be tied down in a perpetual cycle of pregnancy, childbirth and nursing anymore.This has nothing to do with the bourgeoisie except that it was people out of the horrible, terrible ranks of those dastardly bourgeoisie, that modern medicine was developed, modern medicine, which keeps child- and maternal mortality at bay, has brought better health to people of all walks and stations in life, and has given us the technology to be able to choose when we do or don't have children. (..except if you let The Pope tell you, of course).I have an overwhelming feeling that Marx was simply exploiting women's emancipation movements to gain more supporters for Communism, when he says the following:He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production.Yes, women were being marginalized, but by the fact that we were excluded from property holding rights (something Marx scorns in any case) and from having an equal right to vote (something else which he scorns too).Let's analyze this carefully:How are bourgeois malesexploitingwomen by marrying them? ..by having sex with them and expecting of them to have children? ..but it is usuallywomenwho want children in the first place. Certainly, in feudal times,childrensons were deemed an essential item for males to acquire in order to continue the family line, but, since the human species would discontinue should women stop having children, calling it an exploitation of women by men sounds like a rather strange, roundabout way of putting things.Certainly in the time that capitalism has steadfastly taken root, children have become really more of a liability financially speaking, than a prize...and calling a married woman more of a prostitute than an unmarried woman would be, who will still be used for sex, just this time by the entire mob instead of her husband, (unless the married woman decides to swing which will be HER decision to cuckold her husband - unless they both agree to swing) just sounds a bit crazy.In fact, if you think about it, it isMarxwho is making the implication that women are mere objects, property to be owned like cows or camels, by suggesting that they will be seen as fair game (\"community of women\", as he puts it, having a similar meaning to \"community of property\") under Communist rule.I just can't help finding his attitude massively patronizing and insulting, both towards men and women, as much as I decry the patriarchy of the past, because Marx himself is speaking with the very voice of patriarchy and sexism that he supposedly decries. He speaks their language, the language of the white, supremacist patriarchal 'master'.Also from the manifesto:\"The education of all children,from the moment that they can get along without a mother's care, shall be in state institutions at state expense.\"...and our children must be taken away from us and brought up in some state institution. See:Communist Party Education Workers Congress, Communist quotes:We must create out of the younger generation a generation of Communists. We must turn children, who can be shaped like wax, into real, good Communists.... We must remove the children from the crude influence of their families. We must take them over and, to speak frankly, nationalize them. From the first days of their lives they will be under the healthy influence of Communist children's nurseries and schools. There they will grow up to be real Communists.It is generally accepted knowledge that institutionalized care away from any sort of notion of family, is psychologicallyunhealthy for children.See:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstit.....so Marx wants to pull down the very fabric of society, to the point of removing even the notion of family - to remove from children the prerogative of having your own mother and father, of having brothers and sisters, and instead, humans must become cogs in the wheel of Communism, mindless automatons who have no individuality, no sense of self.No thanks, I don't buy into the hive-mind insect-think.This review is a work in progress, so more to follow soon.EDIT: Dear reader, if you feel you need to comment,pleasetake the time to read the discussion thread below first - these issues and even more regarding Marxism, Communism, etc, are discussed EXTENSIVELY in the comment thread below, and I fear that comments are starting to become repetitive, with clear indications that commentors are not bothering to check if their arguments might already have been discussed a few times over. Unfortunately all that is discussed cannot be worked into the review itself, since GR limits review space, and this is a HUGE subject.I'd also like to mention that I am absolutely to a large extent a fan of Socialism in general and a great fan of the Scandinavian mixed system. What I am criticizing in this review, is specifically this document, 'The Communist Manifesto', and not Socialism itself.I promise to make time soon to work more of the discussions into the review itself, but some very well-read and intelligent Marxian apologists have commented, so it might be worth your time to read the discussions in any case.Thanks. :) --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

She is a woman who \"has no apparatus except gut fear and female cunning... she may fall back on superstition, or take up a useful hobby like embroidery, or go mad, or marry a disk jokey\" (p. 12).

Well, it's ok because she liked it and wants to keep doing it, just as she wants to continue relying on his support on her quest.Who is Pynchon kidding? Satire, MY ASS. You DON'T get to satire women into submissive, subservient roles of clueless, insecure, emotional messes who stumble through life while being used and molested by men.I mean, you can, but don't expect this woman to take you seriously on any other matter.I was so aghast at what I was reading that I did a bit of research into Pynchon's life and it seems he was not a rabid right-winger (he's a postmodernist, after all!). Also, he wrote this in the 60s - for God's sake, the second wave of feminism was well underway!The Second Sexfor example, appeared in 1949.

Some preliminary discussions:Science: Most of us probably remember at least the term \"entropy\" from high-school physics - basically thermodynamic laws dictate that the entropy of a physical system increases over time (i.e. disorder increases. For example, if you put a bunch of multi-colored balls in a box, they tend to get mixed up over time; they do not tend to sort themselves by color. Maxwell, Plank et all ran experiments like this but on particles).Math: In info theory (which is distinct from physics because it refers to a purely abstract field of \"information\"), another measure of entropy is defined, and it turns out its mathematical equation is virtually the same as that used by physicists (who would have thought, the concepts we come up to mathematically describe abstract situations are based on our real world experiences?). Theoretically information entropy measures the probability that we can predict the outcome. And, the more we know, it turns out, the less we can predict the outcome, because there's so many more possibilities to take into consideration (\"The more you know, the more you realize you don't know\" type of thing).Maxwell's Demonis a supposed paradox about how a decrease in entropy/disorder could occur (no paradoxes exist in science or math; all is clear once one has adequate insight and knowledge). Theoretically, the thought experiment goes, we could have an invisible demon sitting there opening and closing a flap and thus magically guiding all red balls to one side of the box, and all blue balls to the other. In this case, disorder would decrease. Supposedly. Of course, it's quite easy to refute this paradox the moment you realize that the demon could not possibly exist as described, because apure information deciderwould need to beembodiedin some physical way. The moment you MAKE this demon out of physical materials, the moment this demon becomes incarnate, it's clear that the demon ispart of the systemand thus, while the disorder of the BOX might decrease, the laws of entropy are NOT violated by the NET system, including the demon.---I credit Pynchon for creatively satirizing this futile quest for ultimate Order/Truth. The ethos of modernity has been the search for Order/Absolute Truth - only, we have realized, in all fields, that the more we know, and the more we try to organize things, the more they slip out from under out control as net systems becomes increasingly chaotic. Just look at particle physics - in seeking to describe the ultimate nature of reality, physicists cooked up a veritable \"zoo\" of particles (their word, not mine), ever more ridiculous in its complexity (so much for the \"Grand Unified Theory\", which I consider a theoretically impossible quest, because of the laws of entropy).There's a lot to be examined here, but it's been donealready(many other times, too but that's a good place to start), and I'm not in the mood to be kind.

            "Translation failed for: Okay then... this is one of those times where I truly wonder if I've read the same book as everyone else. People are blindly praising this novel without acknowledging how screwed up Annie and Sophie are. There aren't that many reviews yet, so I'm going to make a note to myself to check back here at the end of the month and see if anything changes.There are a whole slew of witchy books I want to read that are coming out this October, butCacklewas at the top of my list. I think I was mistaken about the premise, though. Someone on TikTok labeled it as LGBTQ+, so I was falsely expecting a sapphic witchy tale. Nonetheless, though, I found the premise intriguing: Annie has recently been dumped by her boyfriend of ten years. She's devastated and needs some space, so she takes a teaching job a few hours away and moves to a picturesque, small town. Everyone seems really friendly, and she befriends a gorgeous, glamorous woman named Sophie. The closer they become, though, the more something seems off. Why are the townspeople afraid of Sophie? Is she really as warm and friendly as she seems? Healing from a breakup by bonding with a hot witch sounds like a fantastic premise to me. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get behind it as I read.Your enjoyment ofCacklewill probably depend on how much you sympathize with Annie. I couldn't stand her. She's so whiny. She spends the entire book rambling on about missing her ex. Sure, they were together for ten years, so she had a right to be upset. But the way she had no personality or hobbies outside of him frustrated me. He so clearly never appreciated her, yet she devoted her life and ruined all of her relationships for him.Annie's entire approach to men made me roll my eyes. She talks about how she can't live alone and always cycles through guys. Growing up, when her friends told her she spent too much time with her boyfriends, she got mad and stopped talking to them out of spite. She never grew out of that dependence on a man. She's also extraordinarily sensitive and takes every single passing remark by other characters the wrong way and never gets over anything. She was bullied as a kid, but mostly in the way of random insensitive comments from other children, rather than one bully targeting her... And she never forgets it and is still wishing ill on everyone who has ever made a slightly rude comment to her. It's exhausting, and she seemed so cold for no reason to everyone but Sam and Sophie that I couldn't get behind her.She does grow at the end, but it's literally in the last 5% of the book that she changes her mind. She had this weird trajectory where she started believing in herself in the second half, mostly to placate Sophie, but then immediately threw it all away for Sam, and then did a last second switcheroo where she realized she could, in fact, survive without a man. I had a hard time believing any of it.I also thought Sophie was extremely toxic. She made some good points, but her actions were pretty despicable. I supported her sentiments that Annie needed to move on and believe in herself. She's right that society pushes women to feel like they need a man in their lives, and, as a result, women end up settling because they don't know they deserve better. However, she was way too controlling and didn't give Annie any room to come to those conclusions on her own. She physically took her phone from her, encouraged Annie to drink way too much every weekend, was too possessive over Annie's time, and eventuallygave her a pet so that she could monitor Annie's every movement in her own home. Oh, andshe drugged herwith zero remorse. That's abusive behavior! Not to mention all the lies and manipulation. She's an interesting villain, but I'm frustrated to see people saying that she's empowering and in the right.I'm spending so much time harping on the characters because they truly are the focus of the story. There's not much plot or depth beyond the characterization. In fact, there are so so many things left unexplained and zero answers about the magic systemOR HOW ANNIE BECAME A WITCH. Please correct me if I missed it, but my own personal theory is that Sophie somehow gave her powers (maybe with that ring?). I'm floored that it was never explained. I think it's probably fine if you like the characters, but if you don't, then the cracks show and there's not really anything else to enjoy. The writing is fine, but I didn't feel strongly about it one way or the other. I was listening on audiobook, though, and I have a harder time judging writing when I'm listening. FWIW, the narrator was good (it's the same woman who narratesLock Every Door), though I didn't love the voice she used for Sophie.Kind of spoilers for the end below here, but I'm not tagging them because they're vague. If you don't want to know the direction of the story, stop reading after this paragraph. Overall, it just wasn't for me, mostly because I thought the characters were all bad people, in a rude, unentertaining way. It did have spooky vibes, but it almost felt like the author was including too many food and coffee references just for the sake of it. It felt more like a random grocery list sprinkled in than the coziness and October atmosphere I was hoping for (sometimes less is more! Tell me HOW the pie smelled and tasted, rather than giving me twenty different baked goods).Giving this book the benefit of the doubt, I could say Harrison was intentionally trying to make the characters unlikable. I do really like stories where protagonists become antagonists and the bad guys win. They're so fun and interesting! Arguably, that's what this book does, but I didn't have fun. Sophie and Annie try to pass their behavior near the end off as feminist and empowering, but I found it to just be mean for the sake of being mean without a greater purpose. I love sinister villains with a morally grey reason for their behavior... but Sophie and Annie were petty and took things too far. Maybe if they actually got to know the townspeople instead ofbending them to their wills with magicthey'd all get along. Sure, you can stand up for yourself and take what you want out of life, but you don't have to ostracize yourself in the process.I liked the themes of this book, but I couldn't quite tell how far the reader was supposed to go with them. Should we root for Sophie and Annie? Are we supposed to dislike them and view Sophie as the traditional mean witch living in a forest out of a fairytale? I dunno, but I didn't have a good time.2 stars. I do see how some people might like this-- it's unique and liking Annie might give you a different perspective than I had.

People are blindly praising this novel without acknowledging how screwed up Annie and Sophie are.

I think I was mistaken about the premise, though. Someone on TikTok labeled it as LGBTQ+, so I was falsely expecting a sapphic witchy tale. Nonetheless, though, I found the premise intriguing: Annie has recently been dumped by her boyfriend of ten years. She's devastated and needs some space, so she takes a teaching job a few hours away and moves to a picturesque, small town.

            "Translation failed for: | |blog|tumblr|ko-fi| |For a book published in the 90sThe Kitchen God's Wifecomes across as strangely outdated. And I guess in spite of Tan's writing—which is far from mediocre or incompetent—I could not look past the fact that her story was the antithesis of female solidarity.At first I was taken by Tan's storytelling. The first 40 pages or so, those that take place in the 'present', were enjoyable. We learn that Pearl, a woman in her thirties, has always had a difficult relationship with Winnie, her mother. Some of this is due to generational and cultural differences but, as we soon learn, both mother and daughter have kept secrets from each other. When Winnie's sister-in-law Helen/Hulan announces that she can no longer keep silent about their past, Winnie is forced to recount her many trials and hardships to her daughter. This is where the novel lost me. I find this kind of cheesy melodrama meets misery porn to be exceedingly frustrating. Winnie is basically Cinderella or the classic Mary Sue: 99% of people around her use her and abuse her. Every female character, with the exception of Grand Auntie Du, is cruel, vain, stupid, ugly, and or ungrateful. Winnie, on the other hand, is an angel. She is not like other girls. She endures and she suffers because she has aspirations to martyrdom.Given that she is recounting past experiences directly—ie we get a 1st pov—you would think that at one point or another Winnie could express uncertainty over the accuracy of her memories or wonder if others recall things differently. But no! She keeps insisting that 'this is what happened' and that Helen is a liar who remembers things wrong. And, speaking of Helen, rather than painting a complex and fraught friendship, Tan presents us with the goody two shoes Winnie and the ugly, stupid, and venal Helen who is not only a horrible friend to Winnie but a lousy human being.Anyway, Winnie recounts her tragic past: her mother abandons her, she is shunned by her wealthy father and raised by cartoonishly wicked relatives. In relating these experiences Winnie alway makes a point of emphasising her inherent goodness and beauty, often by making little digs about women's failings. Winnie ends up marrying a horrible man who possess only vices. Her reminded me of the 'bad' men fromThe Giver of Starsand novels by Kristin Hannah. Personally, I prefer more nuanced characters. Tan also often conflates a characters' physical appearance with their personality—so if one has an ugly character they will be indeed 'ugly' on the outside—which feels a tad...old-fashioned? Maybe it would be more suited to a novel dated from the 19th century than the 1990s.The only sections that were somewhat interesting and whinging-free were the ones that stuck to facts. For example, when Tan writes details statics and about the Sino-Japanese War (as opposed to Winnie's own experiences in it). When she writes of Nanking I felt much more horrified and moved than I was by anything related to Winnie.Sadly, Winnie's narrative is more intent on dissing on Helen than anything else. Here are some the lovely things she says/thinks about Helen: “Her mouth dropped open to let this thought come in and nourish her brain. I was thinking, Good, even though she is uneducated, she is quick to learn something new.” / “She was plump, but not in that classical way of a peach whose pink skin is nearly bursting with sweetness. Her plumpness was round and overflowing in uneven spots, more like a steamed dumpling with too much filling leaking out of the sides. She had thick ankles and large hands, and feet as broad as boat paddles. ” / her hair was “lumpy” / she had no sense of fashion, none at all.” / “a simple country girl”.And Winnie goes on to tell Pearl that: “I am not being critical in remembering her features just because I am angry with her now”. Sure hon, go on and keep lying to yourself. Winnie never takes any responsibility. Everything is and or always was all Helen's fault. Helen is ugly inside and out, “she broke harmony between us. I tell you, that day Hulan showed me her true character. She was not the soft melon head she made everyone believe she was. That girl could throw out sharp words, slicing fast as any knife”. And of course, “She’s the complaining one, not I”. I'm not so sure about that one Winnie...the story ended up being less about domestic abuse, war, and survival, then a woman going on and on about how her 'supposed' friend is a trash human being.I swear, every few pages, Winnie would say something such as: “Who is the better cook? You see! I am not boasting. It’s true. ” / “You know what I think? When Jiaguo got his promotion, Hulan gave herself a promotion too! In her mind, she was more important than I was. ” / “She was always unhappy until I was the same level of unhappy as she was.” / “You would think Hulan would remember those hard little cakes, and then put a few coins, or maybe some food, into the beggar girl’s bowl, which is what I did. I’m not saying I did this all the time. But Hulan did not do this even once. Instead she put more food into her own mouth. She added fat onto her body the same way a person saves gold or puts money into a bank account, something she could use if worse came to worst.” / “So you see, I think it was some little river crabs Hulan wanted to eat in Changsha. That’s what made us sick. It stayed in our bodies and broke out one day.” / “She will probably tell you it was instant true love. Maybe for him. But I think she was being practical”....and I cannot stand this lousy portrayal of female 'friendship'. Women, with the exception of Winnie, are catty and fake. Men, with the exception of Winnie's Chinese-American second husband—are stupid, cowardly, or abusive sadists.Other girls Winnie encounters also receive a similar treatment to Helen's one. Winnie sometimes pretends to be nice (claiming that she didn't hate a woman before stressing how selfish or unkind that woman was) but, in actuality, she is anything but. She describes a girl she dismisses as “stuck-up” as having “red as a demon’s” eyes. Her first husband's new wife is not only “bossy” in both attitude and appearance but “stupid” (“You see how stupid his new wife was?”). Winnie also makes some weird comments about Burmese and Cantonese people, seems to relish the idea that Peanut, yet another cruel/vain girl, “who used to pride herself on the paleness of her skin. And now she was almost as dark as a Cantonese!”.And yes, sure, Winnie suffers. Her husband is a monster with no redeeming qualities and with the exception of Grand Auntie Du and her American-born husband...well, everyone else is bad news.I dislike this kind of 'girl-on-girl hate' and the whole Winnie=Cinderella thing was annoying.Thankfully, I bought my copy of this book in a second-hand shop (then again, I will never get back the hours I spent reading this).

            "Translation failed for: I'm immensely disappointed.Before going into a LONG rant, let me first put out a disclaimer: I was born and raised in China, and this is the first time that I attempted a novel from a Chinese-American author. My background inevitably affected my reading experience -- up to the 80% mark I was going to give this book 3.5 stars, and thought that if I had only an average American's knowledge of Chinese culture, it could've been 5 -- but it was the last 20% that ruined the book for me, for entirely different reasons.That said, let's get started.The GoodThe Poppy War is fast-paced and moves through three distinct phases in the life of our main character Rin. Part 1 centers around her training at a military school, pushing her limits to survive the trials and win respect from her discriminating classmates. The stakes are high and some scenes get quite gritty, but there are also a lot of hilarious moments and the master-apprentice dynamics are heartwarming. This part has a strong YA vibe which is not my usual type, but I found it surprisingly enjoyable and could easily relate to Rin as a character.Part 2 takes on a big change in tone. Rin joins her friends and foes alike from school in a war against her country's island neighbor, meanwhile learning to wield her newly-found shaman power. The themes get considerably darker, with lots of battle scenes and graphical violence. This part was the highlight of the book for me: I loved all the battle tactics, the detailed planning and execution, the deception and manipulation. The general outline of events mimics that of the Sino-Japanese War, and a lot of parallels were drawn, but the strategies were quite original and I appreciate all the effort that the author put into it.Part 3 is where the book gets stamped as grimdark. After an astonishing turn of events, Rin and her comrades find themselves in dire situations where they have to make difficult decisions to save their country. I have major issues with thepurposeof certain scenes in this section, which I will explain further below, but I admire the fact that Kuang thought of including them in the first place. Too many atrocities were committed during WWII, and too many of them remain little known outside the countries where they occurred. As someone who shares heritage and history with Kuang, I think her intention is respectable and it's important to have such voices heard.Sadly, just like many other things in this book, her ideas are great, but the execution far from it.The BadThe worldbuilding is lazy to say the least, and very problematic in my opinion.First, let's get one thing straight: Nikan is not inspired by China. ItisChina. Simply changing some names into a different language doesn't make it a different country (Nikan means \"Chinese people\" in Manchurian). Here's why:- The texts Rin studies in chapter 1,Mengzi,Zhuangzi, andFuzi(Chinese spelling for Confucius), as well as the strategy text used at Sinegard,Sunzi(Chinese spelling for Sun Tzu), are real classics studied throughout history in China. Thekejuis also a real test, but more on that later.- The various types of foods, including the fancy dishes that appeared in chapter 8, are real dishes in China, although some of their names are modified (Eight Treasure Congee becomes Seven Treasure Soup, etc.). The trinkets sold by the street vendors in that chapter are also real toys for Chinese kids, and shadow play is a real hereditary art.- The gods in the pantheon, such asNuWa, the Jade Emperor,Erlang Shen, andSanshengmu, are real deities in Chinese mythology and folklore.- TheWudangMountain, on which Sinegard Academy is built, is a real mountain in China, home to a famous complex of Taoist temples and a martial arts system that is the southern counterpart to the more internationally knownShaolin. For all their martial arts training, it makes sense that the fictional Sinegard is located there.I can keep going but you get the idea. The author doesn't spend too much time on worldbuilding and as much as there is, almost all of it is a direct depiction of China. Which is fine -- I won't sing the praises of the book's originality or creativity, but I would've been OK with treating it as alternate history -- except there are these little tweaks here and there that just make things really jarring.For example, why are the provinces named after the twelve zodiacs? Because this is the only thing that western readers are guaranteed to know about Chinese culture so it adds a cool Chinese aesthetic? No reasonable person, English or Chinese speaking, wouldactuallyname their provinces that way, because no one would want to live in the Rat Province or be titled the Dog Warlord. They sound just as ridiculous in Chinese as they do in English. (Well, honestly more ridiculous in Chinese becausedogis, unsurprisingly, the gender-neutral equivalent of the Englishbitch).And why are certain characters named after historical figures?Su DajiandJiang Ziyaare real people from 11th century BC.Nezha, on the other hand, is a folklore god, but unlike all the other gods in this book who appear in the pantheon, this one gets his name planted onto a mortal character.Surely you might say: they are just names! Then let me ask you this: how much would an American reader enjoy a high fantasy (secondary-world like this book is supposed to be, not paranormal and not intended to be a comedy) featuring a protagonist named George Washington (who bears no similarity to therealGeorge Washington), joined by his lieutenants Jesus and Mary, sailing across the Mississippi River on a battleship named Mayflower to fight a Civil War between two countries named The Black States and The White States? I wonder how many people might even find that offensive.What's worse, many other concepts kept their original names in this book but instead got their contents swapped out for something different. The aforementionedkeju, for example, was a real exam system in ancient China, but it was a series of tests taken as an assessment of the outcome of one's education to eventually qualify them for a job, not as a college entrance exam (so for the US, think medical boards instead of SAT). Not to mention that a person couldn't possibly pass it with mere mechanical memorization and that it was already abolished by the time of the Sino-Japanese War.The hexagrams used for fortune-telling in chapter 20, are real as well and play central roles in Taoism (you can read about themhere). But the symbols aren't drawn line by line, and there is no hexagram called The Net (nor did what Rin drew match the 26th one). I'm not expecting the author to do real fortune-telling, but say if you see something calledTarot de Marseilleshow up in a story, you'd expect them to be the correct deck of cards, not with all the numbers reordered, names replaced, and meanings changed, right?I know these are such tiny details that most people probably won't even care, but I think cultural representation matters, and swapping concepts like this is misleading. An unsuspecting reader would either expect these concepts to be real, and consequently take the half-truths as cool trivia facts, or expect them to be purely fictional, and consequently praise the author's creative imagination. I won't try to speculate which way is the author's intention, but I think anyone that draws so directly and heavily from real sources should at least acknowledge what they did to their readers.The UglyIf these are the only issues I have, I would've still been willing to say this book is \"good enough\". It was the last four chapters that undid everything.<Spoiler Alert: the following section contains vague spoilers for Part 3. I won't discuss any major events directly without spoiler tags, but if you prefer absolutely no hints of the plot, then please skip to the end of this review.>I've mentioned before that I appreciate Kuang's effort in bringing events from the Sino-Japanese War back to light. History is a big part of where we come from, and I think it's necessary for genre fiction to give it a nod from time to time. However, war crimes are heavy subjects and shouldn't be treated lightheartedly. Kuang didn't hold back punches in depicting all the horrifying cruelty and suffering inthe massacre of Golyn Niis, but for what purpose?Sure, it pushed Rin tojoin Altan in releasing the inmates at Chuluu Korikh, but that'sfridging. What's worse, it managed to motivate her for precisely one short chapter.After coming out of Chuluu Korikh, all Rin thinks about is her torture and Altan's sacrifice. It is the research lab that finally drives her to revenge, not the massacre.That's cheap even for fridging.And sure, it delivered a powerful scene to the reader, but I feel strongly against using historical tragedies for mere shock value.Rin's merciless revenge suffers from the same problem.She burns off the entire island of Mugen, killing every single innocent civilian in that country, and Kitay is the only one that thinks this is wrong.I read some reviews for The Dragon Republic and found that this wasn't resolved in the second book either:Rin never stops grieving for Altan, but no one gives a thought to the entire country that she wiped out.I understand that this series is supposed to be grimdark, but please, there are not one, not two, butthreegenocides in this one book, two of which are based onrealhistorical events. No significant consequences come out of any of them, and less than a handful of characters give a shit. Does no one else feel uncomfortable with this?<End Spoiler Alert>History aside, Rin's character also completely fell apart towards the end of the book. I get it, she went through a lot and has to make hard decisions, but none of her decisions make sense.She knows deep inside that Jiang is right about the inmates of Chuluu Korikh, but she takes Altan's side anyway because she'sin love. She wipes out Mugen, but the army that slaughtered her people still roams free in Nikan, and she calls that revenge?I love antiheroes and I don't hold anything against unlikable characters, but they need to be at leastunderstandable. Rin becomes so unreasonable and unrelatable that I felt like the book reverted to YA again, and a bad one this time: despite all the violence and gore, at the heart of it we still have a main character that's just as impulsive and immature as any recycled YA heroine.These, combined with the mediocre prose and the choking number of typos (which is not the author's fault, but I had trouble believing such a book to be professionally edited and published by Harper Voyager. I'm not usually a careful reader yet I easily spotted four or five glaring errors in my kindle copy), made The Poppy War such a huge letdown. I won't be continuing with the series, and I hope that one day our history and heritage will be something that we truly understand and value, not to be reduced to marketing gimmicks., error: I'm immensely disappointed.Before going into a LONG rant, let me first put out a disclaimer: I was born and raised in China, and this is the first time that I attempted a novel from a Chinese-American author. My background inevitably affected my reading experience -- up to the 80% mark I was going to give this book 3.5 stars, and thought that if I had only an average American's knowledge of Chinese culture, it could've been 5 -- but it was the last 20% that ruined the book for me, for entirely different reasons.That said, let's get started.The GoodThe Poppy War is fast-paced and moves through three distinct phases in the life of our main character Rin. Part 1 centers around her training at a military school, pushing her limits to survive the trials and win respect from her discriminating classmates. The stakes are high and some scenes get quite gritty, but there are also a lot of hilarious moments and the master-apprentice dynamics are heartwarming. This part has a strong YA vibe which is not my usual type, but I found it surprisingly enjoyable and could easily relate to Rin as a character.Part 2 takes on a big change in tone. Rin joins her friends and foes alike from school in a war against her country's island neighbor, meanwhile learning to wield her newly-found shaman power. The themes get considerably darker, with lots of battle scenes and graphical violence. This part was the highlight of the book for me: I loved all the battle tactics, the detailed planning and execution, the deception and manipulation. The general outline of events mimics that of the Sino-Japanese War, and a lot of parallels were drawn, but the strategies were quite original and I appreciate all the effort that the author put into it.Part 3 is where the book gets stamped as grimdark. After an astonishing turn of events, Rin and her comrades find themselves in dire situations where they have to make difficult decisions to save their country. I have major issues with thepurposeof certain scenes in this section, which I will explain further below, but I admire the fact that Kuang thought of including them in the first place. Too many atrocities were committed during WWII, and too many of them remain little known outside the countries where they occurred. As someone who shares heritage and history with Kuang, I think her intention is respectable and it's important to have such voices heard.Sadly, just like many other things in this book, her ideas are great, but the execution far from it.The BadThe worldbuilding is lazy to say the least, and very problematic in my opinion.First, let's get one thing straight: Nikan is not inspired by China. ItisChina. Simply changing some names into a different language doesn't make it a different country (Nikan means \"Chinese people\" in Manchurian). Here's why:- The texts Rin studies in chapter 1,Mengzi,Zhuangzi, andFuzi(Chinese spelling for Confucius), as well as the strategy text used at Sinegard,Sunzi(Chinese spelling for Sun Tzu), are real classics studied throughout history in China. Thekejuis also a real test, but more on that later.- The various types of foods, including the fancy dishes that appeared in chapter 8, are real dishes in China, although some of their names are modified (Eight Treasure Congee becomes Seven Treasure Soup, etc.). The trinkets sold by the street vendors in that chapter are also real toys for Chinese kids, and shadow play is a real hereditary art.- The gods in the pantheon, such asNuWa, the Jade Emperor,Erlang Shen, andSanshengmu, are real deities in Chinese mythology and folklore.- TheWudangMountain, on which Sinegard Academy is built, is a real mountain in China, home to a famous complex of Taoist temples and a martial arts system that is the southern counterpart to the more internationally knownShaolin. For all their martial arts training, it makes sense that the fictional Sinegard is located there.I can keep going but you get the idea. The author doesn't spend too much time on worldbuilding and as much as there is, almost all of it is a direct depiction of China. Which is fine -- I won't sing the praises of the book's originality or creativity, but I would've been OK with treating it as alternate history -- except there are these little tweaks here and there that just make things really jarring.For example, why are the provinces named after the twelve zodiacs? Because this is the only thing that western readers are guaranteed to know about Chinese culture so it adds a cool Chinese aesthetic? No reasonable person, English or Chinese speaking, wouldactuallyname their provinces that way, because no one would want to live in the Rat Province or be titled the Dog Warlord. They sound just as ridiculous in Chinese as they do in English. (Well, honestly more ridiculous in Chinese becausedogis, unsurprisingly, the gender-neutral equivalent of the Englishbitch).And why are certain characters named after historical figures?Su DajiandJiang Ziyaare real people from 11th century BC.Nezha, on the other hand, is a folklore god, but unlike all the other gods in this book who appear in the pantheon, this one gets his name planted onto a mortal character.Surely you might say: they are just names! Then let me ask you this: how much would an American reader enjoy a high fantasy (secondary-world like this book is supposed to be, not paranormal and not intended to be a comedy) featuring a protagonist named George Washington (who bears no similarity to therealGeorge Washington), joined by his lieutenants Jesus and Mary, sailing across the Mississippi River on a battleship named Mayflower to fight a Civil War between two countries named The Black States and The White States? I wonder how many people might even find that offensive.What's worse, many other concepts kept their original names in this book but instead got their contents swapped out for something different. The aforementionedkeju, for example, was a real exam system in ancient China, but it was a series of tests taken as an assessment of the outcome of one's education to eventually qualify them for a job, not as a college entrance exam (so for the US, think medical boards instead of SAT). Not to mention that a person couldn't possibly pass it with mere mechanical memorization and that it was already abolished by the time of the Sino-Japanese War.The hexagrams used for fortune-telling in chapter 20, are real as well and play central roles in Taoism (you can read about themhere). But the symbols aren't drawn line by line, and there is no hexagram called The Net (nor did what Rin drew match the 26th one). I'm not expecting the author to do real fortune-telling, but say if you see something calledTarot de Marseilleshow up in a story, you'd expect them to be the correct deck of cards, not with all the numbers reordered, names replaced, and meanings changed, right?I know these are such tiny details that most people probably won't even care, but I think cultural representation matters, and swapping concepts like this is misleading. An unsuspecting reader would either expect these concepts to be real, and consequently take the half-truths as cool trivia facts, or expect them to be purely fictional, and consequently praise the author's creative imagination. I won't try to speculate which way is the author's intention, but I think anyone that draws so directly and heavily from real sources should at least acknowledge what they did to their readers.The UglyIf these are the only issues I have, I would've still been willing to say this book is \"good enough\". It was the last four chapters that undid everything.<Spoiler Alert: the following section contains vague spoilers for Part 3. I won't discuss any major events directly without spoiler tags, but if you prefer absolutely no hints of the plot, then please skip to the end of this review.>I've mentioned before that I appreciate Kuang's effort in bringing events from the Sino-Japanese War back to light.

            "Translation failed for: What. The Hell. Happened.This book could have been a new favorite. It could have been a five star read. It could have been not torture to read. But alas.Let's back up a bit. I went into this book with pretty high expectations given the raving reviews I'd heard and to begin with I was not disappointed.Sure, the setup was a little (or a lot) cliché: Poor peasant girl with undeserved natural talent gets into prestigious military academy, beats out classmates with more knowledge, training and experience due to her just generally being *the shit*, discovers she has hidden powers and is bullied by students and teachers alike. Throw a single friend and an eccentric but likeable and secretly powerful teacher in the mix and well, you get the general plot to probably fifty million books in total.Now, that doesn't have to be a bad thing. As I said, I reaaaally enjoyed myself for the first half of the book. Rin is very devoted to her studies and her training. Due to her upbringing she is determined to prove she deserves to be at the Academy and her motivation and thirst for praise shines through in every single one of her actions. She throws herself into her studies like crazy, resorts to something close to self-harm to stay awake at times and often reminds herself of the fate that would be hers should she be kicked out of the Academy. This is her driving force for the first section of the book and it is written in a very believable and well constructed way. Her actions make sense. There is a feeling of greater purpose, of all of this training leading up to something. She is, as such, a well written and fully formed character with flaws and strengths.Unfortunately I eventually passed the 50% mark of the book, and this is where, well, for lack of a better term,everything goes to shit.While the first year of Rin's studies was described in a lot of detail, the author glosses over the next two years with little more than a few sentences and all of a sudden Rin has been at the Academy for a while. The war that has been looming with the Mugen has broken out. The capital is attacked, and all of a sudden every single parameter of the book changes. I am not exaggerating. From that point forward, it felt like I was reading an entirely different book. The setting changes, old characters are discarded (except for two of the more obnoxious ones) and a whole set of new characters and introduced that the author then wastes no time on actually developing. I get not wanting to start the process of character development over again in the middle of your novel. But well, that's why you generally don't switch out NINETY PERCENT OF YOUR ENTIRE CAST in one fell swoop.As a reader, you're thrown into this \"war\" that was barely set up and expected to care about it. You're also supposed to work heavily on your suspension of disbelief, because otherwise you'd be reading most of the book with eyebrows raised to the ceiling (my future wrinkles are on you Ms Kuang).Here's some questions that I have:1) Why was Sinegard, the capital of an actual EMPIRE and seat of the most prestigious military Academy in the entire country, so poorly defended that it took an invading army all of two seconds to tear down?2) Why do they spend so much time learning how to theorize the most outlandish tactics, but then all the tactics and strategies actually employed in the war are either extremely basic and/or plain stupid?3) Why does our main character, who was literally top of her class in the strategy course, throw all that brain matter away the second she enters the actual war and refuses to make a single smart decision from that point forward?4) Just in general, why is Nikara so poorly prepared for a war? All they do in the first half is talk and talk about how likely it is for Mugen to invade again. Well then, WHY DON'T YOU TRY PREPARING A LITTLE?I could go on and on. The worst moment for me was this little gem once Rin has joined the Cike (basically rag-tag team of outcasts with special powers aka The Avengers, is what I'm calling them now [And I swear I've been calling them that since before they started doing so themselves. Pinky promise.])I'm dubbing this the salpeter aka R.F. Kuang doesn't know basic chemistry incident. Mugen soldiers smuggle salpeter into the city pretending it's salt, alongside with sugar. The esteemed generals of the Milita only test the sugar and think to themselves, oh if there's nothing wrong with the sugar, the salt must be fine too. They maybe start distributing it to civilians... actually I don't know because maybe at this point the author realized this wasn't going anywhere meaningful and just had everything else happen off-stage. So somehow the salpeter gets into the city, and then even more mysteriously it - spontaneously self-combusts? - explodes and kills a bunch of people/takes down half the city, lots of carnage etc. etc. etc. Honestly I'm not that good with chemistry, but even I know that you need other materials to actually react with the salpeter to make it explode. Sure, it's a component in gunpowder - but that doesn't automatically MAKE IT gunpowder. A simple google search could have told anyone that. How she got away with this, the Phoenix only knows.Essentially, the second half of this book is closer to a trashfire than a meaningful story. It's as if it was written by an entirely different person. Rin suddenly doesn't have a personality anymore, aside from flip-flopping between panic to rage to insecurity to stubbornness to hatred to not really caring. From that point forward we hear nothing more of her motivations or what she thinks needs to happen aside from her going on about how she's so scared of war. Girl, you chose to enter a military Academy. What did you think was going to happen.Suddenly she is this empty husk of a person that's just there to relay what's left of the so-called story. And honestly, it's not much. There's fighting, sure, but who cares at this point? Most of it is written poorly, with a setting that's hard to discern or place in the greater context of a war, and the characters that have been set up to act a certain way entirely go off script and basically just fuck up. A lot.So you see, there are bad books. You pick them up and can tell pretty quickly what you've gotten yourself into, giving you a chance to decide whether you want to waste your time on them or not. And then there a books with a better-than-average premise, that have solid writing and characters, that actually make you CARE about what's happening, and then turn around and throw it all in your face. This is infinitely worse. I don't just dislike this book. I am bitter. I hold a grudge. And I will rant about it in more detail in a video coming next Friday. So hold on to your hats..., error: What.

            "Translation failed for: “Men were the only animals that slaughtered their own kind by the million, and turned the landscape into a waste of shell craters and barbed wire. Perhaps the human race would wipe itself out completely, and leave the world to the birds and trees… Perhaps that would be for the best…”-\tKen Follett,Fall of GiantsThis book is utter trash.Is that too harsh? Let me rephrase.This book is a steaming pile of garbage.Still a bit mean?It doesn’t matter. Ken Follett does not give a whit. His editor and publisher do not care. His accountant certainly is indifferent to this complaint.It’s not that Ken Follett is critic proof, because that implies that he achieves astronomical sales figures despite scathing reviews. That’s not the case. Rather, he achieves those astronomical sales with the apathetic approbation of critics usually quick to slash and burn.Ken Follett cannot be criticized. He is covered in Teflon, Kevlar, and Valyrian steel. Book reviewers understand this and have given up.Still, it needs to be said. This book is awful. And I don’t care that Ken Follett can’t hear me because his ear canals are plugged with diamonds.Moving on.Let us start with what Ken Follett is not. He is not a poet. He is not a short story writer. He does not craft literary fiction. He doesn’t even do thrillers anymore. Instead, Ken Follett writes dumbbell-sized works of historical fiction that manage to be simultaneously prodigiously researched and absolutely inauthentic.What is Ken Follett? Ken Follett is a wizard. He is an alchemist. He takes magic beans, plants them in fallow earth, and grows trees that shed money. He turns charcoal into diamonds, iron into gold; he sleeps in a room built from emeralds, and blows his nose in the finest silk. His ingredients are horrible characters, lack of psychological insight, lumbering plots, and striking coincidences. He mixes all these into 1,000 pages and creates a bestseller.Ken Follett has entered into a dark pact. I’m sure of it.To be fair,Fall of Giantsdoes not aspire to be great, National Book Award-contending literary fiction. Ken Follett does not want to be Jonathan Franzen; he doesn't even want to be John Jakes.There isn't a very high bar for this kind of book. Unfortunately, I can’t imagine any bar thatFall of Giantsactually hurdles. It’s not good fiction, it’s not good literary historical fiction (alaWar and Peace), and it’s not good historical fiction. Ken Follett makes Herman Wouk read like Proust, and Terry C. Johnson appear as Dostoyevsky.Fall of Giantsis the first in a proposed “Century Trilogy.” It is an ambitious undertaking, I’ll grant, and I’d be far more excited if a different author’s name was above the lame, innocuous title. Instead, there are at least 2,000 more pages of inanities to come. [Cue Ken Follett’s accountant planning a new addition to his house].The plot of the first installment is easily summarized: it’s World War I.Literally.The historical realities dictate everything that happens in this novel. Follett has taken the historical timeline and plugged it with so-called “characters” meant to give real-life events human-sized drama. You will find more drama, however, on any Wikipedia page.Not that Follett isn’t straining for drama. He certainly is. As the excerpt up top shows, he wants us to know that this big book isimportant.These turbulent years – somehow made exceedingly boring with Follett’s paralyzing touch – are viewed through the eyes of five interrelated families. It would be a stretch to call these characters archetypes. The words “cardboard cutout,” “tired clichés,” and “hopelessly derivative” are much more apt. Nothing happens or unfolds or is said that hasn’t happened, unfolded, or been said better in other books or movies. There is no wit, warmth, or ingenuity to be found. The only surprise is that Follett doesexactlywhat you expect him to,everysingle time.Take, for instance, Earl Fitzherbert, the English Lord of the Manor. Take a wild guess what he’s like. Conservative. Check. Insufferable. Check. Against suffrage. Check. Sleeping with his maid. Check.You might not believe it, but there’s also star-crossed lovers! Yes, I know, you didn’t think he’d pull the whole German man in love with a British woman bit (so daring!). But this is Follett. He does it. And if you also surmised that this German man will be suspiciously anti-imperial (no spiked helmet or pointy mustache here!), you are also on the money.Or what about the Williams family? They’re Welsh. They’re coalminers. As though – in Follett’s world – there is a difference. Also, you know they’re Welsh because the son, Billy, calls his dad “Da.” I stand in awe of the research it must have taken to uncover that nugget of detail.The use of “Da” and “Dai” is the extent of the Welsh idioms employed by the Williams family. It is the extent of the use of any idioms, really. Every character, whether English or Welsh or Russian or American or German speaks in the exact same way:unconvincingly. That is, they converse in robotic monotones meant to deliver historical exposition to keep us moving down the timeline toward the sequel. There is never a moment when two characters share original thoughts, insights, or profundities. I found no evidence, on the basis of the many interactions and conversations that occur, that anyone in this novel is a human being.Take, for instance, an exchange between Gus and Rosa. Gus works for President Wilson. He won’t let you forget about that, because it’s all he talks about. He also has a big head. Rosa has one eye. That is the extent of their characterizations:“I’m sorry,” [Rosa] said. “For you, for me, for the world.” She paused, then said: “What will you do?”“I’d like to join a Washington law firm specializing in international law. I’ve got some relevant experience, after all.”“I should think they’ll be lining up to offer you a job. And perhaps some future president will want your help.”He smiled. Sometimes she had an unrealistically high opinion of him. “And what about you?”“I love what I’m doing. I hope I can carry on covering the White House.”“Would you like to have children?”“Yes!”“So would I…I just hope Wilson is wrong about them…He says they will have to fight another world war.”“God forbid,” Rosa said fervently.God forbid, indeed. SPOILER ALERT. Gus and Rosa’s big-headed one-eyed children will have to fight another “world war.” If there’s a more awkward and clumsy way to set up the next book, I frankly really, really, really want to read it. For humor’s sake.Everything about Follett’s recreated world seems fake. It’s like a studio back-lot for a western movie: everything is a façade, with no actual dimensions. Every location, from England to Germany to Russia to the United States feels exactly the same.Follett’s research is a facile gilding. InPillars of the EarthandWorld Without End, Follett demonstrated his inability to create memorable personages or write convincing dialogue. Yet he also did a marvelous job cramming period-specific detail into the story. I still shudder to think about medieval bread, thanks to Follett’s meticulous recounting of how it was made. Nothing like that level of detail is present here. Instead, famous events are often passed off in the form of exposition. Towards the end of the novel, there is a nice little scene showing rampant inflation in postwar Germany. This small, intimate, anecdotal moment, shows Follett at his best, working his research into his larger story. Mostly, though, things like Gallieni’s “Taxis of the Marne” and the rise of Lenin and Trotsky come through in clunky dialogues.Historical fiction gives you the chance to breathe new life into actual people. Follett decides to ignore this opportunity completely. Despite walk-on roles by dozens of famous people, none of them is given even the hint of a spark. I'm not asking for something along the lines of Tolstoy's creative realization of Napoleon. But you have to do more than simply mention Sir Edward Grey's name and expect me to swoon at the verisimilitude.One of the odder things I’ve noticed about Follett is his inability to write a big set piece. His earlier work (Eye of the Needle,Night Over Water) showed him to be a precise plotter of containable dramas. Since he’s expanded his tableaus, however, he has lost his sure grip. I compare it to a movie director like Kevin Smith (director of small budget, dialogue-centric films) directing a big action movie. Follett just can’t do it. His battle scenes are silly and empty and fake. His big Russian Revolution moments are a confusing mess.And don’t even get me started on the bad sex scenes. There’s only one! I used to be able to count on Follett to prepare three or four euphemism-free adult encounters that would leave me searching for a bottle of wine and a pack of cigs. Not here. As Follett has reached his widest audiences yet, he seems to have toned down his erotic impulses. All we get is a handjob during an opera. That’s a shame.Perhaps the only interesting thing about this novel is its unusual political undercurrents. Generally, I think most people still hew to the Germans-were-the-aggressors-and-the-Allies-were-the-heroes line of World War I. (That casting is one of the consequences for Germany's actions in World War II). Follett takes a different tact, lingering on Great Britain's questionable decision to enter the war. His recollections of Unions and workers’ revolutions is also generally favorable, though I doubt the masses realize they are reading their fake-history with a leftist slant. (This is not a political hot-take. The slant isn’t bothersome, it’s just interesting. Rather, it would have been interesting in a more lively, well-written, coherent novel).This has been a rather negative review, so I will say two nice things:First, I appreciate that Follett always tries to find actual roles for his women. They are just as poorly-realized and one-dimensional (half-dimensional?) as everyone else, but they’re never window dressing.Second, Follett’s books go down easy. I think they are horrible in every objective, measurable way. Despite this, they are also fun to read. To me, the horribleness is even a bit endearing. Heck, another extremely graphic sex scene or two, and this might’ve earned another star.And there’s no way I’m missing the sequel.(EDIT: It has been many years, dear reader, and time has flowed on down the river. It now occurs to me that there is every possibility that I am missing the sequel. Life is just too short to read huge novels due solely to their unintentional hilarity)., error: “Men were the only animals that slaughtered their own kind by the million, and turned the landscape into a waste of shell craters and barbed wire. Perhaps the human race would wipe itself out completely, and leave the world to the birds and trees… Perhaps that would be for the best…”-\tKen Follett,Fall of GiantsThis book is utter trash.Is that too harsh? Let me rephrase.This book is a steaming pile of garbage.Still a bit mean?It doesn’t matter. Ken Follett does not give a whit. His editor and publisher do not care. His accountant certainly is indifferent to this complaint.It’s not that Ken Follett is critic proof, because that implies that he achieves astronomical sales figures despite scathing reviews. That’s not the case. Rather, he achieves those astronomical sales with the apathetic approbation of critics usually quick to slash and burn.Ken Follett cannot be criticized. He is covered in Teflon, Kevlar, and Valyrian steel. Book reviewers understand this and have given up.Still, it needs to be said. This book is awful. And I don’t care that Ken Follett can’t hear me because his ear canals are plugged with diamonds.Moving on.Let us start with what Ken Follett is not. He is not a poet. He is not a short story writer. He does not craft literary fiction. He doesn’t even do thrillers anymore. Instead, Ken Follett writes dumbbell-sized works of historical fiction that manage to be simultaneously prodigiously researched and absolutely inauthentic.What is Ken Follett? Ken Follett is a wizard. He is an alchemist. He takes magic beans, plants them in fallow earth, and grows trees that shed money. He turns charcoal into diamonds, iron into gold; he sleeps in a room built from emeralds, and blows his nose in the finest silk. His ingredients are horrible characters, lack of psychological insight, lumbering plots, and striking coincidences. He mixes all these into 1,000 pages and creates a bestseller.Ken Follett has entered into a dark pact. I’m sure of it.To be fair,Fall of Giantsdoes not aspire to be great, National Book Award-contending literary fiction. Ken Follett does not want to be Jonathan Franzen; he doesn't even want to be John Jakes.There isn't a very high bar for this kind of book. Unfortunately, I can’t imagine any bar thatFall of Giantsactually hurdles. It’s not good fiction, it’s not good literary historical fiction (alaWar and Peace), and it’s not good historical fiction. Ken Follett makes Herman Wouk read like Proust, and Terry C. Johnson appear as Dostoyevsky.Fall of Giantsis the first in a proposed “Century Trilogy.” It is an ambitious undertaking, I’ll grant, and I’d be far more excited if a different author’s name was above the lame, innocuous title. Instead, there are at least 2,000 more pages of inanities to come. [Cue Ken Follett’s accountant planning a new addition to his house].The plot of the first installment is easily summarized: it’s World War I.Literally.The historical realities dictate everything that happens in this novel. Follett has taken the historical timeline and plugged it with so-called “characters” meant to give real-life events human-sized drama. You will find more drama, however, on any Wikipedia page.Not that Follett isn’t straining for drama. He certainly is. As the excerpt up top shows, he wants us to know that this big book isimportant.These turbulent years – somehow made exceedingly boring with Follett’s paralyzing touch – are viewed through the eyes of five interrelated families. It would be a stretch to call these characters archetypes. The words “cardboard cutout,” “tired clichés,” and “hopelessly derivative” are much more apt. Nothing happens or unfolds or is said that hasn’t happened, unfolded, or been said better in other books or movies. There is no wit, warmth, or ingenuity to be found. The only surprise is that Follett doesexactlywhat you expect him to,everysingle time.Take, for instance, Earl Fitzherbert, the English Lord of the Manor. Take a wild guess what he’s like. Conservative. Check. Insufferable. Check. Against suffrage. Check. Sleeping with his maid. Check.You might not believe it, but there’s also star-crossed lovers! Yes, I know, you didn’t think he’d pull the whole German man in love with a British woman bit (so daring!). But this is Follett. He does it. And if you also surmised that this German man will be suspiciously anti-imperial (no spiked helmet or pointy mustache here!), you are also on the money.Or what about the Williams family? They’re Welsh. They’re coalminers. As though – in Follett’s world – there is a difference. Also, you know they’re Welsh because the son, Billy, calls his dad “Da.” I stand in awe of the research it must have taken to uncover that nugget of detail.The use of “Da” and “Dai” is the extent of the Welsh idioms employed by the Williams family. It is the extent of the use of any idioms, really. Every character, whether English or Welsh or Russian or American or German speaks in the exact same way:unconvincingly. That is, they converse in robotic monotones meant to deliver historical exposition to keep us moving down the timeline toward the sequel. There is never a moment when two characters share original thoughts, insights, or profundities. I found no evidence, on the basis of the many interactions and conversations that occur, that anyone in this novel is a human being.Take, for instance, an exchange between Gus and Rosa. Gus works for President Wilson. He won’t let you forget about that, because it’s all he talks about. He also has a big head. Rosa has one eye. That is the extent of their characterizations:“I’m sorry,” [Rosa] said. “For you, for me, for the world.” She paused, then said: “What will you do?”“I’d like to join a Washington law firm specializing in international law. I’ve got some relevant experience, after all.”“I should think they’ll be lining up to offer you a job. And perhaps some future president will want your help.”He smiled. Sometimes she had an unrealistically high opinion of him. “And what about you?”“I love what I’m doing. I hope I can carry on covering the White House.”“Would you like to have children?”“Yes!”“So would I…I just hope Wilson is wrong about them…He says they will have to fight another world war.”“God forbid,” Rosa said fervently.God forbid, indeed. SPOILER ALERT. Gus and Rosa’s big-headed one-eyed children will have to fight another “world war.” If there’s a more awkward and clumsy way to set up the next book, I frankly really, really, really want to read it. For humor’s sake.Everything about Follett’s recreated world seems fake. It’s like a studio back-lot for a western movie: everything is a façade, with no actual dimensions. Every location, from England to Germany to Russia to the United States feels exactly the same.Follett’s research is a facile gilding. InPillars of the EarthandWorld Without End, Follett demonstrated his inability to create memorable personages or write convincing dialogue. Yet he also did a marvelous job cramming period-specific detail into the story. I still shudder to think about medieval bread, thanks to Follett’s meticulous recounting of how it was made. Nothing like that level of detail is present here. Instead, famous events are often passed off in the form of exposition. Towards the end of the novel, there is a nice little scene showing rampant inflation in postwar Germany. This small, intimate, anecdotal moment, shows Follett at his best, working his research into his larger story. Mostly, though, things like Gallieni’s “Taxis of the Marne” and the rise of Lenin and Trotsky come through in clunky dialogues.Historical fiction gives you the chance to breathe new life into actual people.

Her attempt to flee doesn't even last longer than a few hours. I admit it's one of the most immature actions I've ever seen from a YA character. Come on! Is she a five years old kid or something!?Bianca also fell in love with Lucas after meeting him and chatting with him for just once, and then she is obsessed about him, moaning and mooning over him when Lucas didn't talk to her. My reaction to that is \"Okay, girl. He isn't talking to you, Get .Over. It! Get .A. Life!\" I mean, the whole drama with Lucas makes Bianca look like a five years old instead of a teenager.I know. I'm 10 years older than the targeted audience of this book, still I'm damn sure a lot of teenage girls out there will also find Bianca's behaviors immature and silly.Then we follow Bianca through a series of school dramas, meeting her new roommate and making friends among students. We are also told that there was a group of 'Evernight type' gorgeous, rich students who look down at the ordinary kids. Bianca was torn between staying on the Evernight type's good side and making friends with those ordinary kids.

And it probably maims my enjoyment of reading a little.I think, if I read this book without knowing anything about it beforehand, I would have truly been surprised by the major plot twist because I could hardly see it coming, still after the surprise washed over, then I would have felt so utterly cheated.*major plot spoiler warning*So here is the major plot twist, in the middle of the book, we are informed that many students and all of the teachers in Evernight were in fact vampires, which included Bianca herself and her parents.Okay, that's when I'm truly unable to suppress my disbelief.The entire book is narrated by Bianca's first person viewpoint but at the first half of the book, the word 'vampire' is never in her thoughts and she never mentioned her parents were drinking blood at dinners. How come?I understand Miss Gray wants to give us a surprise, but it doesn't work when she used first person perspective to narrate her book! What kind of vampire/half-vampire goes through an entire day, a whole week and even months with no thoughts concerning her own true identity and her parents' vampiric behaviors ever crossing her mind? Did she have a filter in her brain to filtrate every thought about vampire? Instead I feel such plot device is stupid and I feel cheated.And after the secret is revealed, all of a sudden the words 'vampire' and 'blood' popped up from Bianca's thoughts all the time without any break, it only confirmed my suspicion that the absence of those words in Bianca's thoughts in the first-half of the book is a pure plot device, plain and simple.Here's a humble suggestion: if Miss Gray wants to hide the true identity of her main character, next time would she please write her book with a third person viewpoint.Plus we also get the 'vampires going to highschool for eternity' BS.It's reasoned that young-looking vampires can choose to go to Evernight Academy in order to learn how to deal with the modern time and pretend to be ordinary humans. I admit that it is a good idea to let vampires deal with the issue of adjusting to the modern society (Anne Rice had addressed this issue before) still I hate the idea of immortals going to freaking highschool in order to learn how to deal with the change of time.

            "Translation failed for: The term I've coined for books such as these is \"the illusion of erudition.\" We love the anecdotes, many a form of comfirmation bias---the author telling us what we want to hear (cha-ching)---and we feel oh so much wiser once the wheels of the plane touch down on the runway at our destination because of having read a book such as this on our flight.====================================The famous, or infamous concept of the 10,000 \"rule\" in this book is not real. In a 2012 paper in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the lead author of the original study about the practice time of elite violinists, K. Anders Ericsson, ascribed the phrase’s popularity to a chapter title in Outliers, which, Ericsson wrote, “misconstrued” the conclusions of the violin study. Ericsson himself never used the number 10,000 or the term \"rule.\" Gladwell made that up.Ericsson extended his study to sports. Author David Espstein reports on the results (next four paragraphs)....In fact, in absolutely every single study of sports expertise, there is a tremendous range of hours of practice logged by athletes who reach the same level, and very rarely do elite performers log 10,000 hours of sport-specific practice prior to reaching the top competitive plane, often competing in a number of other sports— and acquiring a range of other athletic skills— before zeroing in on one.Studies of athletes have tended to find that the top competitors require far less than 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to reach elite status. According to the scientific literature, the average sport-specific practice hours to reach the international levels in basketball, field hockey, and wrestling are closer to 2,000, 4,000, and 6,000, respectively.In a sample of Australian women competing in netball (sort of like basketball but without dribbling or backboards), arguably the best player in the world at the time, Vicki Wilson, had compiled only 600 hours of practice when she made the national team. A study of athletes on Australia’s senior national teams found that 28 percent of them started their sport at an average age of seventeen, having previously tried on average three other sports, and and debuted at the international level just four years later.Even in this age of hyperspecialization in sports, some rare individuals become world-class athletes, and even world champions, in sports from running to rowing with less than a year or two of training. As with studies of chess players, in all sports and skills, the only real rule is that there is a tremendous natural range.======The down side to the Gladwell \"rule\" is that you see many unhappy kids out there being ground through the requisite \"hours\" by parents hoping their children will get scholarships or maybe go pro. I've coached enough youth sports to know there needs to be some base talent to build on for a young person to excel. I've also seen many 12-year olds who were stars at that age, but who faded by age 16, no matter how many hours they put in. I've coached youth sports for years. I've seen this over and over.https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/op...===========At the gym one day, I ran into a varsity high school football coach, whose team had just won the California state championship.I asked him about \"the 10,000 rule.\"He said: \"it's ruined many kids' lives.\"70% of kids quit sports by age 13, many of them because “it’s not fun anymore.”==============More falsehood called out by The Sports Gene....\"In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell makes a point about height in basketball by comparing it to IQ. There is a threshold, he writes, above which more does not really matter. Above an IQ of 120—which already eliminates most of humanity—he argues, one is already smart enough to consider the most difficult intellectual problems, and more IQ does not translate into real-world success. In basketball, he adds, “it’s probably better to be six two than six one . . . But past a certain point, height stops mattering so much.”But the “threshold hypothesis” of IQ is not supported by the work of scientists who specialize in that field, nor is the threshold hypothesis of NBA height supported by player data.\"Does Gladwell do any real research or fact-checking? Apparently not. He can't be trusted. I guess he has some readers think they're geniuses if they have an IQ of 120.================It struck me that Gladwell is like a prosperity Gospel preacher who tells people what they want to hear. And uses anecdotes that supposedly prove his points.I saw a couple of minutes of the most famous such preacher in the U.S. right now, Joel Osteen, who holds forth in a retrofitted basketball stadium in Houston. He began with:\"God is faithful. That promotion you've been waiting for: it's just around the corner. That lifetime soulmate you've always been looking for is on the way to you right now. The bonus money you need to take a vacation: you'll get that check by Christmas.\"Then he'll use some story, usually from the Old Testament, to illustrate. And throw in a couple of contemporary anecdotes. \"I met a man.....\"What if these good things don't come true? The dark side is that you get blamed. Somehow you've incurred God's displeasure.So you got cut from the team? It must be because you only put in 9,500 hours of practice instead of 10,0000.======================The backstory on Gladwell...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...=========More parental insanity pushing kids to make parents proud....\"Backyards feature batting cages, pitching tunnels, fencing pistes, Olympic-size hockey rinks complete with floodlights and generators.

He’s had three concussions, multiple overuse injuries, multiple surgeries—and he’s playing soccer in college?

Ericsson himself never used the number 10,000 or the term \"rule.\" Gladwell made that up.Ericsson extended his study to sports. Author David Espstein reports on the results (next four paragraphs)....In fact, in absolutely every single study of sports expertise, there is a tremendous range of hours of practice logged by athletes who reach the same level, and very rarely do elite performers log 10,000 hours of sport-specific practice prior to reaching the top competitive plane, often competing in a number of other sports— and acquiring a range of other athletic skills— before zeroing in on one.Studies of athletes have tended to find that the top competitors require far less than 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to reach elite status. According to the scientific literature, the average sport-specific practice hours to reach the international levels in basketball, field hockey, and wrestling are closer to 2,000, 4,000, and 6,000, respectively.In a sample of Australian women competing in netball (sort of like basketball but without dribbling or backboards), arguably the best player in the world at the time, Vicki Wilson, had compiled only 600 hours of practice when she made the national team. A study of athletes on Australia’s senior national teams found that 28 percent of them started their sport at an average age of seventeen, having previously tried on average three other sports, and and debuted at the international level just four years later.Even in this age of hyperspecialization in sports, some rare individuals become world-class athletes, and even world champions, in sports from running to rowing with less than a year or two of training. As with studies of chess players, in all sports and skills, the only real rule is that there is a tremendous natural range.======The down side to the Gladwell \"rule\" is that you see many unhappy kids out there being ground through the requisite \"hours\" by parents hoping their children will get scholarships or maybe go pro. I've coached enough youth sports to know there needs to be some base talent to build on for a young person to excel. I've also seen many 12-year olds who were stars at that age, but who faded by age 16, no matter how many hours they put in. I've coached youth sports for years. I've seen this over and over.https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/op...===========At the gym one day, I ran into a varsity high school football coach, whose team had just won the California state championship.I asked him about \"the 10,000 rule.\"He said: \"it's ruined many kids' lives.\"70% of kids quit sports by age 13, many of them because “it’s not fun anymore.”==============More falsehood called out by The Sports Gene....\"In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell makes a point about height in basketball by comparing it to IQ. There is a threshold, he writes, above which more does not really matter. Above an IQ of 120—which already eliminates most of humanity—he argues, one is already smart enough to consider the most difficult intellectual problems, and more IQ does not translate into real-world success. In basketball, he adds, “it’s probably better to be six two than six one . . . But past a certain point, height stops mattering so much.”But the “threshold hypothesis” of IQ is not supported by the work of scientists who specialize in that field, nor is the threshold hypothesis of NBA height supported by player data.\"Does Gladwell do any real research or fact-checking? Apparently not. He can't be trusted. I guess he has some readers think they're geniuses if they have an IQ of 120.================It struck me that Gladwell is like a prosperity Gospel preacher who tells people what they want to hear. And uses anecdotes that supposedly prove his points.I saw a couple of minutes of the most famous such preacher in the U.S. right now, Joel Osteen, who holds forth in a retrofitted basketball stadium in Houston. He began with:\"God is faithful. That promotion you've been waiting for: it's just around the corner. That lifetime soulmate you've always been looking for is on the way to you right now. The bonus money you need to take a vacation: you'll get that check by Christmas.\"Then he'll use some story, usually from the Old Testament, to illustrate. And throw in a couple of contemporary anecdotes. \"I met a man.....\"What if these good things don't come true? The dark side is that you get blamed. Somehow you've incurred God's displeasure.So you got cut from the team? It must be because you only put in 9,500 hours of practice instead of 10,0000.======================The backstory on Gladwell...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...=========More parental insanity pushing kids to make parents proud....\"Backyards feature batting cages, pitching tunnels, fencing pistes, Olympic-size hockey rinks complete with floodlights and generators. Hotly debated zoning-board topics include building codes for at-home squash courts and storm-drainage plans to mitigate runoff from private ice rinks. Whereas the Hoop Dreamers of the Chicago projects pursued sports as a path out of poverty and hardship, the kids of Fairfield County aren’t gunning for the scholarship money. It’s more about status maintenance, by any means necessary.\"\"Katie Andersen, who runs an Orange County, California–based college-advising company called College Fit, says that among the moral dilemmas the families she works with face is whether to come clean with a college coach about their kids’ multiple concussions. “Parents will be sitting in my office debating whether it makes sense to tell, and I want to scream.” Instead, she tries to play nice: “I say, ‘Can we please step back and think about your child? He’s had three concussions, multiple overuse injuries, multiple surgeries—and he’s playing soccer in college? There’s not even a question of him not playing?’ ”I call this stolen childhoods. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

And a little later,An American Werewolf in London!HOW THIS NOVEL COULD HAVE BEEN GREATThroughout this long tale, the fictional BEE is haunted by the even more fictional Patrick Bateman. Just as, I guess, the real BEE is haunted by his own misogynistic horror of a novel. Here he is on page 181, not wanting to think aboutAmerican Psycho:I closed my eyes again. I did not want to go back to that book. It had been about my father (his rage, his obsession with status, his loneliness), whom I had transformed into a fictional serial killer… I had moved past the casual carnage that was so prevalent in the books I’d conceived in my twenties, past the severed heads and the soup made of blood and the woman [er, let’s skip that sentence]… Exploring that kind of violence had been “interesting” and “exciting” and it was all “metaphorical” anyway – at least to me at that moment of my life, when I was young and pissed off… I was “transgressive” and the book was really about “style”When (inLunar Park) it seems that some crazy guy is pretending to be Patrick Bateman and copying each murder fromAmerican Psycho, BEE comments:This was the moment that detractors of the book had warned me about : if anything happens to anyone as a result of the publication of this novel, Bret Easton Ellis was to blame… and that’s why the National Organisation of Women had boycotted the book… I thought the idea was laughable – that there was no one as insane or vicious as this fictional character out there in the real world. Besides, Patrick Bateman was a notoriously unreliable narrator, and if you actually read the book you could come away doubting that these crimes ever occurred. There were large hints that they existed only in Bateman’s mind. The murders and torture were in fact fantasies fueled by his rage and fury about how life in America was structured and how this had trapped him. The fantasies were an escape. This was the book’s thesis. It was about manners and mores, not about cutting up women. How could anyone who read the book not see this?I appreciated that this all sounds like a desperate attempt by BEE to convince himself that he had not written a horrible misogynistic novel. (And is the explanation adopted by AP's many fans). Now – ifLunar Parkhad continued to probe this clearly-still-open wound within BEE, and maybe ask why, in describing BEE’s father’s rage, or Patrick Bateman’s fury at how life in America was structured, it had to be demonstrated through the torture and dismemberment of women, and not by some other means (say, planting bombs in subways – there are many ways to express a general rage), then we would have got something fascinating. But it was not to BEE. Instead, a lot of supernatural malarkey which – once again – is all about BEE’s relationship with his father and (fictional) son. In other words, it’s all about him.

It was dry and strange and a bit too technical for a piece of fiction, but I found the inner life of a large fancy hotel fascinating (and still enjoyed it on the reread).

We are treated to the instant adoration of the (former) Count by everyone who crosses the sophisticated man’s path, and even Party officials are not immune to his charisma.“Today, the dining room was nearly empty and the Count was being served by someone who appeared not only new to the Piazza, but new to the art of waiting. Tall and thin, with a narrow head and superior demeanor, he looked rather like a bishop that had been plucked from a chessboard.

Then just when the hero has a moment of respite from his daily affairs, Death pays him a visit.This is all well and good, allowed the Count. But what is rarely related is the fact that Life is every bit as devious as Death. It too can wear a hooded coat. It too can slip into town, lurk in an alley, or wait in the back of a tavern.”Then, of course, Towles shows that Life can intrude even on the gilded Paradise. Except for, of course, despite what I expected, life still cannot really breach this bubble of finer things in life into which Towles protectively wraps his character.The shallow, comfortable and surreally fancy existence is barely perturbed by anything.“Even men in the most trying of circumstances—like those lost at sea or confined to prison—will find the means to carefully account the passing of a year. Despite the fact that all the splendid modulations of the seasons and those colorful festivities that recur in the course of normal life have been replaced by a tyranny of indistinguishable days, the men in such situations will carve their 365 notches into a piece of wood or scratch them into the walls of their cell.”Compare your life to that in prison all you want, you are still rolling in luxury.

            "Translation failed for: Dystopian novels are more relevant than ever, but unfortunately I found Brave New World to be outdated and disorganized with no compelling characters and a haphazard storyline. OprahDaily.com states that the best dystopia novels offer both escapism and \"a resistance blueprint for when things go sideways.\" For me personally, Brave New World didn't provide either escape or guidance.I'm seeking a fresh vision. I'd appreciate your input. What's your favorite book about the world gone wrong?This is a continuation of a series on banned books. Unfortunately circumstances have become even more dire. White supremacists are no longer just seeking to ban books. Now they want to defund and close libraries. For example, the state house in Missouri recently voted to defund all the publicly funded libraries in Missouri. BOOK LOVERS NEED TO BE UNITED AND OUTSPOKEN IN OUR SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.In an effort to educate myself, I wanted to read some banned book classics. When it comes to banned books, the only book more classic than Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, but I've already read that book. I read Tropic of Cancer when I was a junior in high school. I can still remember two scenes from Miller's book. One pleasant memory involving a man being lead up a staircase by a woman. One unpleasant memory involving a man in desperate need of a chamber pot. I've been trying to purge my brain of the latter memory for 58 years, but if that memory is the price I have to pay for the former memory, so be it.I know many people like/love Brave New World (BNW), but I'm not one. I can't give BNW a blanket recommendation, but I can recommend it for several groups of readers. For example, librarians and high school teachers. Also, anyone interested in literary history or fans of the dystopia genre. Classic books like Brave New World give us a shared terminology that assists us in public discourse, so I also recommend BNW to anyone engaged in that public discourse.In order to give this book a numerical rating, I divided it up into three sections: (1) the Foreword and two Prefaces, (2) the BNW novel itself, and (3) Huxley's Brave New World Revisited discourse defending his novel. I give 1 a 3, 2 a 1, and 3 a 2. Averaging out to an overall 2 rating.Aldous Huxley and Christopher Hitchens make two main arguments in defense of BNW. First, the novel takes place 6 or 7 centuries after the birth of Henry Ford, and since Ford was born in 1863, we can't yet conclude that BNW hasn't accurately predicted the future. (Essentially, they're arguing that they're right, because we can't yet prove they're wrong.) Secondly, they argue that Huxley did a better job of prediction than George Orwell. I'm extremely skeptical about that assertion. Wouldn't the worlds that Hitler and Satlin tried to create have ended up similar to the world portrayed in 1984? What about the worlds Napoleon and Alexander the Great tried to create? Additionally, does BNW give us insight into totalitarian tendencies or guidance on how to combat them? I certainly didn't find any.And then there's religion. I've gotten the impression that neither Huxley nor Orwell anticipated a totalitarian regime like what exists in modern-day Iran.Before I discuss the BNW novel any further, let me tell you about my 11th grade English teacher.(The story I'm about to tell happened before I read Henry Miller's book, and since I've now mentioned that book again, please allow me to make a brief additional digression. I just listened to a sample from the audiobook of Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and it didn't sound like a book I'd enjoy today. Also, it didn't sound like something I would now recommend. If I reread it today, I'd probably give it a bad review. But even so, I would never ever tell my younger self not to read it. I mean, if I hadn't read Tropic of Cancer, I wouldn't have that memory of a man following a woman up a staircase. On the other hand, I also wouldn't have that memory of the man in desperate need of a chamber pot. Life is a tradeoff, I guess. [Would it be an additional digression to mention that Max Shulman taught me the art of digression? That also happened when I was in 11th grade. I guess that should be another story on another day. Even Max Shulman knew you had to get back to the main story before you forget what the heck it was. What was it? Oh yeah, my 11th grade English teacher. (Oh, I also met my future wife when I was in the 11th grade. Man, what a year that was! The '64/'65 school year. It was so much better than the fall of '63.) I've digressed too much, I fear.])Let me get back to the story about my 11th grade English teacher. It was the first day of English class on the first day of school in September of 1964. My English teacher wrote his name on the blackboard, and he explained what we'd be doing that year in English class. He said he would teach us to write clearly and concisely. He said there was nothing worse than wasting the reader's time.I have a vivid memory of what happened next. He explained his grading system. An A grade meant we clearly understood the assignment, and our execution was perfect. B and C grades meant we understood the assignment, but our execution was imperfect. D and F grades were reserved for students who clearly had problems but who had the competence and good character to succeed in the future if they received appropriate guidance. He told us that if we got a D or F, we should talk to him and allow him to guide us in our future class related endeavors. Finally, he told us that if we got a C-minus, it meant that he felt our effort and character were crap. He didn't want to talk with C-minus students because it would be a waste of his time. At that point, all the future C-minus students loudly expressed their displeasure. They believed that crappy effort and bad character deserved a B-minus.Consider the 2 rating I'm giving Brave New World to be equivalent to a C-minus. Let me explain. In his two Prefaces and in Brave New World Revisited, Huxley seems to be arguing that Brave New World deserves a B-minus. If Huxley had graciously admitted the novel's flaws, and if Brave New World Revisited had been a serious attempt to correct those flaws, l wouldn't be questioning Huxley's character. If Huxley had done those two things, I wouldn't now be suggesting that Brave New World is worthy of a C-minus.Brave New World had a very promising beginning. In his first preface, Huxley starts out stating that rather than fretting about past mistakes, we should endeavor to do better in the future. I was impressed with that since it was the same advice my junior varsity football coach had attempted to give me when I was a freshman in high school. He. shouted at me, \"Get it right next time, dammit, or you'll be sitting on the bench with the other idiots.\"In Brave New World, there's a character called Savage. I knew a guy with the last name of Savage. Let's call him Savage Savage for short. SS couldn't have had a better name. I first met SS at First Church Sunday School, and later on, we went to the same high school. We must've been about four when we first met. It was a Sunday School class for preschool kids. Us little kids basically played while our parents attended the church ceremony.The boys played with trucks and blocks, and the girls played with dolls and toy beds. There were lots of little cars and trucks, but only one good-sized truck. On my first day, no one told me that only SS was allowed to play with the big truck.Upon arrival at Sunday School, I immediately noticed no one was playing with the big blocks, so I immediately built a big bridge for the big truck to drive over. When I finished the bridge, I naturally suggested to SS that he drive the truck over the bridge. SS said the truck couldn't drive over the bridge. I assured SS that it could, and I picked up the truck to show SS how it could be done. SS grabbed the truck back and clobbered me on the top of the head with it. I bled for hours.For reasons I won't mention, I never forget nor forgave SS for clobbering me on the head with a toy truck. Brave New World has taught me I was wrong. I should have forgiven SS, and now I should atone for my sins.I have prior experience with atonement and atonement ceremonies. In my experience, atonement ceremonies seemed somewhat like an orgy, but since I've never been to an orgy I can't be certain.One year at church camp during our talent show, one of the ministers interrupted the festivities. He held up a girl's nightgown and claimed that someone had ripped it to shreds. (He never mentioned who or why.) Then a girl I'd never seen before stepped forward. She was all in tears. She claimed someone had ripped up her nightgown. It wasn't long before everyone was in tears, and we were all asking for Jesus to come into our lives. (That was rather strange because we were all regular church goers, and one would assume Jesus was already in our lives.)That minister apparently didn't realize that many of us kids went to church camp every summer, so when he attempted the same nasty deception the next year with the very same torn nightgown and co-conspirator. Us kids verbally tore him to shreds.Some months later, this minister asked me for my forgiveness, and I told him it wasn't my job. It's easy to get confused about what your job is and what it isn't. On that day, I didn't have any confusion. It's now my job to finish this review.Huxley should have had an English teacher like I did in 11th grade to teach him to write clearly and concisely so he wouldn't waste the readers' time. It took him like forever to get his book started, and then he ended the story suddenly.I didn't complain about the book ending, even though Brave New World left me curious about the Orgy-porgy song mentioned at the end of the book. I did a web search, but the only Orgy Porgy song I could find was the one sung by Fatso Jetson. I listened to Fatso Jetson's version of Orgy Porgy, and I honestly have to admit I did feel something moving inside me. I liked Fatso Jetson's Orgy Porgy song. It got right to the point, and there was absolutely no confusion regarding what he was singing about. Jetson's song reminded me of that scene in Tropic of Cancer where a man follows a woman up a staircase.15 April 2023I realize that a two-star rating for Brave New World is sacrilege. That's why I'll be posting my full review tomorrow as part of an atonement ceremony. Your official invitation follows.Accordion players, pantomime artists, and genre lovers of all sorts are invited to my atonement ceremony on Sunday, 16 April 2023. Bring your own munchies and drinks. Chef Berengaria will provide food for thought. I'll be paying homage to Henry Miller and Max Shulman while dancing on the point of a pen.

Us little kids basically played while our parents attended the church ceremony.The boys played with trucks and blocks, and the girls played with dolls and toy beds. There were lots of little cars and trucks, but only one good-sized truck. On my first day, no one told me that only SS was allowed to play with the big truck.Upon arrival at Sunday School, I immediately noticed no one was playing with the big blocks, so I immediately built a big bridge for the big truck to drive over. When I finished the bridge, I naturally suggested to SS that he drive the truck over the bridge. SS said the truck couldn't drive over the bridge. I assured SS that it could, and I picked up the truck to show SS how it could be done. SS grabbed the truck back and clobbered me on the top of the head with it. I bled for hours.For reasons I won't mention, I never forget nor forgave SS for clobbering me on the head with a toy truck. Brave New World has taught me I was wrong. I should have forgiven SS, and now I should atone for my sins.I have prior experience with atonement and atonement ceremonies. In my experience, atonement ceremonies seemed somewhat like an orgy, but since I've never been to an orgy I can't be certain.One year at church camp during our talent show, one of the ministers interrupted the festivities. He held up a girl's nightgown and claimed that someone had ripped it to shreds. (He never mentioned who or why.) Then a girl I'd never seen before stepped forward. She was all in tears. She claimed someone had ripped up her nightgown. It wasn't long before everyone was in tears, and we were all asking for Jesus to come into our lives. (That was rather strange because we were all regular church goers, and one would assume Jesus was already in our lives.)That minister apparently didn't realize that many of us kids went to church camp every summer, so when he attempted the same nasty deception the next year with the very same torn nightgown and co-conspirator. Us kids verbally tore him to shreds.Some months later, this minister asked me for my forgiveness, and I told him it wasn't my job. It's easy to get confused about what your job is and what it isn't. On that day, I didn't have any confusion. It's now my job to finish this review.Huxley should have had an English teacher like I did in 11th grade to teach him to write clearly and concisely so he wouldn't waste the readers' time. It took him like forever to get his book started, and then he ended the story suddenly.I didn't complain about the book ending, even though Brave New World left me curious about the Orgy-porgy song mentioned at the end of the book. I did a web search, but the only Orgy Porgy song I could find was the one sung by Fatso Jetson. I listened to Fatso Jetson's version of Orgy Porgy, and I honestly have to admit I did feel something moving inside me. I liked Fatso Jetson's Orgy Porgy song. It got right to the point, and there was absolutely no confusion regarding what he was singing about. Jetson's song reminded me of that scene in Tropic of Cancer where a man follows a woman up a staircase.15 April 2023I realize that a two-star rating for Brave New World is sacrilege. That's why I'll be posting my full review tomorrow as part of an atonement ceremony. Your official invitation follows.Accordion players, pantomime artists, and genre lovers of all sorts are invited to my atonement ceremony on Sunday, 16 April 2023. Bring your own munchies and drinks. Chef Berengaria will provide food for thought. I'll be paying homage to Henry Miller and Max Shulman while dancing on the point of a pen.

            "Translation failed for: Alright. I read this wrong. It's all on me.I've got my Cone of Shame and am headed to the Shame Corner right now.It was nice being out for awhile but we all knew I couldn't stay out for long.I'm not sure if something was lost in translation, if I'm just really not good at science, or if I am waaaaay too American, but whatever the case, I did not enjoy this.Well, Idid, but only through maybe the first half. Then it got tedious, then it got boring, then it got downright ridiculous, and then I stabbed my ears out so I wouldn't have to listen anymore.The story follows two timelines and characters that you know are going to intersect.It starts with (phonetically-spelled, based on the reader's terrible pronunciation): Astrophysicist Yeah Wen-Sia who sees her father killed by three fanatic teenage girls when he won't deny science during the Cultural Revolution. Then, her favorite and best teacher commits suicide, her mother, who is terribly unstable, abandons her, and her sister has joined the Revolution and is a fanatic in her own right. Ye is angry and carries this anger with her to the woods where she is employed in deforestation at the base of Red Coast Station which is, essentially, a military base with a huge satellite that sits up on top of a hill and is fairly inaccessible and anyone who even strolls near will be shot.The second storyline is that of (phonetically-spelled, based on the reader's terrible pronunciation) Wong Meow, owner of zero personality. He's a nanotech/biology somesuch researcher scientist in the current day who is alarmed when the nation's top physicists and other brainy sorts start committing suicide. I don't really remember, if I ever actually knew, how he falls into all of this, but he gets involved, via a tough-as-nails cop named Dah Shee, with a sort of investigation into the larger scope of the problem that is causing these scientists to kill themselves.Through a series of not-noticeable events, Wang finds out about an online game called Three Body and he decides to play. It's a weird game that follows civilizations as they grow and then collapse on a world where there are three suns and these suns pose a real-life (like, real to our lives) mathematical quandary called the Three Body Problem in which three things whiz around a stationary object (I think. I may be making the stationary object up) but each has a different kind of orbit and they're sort of random and you must find the pattern of their zoomings to predict when they'll be close to each other or the object and when they'll be farthest apart, etc. How can you track the movement of these three bodies to predict what they'll do next, is the question. At any rate, if you solve the Three Body Problem in the game, you win. Only really smart people can play this game, obviously. People whose brains think in spatial relationships and numbers at all hours of the day, I assume.There are more characters but these are the main two and their lives intersect and things happen.Before I spew forth my list of what I misunderstood, I'm going to share what I thought I was going to read.The Direction In Which I Thought This Book Would Go:Someone, namely Yeah Wen-Sia, bent on revenge against humanity, reached out to SPAAAACE during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Aliens got the message and replied. Some aliens want to conquer us because of course but others send us the Three Body game as an introduction to their history and to build sympathy so that we offer them solace in our system or, at the very least, help them with their three body problem. The Tri-Solarans race to see who gets here first and one of the groups manages to send two protons to Earth. But are they protons or are they actually ships/bacteria/something sinister from aliens? What do they do? Why were they sent?Chaos ensues as the Good Aliens try to help those of us who want to save Earth fend off the Bad Aliens - all the same race, just different factions - and their human allies who think people should be eradicated because they destroy everything. The Bad Aliens don't want us to spread throughout the galaxies because, again, we destroy everything so they must destroy us first. The Good Aliens want to colonize us and live here because their own homeworld is in peril due to the unpredictability of their crazyass suns. We lose no matter what but is it better to be enslaved or to be eliminated?Yeah leads one side while Wong leads the other and there's an epic rap battle at the end! WHO WON! WHO'S NEXT?What Actually Happened and Why I Lost Interest:Ye reached out, bent on revenge, then made up an entire alien race based on one reply she received eight years after her accidental Message to the Universe was sent. Someone created a game based on Ye’s made-up alien race and scientist-types played it to solve a math problem but then went mad (it may have been the protons) and killed themselves. Maybe the Adventists, one of three cult factions that formed in regard to First Contact, were behind the game because they were actually the only ones receiving information from the aliens and, presumably, giving info back. The game was won but then the nature of the game changed and players found out there had been multiple inhabited worlds and now there was only one because the suns kept bumping into the worlds and destroying them and the one that was still left was doomed and the TriSolarans (those are the people from the game and also the aliens who have been talking to China) want to move here and also want to kill us and the new End Game is to get TriSolarans to invent space travel. Then there was a big philosophical political thinkpiece over on the alien world that we got to hear and it was slapstickedly represented and then there was talking and something else happened I couldn’t quite grasp, all of it built on a foundation of theoretical physics. Then we were back on Earth and a battle was about to begin. I think.And here are the things I just did not understand at all:1) The computer game. I actually loved it. It was really intriguing. Wong had to wear a haptic suit (like inReady Player One) in the game, though I don't actually know why except to feel the extreme temperatures but ok, that's fine. There are extreme temperature fluctuations in this game and that's probably important plus it's fun to say \"haptic suit.\" But here's the thing. The game is about the fall of civilization when a chaotic event occurs and wipes everything out and the further civilization can build, the closer it can get to solving the Three Body Problem and winning the game. I thought it was a multi-player game and it seems there is some crossover because players in and out of game recognize Wang but it also seems everyone has to play their own version of the game. At first, I thought everyone was a player and wondered what they did while they were dehydrated - did they just log in and sit there, being dehydrated in a stack of other dehydrated people? (during chaos times, all but a skeleton crew dehydrates and gets stored in dehydration silos. That way, during stable times, everyone (and thing) can be rehydrated to work on civilization. Yay!) But then another player said she'd gone through 203 civilizations when Wong had only experienced 194, or something, and while everyone knew his in-game character, he knew no others, so...ok, confused. Just how does this online game work, people?2) How many people know there's been contact with other sentient life out in the universe? Apparently, a lot of people because there are cultish factions built around the idea of the Tri-Solarans: The Adventists who want humanity wiped out, the Redemptionists who want to help The Lord solve the Three Body Problem OR let the Tri-Solarans come live here peacefully just as long as everyone stays alive and unenslaved. Probably. And the Survivors. Those are all the lower-class, poor people who just want to keep living. The militaries and governments of some of Europe and of America (but not Canada or South America, apparently) all get together and talk about the upcoming war. The Chinese police force are aware of the incoming danger. And yet, supposedly, it's not widely known that intelligent life has responded to queries...What?3) Ok. Math. I suck at it, I admit, but help me out here. Ye sent her message and eight years later, she got a reply. However, The Listener got the original message and is the one who sent back the \"Don't reply, you dumbass\" message and then they get a reply, like, half an hour later. And suddenly, the two worlds are essentially emailing back and forth. Apparently. How'd that work?Related: The TriSolarans are on their way to Earth, right? They've sent two protons to ahead of them, kind of Trojan protons and I didn't understand what that was all about but whatever. They got two protons here, probably using their email service. It was probably sent as a pdf, or something. The point being, they got here fast because they could travel fast. However, the ship the TriSolarans are traveling to Earth in will take 450 years to get here because while it can drive 10 times the speed of light, it can't keep that up and has to do a lot of coasting. Yet people are all freaking out over this bunch of aliens who will be here in just under half a century. But then the Judgement Day ship - and I assume that's an alien ship? - shows up and is sliced to pieces at the Panama Canal. Where the hell did the Judgement Day ship come from?? What happened? Someone please explain this to me? I don't understand how time works! Actually, I think I must have missed an entire chapter in which the Judgement Day ship was explained because I have no idea what went on there.4) The sliced ship brings me to my next item of contention. How did humans know where the ship was going to show up? They had discussed different places to set up this crazy nanofilament trap (how did they set that up, by the way, without slicing up everything the filaments touched?) because they needed certain environmental factors to be met but none of those factors were where the ship may dock. So they set it up across the Panama Canal and voila! The ship appears. I don't even know where it came from. The sky? Was it an ocean liner? What was this ship and who was on it and how'd it get to the Panama Canal? EXPLAIN!5) So we get to meet the Tri-Solarans (I think. I mean, I suppose we could have been seeing mainly what was going on in Ye's head as she read the love letters that went back and forth from Earth to TriSolaria) and they're a little bit silly. They sounded like a Monty Python sketch about high-falutin' types who take themselves too seriously. Anyway, they decide they can't actually do any better living on Earth but they'll wipe us out anyway because we're going to become a disease later on so they may as well do the universe a favor. What kind of logic is that? They're on the brink of extinction and they decide we should go, too? But before they do that, they have to make us stop having science because if we don't, we'll be able to beat their asses by the time they get here. Interestingly enough, there is only one kind of science in the universe because what we can see, hear, smell...all the things we can sense are the only things that exist in the entirety of space and time so TriSolaran science and Earthling science are the same which is why they understand how far we've come and how far we'll get in another 450 years and so they must stop our science for their own safety. This is all based on information I assume the Adventists emailed to them over their years of loving correspondence? I...what?An aside: Thank goodness Mike Evans died pointing to the computers that housed the secret alien emails. Because why wouldn't you be toting those along with you to the Panama Canal, amirite?Ok, so, it's obvious this went WAY over my head. Way way way over. I'm probably too inculturated in Western SciFi to be able to appreciate what I listened to. And, by the way, what I listened to was crap because, yet again, the narrator is some white dude who doesn't speak Chinese. Also, he made the Chinese tough-as-nails cop's voice alternate between a NYC beat cop accent and a Texan accent. It was bizarre. I did not enjoy that at all.I've read several of the other five-star reviews here and I've yet to find any enlightenment on my misunderstandings. I'm just seeing a lot of people going nuts over how amazing this is and I can't understand, even from their glowing reviews, what they read that I didn't.This is the first in a trilogy. I feel like I should listen to them all just to find out if any of my questions are answered but I'm not really into self-torture so probably, I'll pass., error: Alright. I read this wrong.

            "Translation failed for: Video full series review (spoiler free)-https://youtu.be/V3TuI9iCvoUUpdate 2/11/17- After reading the second book and having more time to sit on it, I'm lowering my rating of this one from 3 stars to 2.5 stars. The sequel was fine, but this first book was a rough start and was a mostly negative experience for me.Original 2/6/17-I wrote some harsh things about this book on Twitter and in earlier reading updates about how it was offensive, so I want to address that. This book is a dystopia, which I didn't realize going in. In some respects, it is intentionally offensive. A terrible society is set up that you are supposed to hate and want to be overthrown.I never know what people consider to be spoilers so I'm hiding some of the following points. Open if you want to know more.Race-Race is something that was handled questionably. The society in this book is monoethnic. They are described as having darker, olive toned skin and dark hair and eyes. When the main character Amy is introduced with her pale skin, red hair, and green eyes, the other character Elder immediately sees her as more beautiful than anyone else. I felt that this reinforced white beauty standards. If the races had been changed, however, it may have also reinforced exoticism (though I'm not the right person to ask on that).\"She is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, but also the strangest. Her skin is pale, almost translucent white, and I don't think it's just from the ice. [...] How can this girl fit into the monoethnic no-differences-at-all world Eldest says provides perfect peace?\" - p57I think it was just an unfortunate situation that the book wrote itself into. The main point the book is trying to make is that our differences should be celebrated and there is a line in the last half about identity being tied to race, so by trying to erase race the leaders of this society were erasing what makes humanity so beautiful.\"He has no concept that a race is part of a person's identity - he just sees it as a difference, a difference that's better off eliminated.\" p306Ultimately, I can appreciate the point the book was making by showing race erasure as a flaw in the society, but I think it was done a bit clumsily.Mental Illness-Another part I didn't like was the handling of mental illness. There is a mental ward on the ship and every time it was mentioned, I was uncomfortable. Again, the way it was portrayed did have a reason in the end. You are supposed to dislike it. However, there were some truly awful stereotypes used in regards to mental illness that are not ok, and did not need to be included to make the point the book was trying to make. Every character in the mental ward is called a creative type. They are painters, writers, poets. This reinforces the stereotype that mental illness equals creativity, or vice versa. There was also a line that equated being organized with having OCD.\"The doctor starts straightening the pencils I dumped on his desk. He's seriously OCD.\" p109While other aspects of how mental illness were treated were challenged, these 2 things were not, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.Possessive relationship & male gaze-This is the part of the story I ended up hating the most. Sure, Elder is a product of his flawed society, but there is no way I am excusing his actions enough to ship this. The first time Elder sees Amy, she's naked and unconscious and he spends several lines describing her breasts and saying how he can't look away from them.\"My eyes devour her body, then drift back to her breasts. The ice is a little foggy there, teasing me, but I can see enough to know they're lush, and even if they're frozen, I imagine that if they were warmed up...\" (character's thoughts are cut off) p57Many times in the book they are interacting and he has internal thoughts of grabbing her or slamming her against walls to crush her lips with his.\"Amy bites her lip, and all I want to do is seize her, crush her against me, feel her lips with mine.\" p173His thoughts are very sexual and aggressive in tone. He isn't aggressive with her in action, but he is very jealous of other males talking to her, and acts generally possessive towards her. Because he is the only male on the ship her age, Amy just kind of goes with it. I cannot, will not, get behind this ship. She has no choice. (To be fair, Amy brings up this very point about choice at the start of book 2.)Sexual assault- I felt it was also worth mentioning that there is a scene of attempted rape in the book for anyone who needs a heads up. I can see how it serves to make a point about the society, but I hated reading it.In short, the society in this book is pretty offensive, but I can see now that it is intentionally that way in order to make its point. I think that if I had known this book was a dystopia rather than a space adventure, I probably would have realized earlier that of course the society would be awful and I wouldn't have reacted so negatively at first. Though, some of the things were just plain offensive without excuse. Basically what I'm saying is: it's bad, but not as bad as I initially thought.As for my enjoyment of the story, I thought a couple of the plot twists were super obvious, and I really didn't enjoy reading about this society (though as I've said, you aren't supposed to enjoy it). The characters both seemed very childish in the way they spoke, although I listened to the audiobook and that very well could have been due to the way the narrators read it (book 2 has different voice actors and has a totally different feel). By the end I did decide to pick up the next book, mainly just because I'm trying to read some of Beth Revis's work and this series is the most easily available one to me on OverDrive., error: Video full series review (spoiler free)-https://youtu.be/V3TuI9iCvoUUpdate 2/11/17- After reading the second book and having more time to sit on it, I'm lowering my rating of this one from 3 stars to 2.5 stars. The sequel was fine, but this first book was a rough start and was a mostly negative experience for me.Original 2/6/17-I wrote some harsh things about this book on Twitter and in earlier reading updates about how it was offensive, so I want to address that. This book is a dystopia, which I didn't realize going in. In some respects, it is intentionally offensive. A terrible society is set up that you are supposed to hate and want to be overthrown.I never know what people consider to be spoilers so I'm hiding some of the following points. Open if you want to know more.Race-Race is something that was handled questionably. The society in this book is monoethnic. They are described as having darker, olive toned skin and dark hair and eyes. When the main character Amy is introduced with her pale skin, red hair, and green eyes, the other character Elder immediately sees her as more beautiful than anyone else. I felt that this reinforced white beauty standards. If the races had been changed, however, it may have also reinforced exoticism (though I'm not the right person to ask on that).\"She is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, but also the strangest. Her skin is pale, almost translucent white, and I don't think it's just from the ice. [...] How can this girl fit into the monoethnic no-differences-at-all world Eldest says provides perfect peace?\" - p57I think it was just an unfortunate situation that the book wrote itself into. The main point the book is trying to make is that our differences should be celebrated and there is a line in the last half about identity being tied to race, so by trying to erase race the leaders of this society were erasing what makes humanity so beautiful.\"He has no concept that a race is part of a person's identity - he just sees it as a difference, a difference that's better off eliminated.\" p306Ultimately, I can appreciate the point the book was making by showing race erasure as a flaw in the society, but I think it was done a bit clumsily.Mental Illness-Another part I didn't like was the handling of mental illness. There is a mental ward on the ship and every time it was mentioned, I was uncomfortable. Again, the way it was portrayed did have a reason in the end. You are supposed to dislike it. However, there were some truly awful stereotypes used in regards to mental illness that are not ok, and did not need to be included to make the point the book was trying to make. Every character in the mental ward is called a creative type. They are painters, writers, poets. This reinforces the stereotype that mental illness equals creativity, or vice versa. There was also a line that equated being organized with having OCD.\"The doctor starts straightening the pencils I dumped on his desk. He's seriously OCD.\" p109While other aspects of how mental illness were treated were challenged, these 2 things were not, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.Possessive relationship & male gaze-This is the part of the story I ended up hating the most. Sure, Elder is a product of his flawed society, but there is no way I am excusing his actions enough to ship this. The first time Elder sees Amy, she's naked and unconscious and he spends several lines describing her breasts and saying how he can't look away from them.\"My eyes devour her body, then drift back to her breasts. The ice is a little foggy there, teasing me, but I can see enough to know they're lush, and even if they're frozen, I imagine that if they were warmed up...\" (character's thoughts are cut off) p57Many times in the book they are interacting and he has internal thoughts of grabbing her or slamming her against walls to crush her lips with his.\"Amy bites her lip, and all I want to do is seize her, crush her against me, feel her lips with mine.\" p173His thoughts are very sexual and aggressive in tone. He isn't aggressive with her in action, but he is very jealous of other males talking to her, and acts generally possessive towards her. Because he is the only male on the ship her age, Amy just kind of goes with it. I cannot, will not, get behind this ship. She has no choice. (To be fair, Amy brings up this very point about choice at the start of book 2.)Sexual assault- I felt it was also worth mentioning that there is a scene of attempted rape in the book for anyone who needs a heads up. I can see how it serves to make a point about the society, but I hated reading it.In short, the society in this book is pretty offensive, but I can see now that it is intentionally that way in order to make its point. I think that if I had known this book was a dystopia rather than a space adventure, I probably would have realized earlier that of course the society would be awful and I wouldn't have reacted so negatively at first. Though, some of the things were just plain offensive without excuse. Basically what I'm saying is: it's bad, but not as bad as I initially thought.As for my enjoyment of the story, I thought a couple of the plot twists were super obvious, and I really didn't enjoy reading about this society (though as I've said, you aren't supposed to enjoy it).

I had some difficulty with Elder's character but his personality was a result of Eldest's manipulation and his awakening is caused by Amy's inquisitiveness and tenaciousness. I was glad he was finally able to see the truth of things.Harley and his girlfriend were an excellent examples of people not being able to cope under the pressure of living on the claustrophobic ship surrounded by fakery(there is no substitute for the real thing) because despite his mood swings and obsession problem they were both perfectly sane, despite being labelled crazy.It was completely understandable the almost absurd lengths Eldest went to to impose and maintain the many methods of manipulation in order for everyone to survive.Survival was imperative. Quality of life means nothing in the face of that. Or does it?And that's what this questions.This society may not believe in any religion as we know it but they do have religion: hope.Hope is their \"opium of the masses\" (a Marxist philosophy on the merits of religion) which is a method of control.

Without hope what is there?There are moments, scenes, words of wisdom -that are pure genius and others where I felt baffled, confused and angry when I think I'm reading utter crap.Ideas have been stolen from movies likeSerenity(Phydus is Pax) and the less popularDemolition Man(being conscious in cryo) which makes me wonder how much of this book is original. There is no romance despite the cover (Elder is interested in Amy but not vice versa), and we know who the killer is before the search even begins. Bevis gets the human element right but the science and mystery completely wrong. It's a real mixed bag and it's difficult for me to determine my position on this book, positive or negative.

            "Translation failed for: welcome to...TENANT OF WILD(APRIL) HALL.doesn't roll off the tongue likemiddlemarch march, butelleand i bravely march on in our project of reading long classics in small installments over the course of a month.also - not enough houses have names these days, in my opinion. might start walking around calling my apartment Oakbrook Abbey or some nonsense.anyway. let's do it!DAY 1: CHAPTERS 1 & 2imagine if you were at a party and you made a new friend so you told him about yourself and were like \"what about you, what's your deal\" and he refused to answer and you were like ok weird...and then a few weeks later he starts sending you a series of letters detailing his life story and totaling 576 pages.that is the frame story of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.DAY 2: CHAPTERS 3 & 4it is technically past midnight and i am not sober but i refuse to fall behind on the second day.“'Well! you ladies must always have the last word, I suppose,' said I [...]'You may have as many words as you please,—only I can’t stay to hear them.'”god that goes so hard.i get as much a kick of calling old books feminist as the next guy but...this may be genuinely feminist. will keep you posted.in other news: there are WAY too many names in this, and our narrator is annoying and deserves to be named gilbert.DAY 3: CHAPTERS 5 & 6“[T]his was too disagreeable a supposition to be entertained a moment after it could conveniently be dismissed.”me when i'm deluding myselfgilbert is still pretty annoying but i think helen may be up my alley. what could be better than a b*tchy and mysterious woman???DAY 4: CHAPTERS 7 & 8“Where her opinions and sentiments tallied with mine, it was her extreme good sense, her exquisite taste and feeling, that delighted me; where they differed, it was still her uncompromising boldness in the avowal or defence of that difference, her earnestness and keenness, that piqued my fancy: and even when she angered me by her unkind words or looks, and her uncharitable conclusions respecting me, it only made me the more dissatisfied with myself for having so unfavourably impressed her, and the more desirous to vindicate my character and disposition in her eyes, and, if possible, to win her esteem.”now that is a man written by a woman.i've said it before and i'll say it again: the best straight romance is a man who is obsessed with a girl with no stakes or expectations and she has no idea until a sudden Big Reveal.DAY 5: CHAPTERS 9 & 10just noticed i've quoted from this every day since day 1, which was a plot summary.......not an awesome sign actually!! not pointing towards me having much to say about this!!except that this gilbert fella is a real bozo.DAY 6: CHAPTERS 11 & 12too much drama too early. who cares. it's like how gossip is better when you know who it's about? same thing for love-based angst and declarations and rejections from characters you barely know in romances you didn't even think were happening yet.i did like the part where gilbert laid on the ground, though. that was funny.DAY 7: CHAPTERS 13 & 14at one point in this, a younger brother starts singing a love song to annoy his older brother, who's in a bad mood, until the older brother hits him and he tells on him.the human experience is unchangeable by time.less relatable when gilbert beats some guy on the head with a metal-tipped whip, but ok.it is badass to follow that up with“You may go to the d—l, if you choose—and say I sent you”though.DAY 8: CHAPTERS 15 & 16guys, i'm on vacation.this is another way of saying that the wherewithal it's taking me to continue with this project today is roughly equivalent to conquering a small nation, or pretending to enjoy listening to classical music.it's backstory time for these characs. i was about to say \"finally,\" but we're actually not all that far into this book - it's just comically slow going.“Never fear, my dear! the male fools and reprobates will never want for partners, while there are so many of the other sex to match them.”savage.DAY 9: CHAPTERS 17 & 18it is actually day 11, but i'm going to experiment with something called \"not catching up,\" since i think we have days to spare this month. and also i haven't read in days and i'm not sure i still know how.more of girlfriend's backstory today, and i gotta say: knowing more about her is making me like her less!in conclusion: mr huntingdon is an ass, gilbert is a bozo, and helen is annoying. all star lineup.DAY 10: CHAPTERS 19 & 20still 2 days behind but honestly i think that's pretty impressive for the kind of vacation i am having.this is SO ANNOYING - i have heard 0 reasons why she likes this guy and a hundred not to and we're just expected to be like \"yeah that makes sense that she would marry his ass against the wishes of her combination mother / BFF.\"DAY 11: CHAPTERS 21 & 22it's actually day 14 now, but this book is only 53 chapters long and thereby i do not have to catch up yet. also i don't feel like it, because this hasn't been that fun!mostly it's been one thing, which is \"cut into mercifully short sections.\"helen is very annoying to me and it is funny to read all two (2) of her friends be like...your husband to be is pretty red-faced, are you sure on this one?YOU SHOULD NOT BE SURE, HELEN.also, how ironic that this is the longest day so far. i will never be positive again.DAY 12: CHAPTERS 23 & 24...it's day 16.fellas, is it cheating for your girl to love god?

oh my god. i thought we'd never seen the day.i had completely forgotten this is all a series of letters to some dude who made the grave mistake of expressing casual interest,including hundreds of pages' worth of some woman's journal.jesus. helen has terrible taste AND decision-making skills.DAY 23: CHAPTERS 45 & 46really feeling like ye olde boat beating against the current at the moment.after our narrator has finished reading the manuscript (interrupted by 30 minutes spent GETTING DRESSED) he shows up at helen's house only to refer to her servant and only companion as an \"old virgin.\" insane. missed this guy's antics.if i nearly killed someone by hitting them on the head with a blunt object and then found out they'd actually done nothing wrong, i would have apologized better than \"i'm sorry but idc if you accept.\"AND this guy hits him with\"I clenched my hands and stamped my foot upon the rug.\"these are possibly the most annoying characters in all of classic literature.not him holding hands with helen's brother because they look like hers..............i can't take this anymore.DAY 24: CHAPTERS 47 & 48well, yesterday i was pretty dismal, but i was also reading during commercial breaks from watching my precious sixers lose. so maybe that was why.well.it wasn't that.DAY 25: CHAPTERS 49 & 50a whole new meaning to the phrase \"so close, yet so far.\"\"I never sought his company but with the hope of hearing something about her, and he never sought mine at all, because he saw me often enough without.\"the only person who might find what's his nuts as annoying as i do is poor lawrence.dramatic things are happening, but they don't really feel dramatic because i do not care.DAY 26: CHAPTERS 51 & 52i cannot believe how violent this guy is. this dude is causing permanent brain damage and hurting women on the daily.ellewas talking about how charlotte and emily hid this book for ages and everyone thinks it was because they were jealous, but her theory is that it's actually because it was bad and they should have done a better job.she's right!!!one chapter to go.DAY 27: CHAPTER 53okay awesome i'm so glad these hateful bozos found eternal happiness. whatever.OVERALLin all honesty, this book has none of the charm of jane austen, none of the compelling darkness of wuthering heights, and none of the skillful characters of jane eyre.if anne didn't have the last name brontë, i think there's no way this book would have survived 200 years to remain relevant.it's not even really feminist.rating: 2, error: welcome to...TENANT OF WILD(APRIL) HALL.doesn't roll off the tongue likemiddlemarch march, butelleand i bravely march on in our project of reading long classics in small installments over the course of a month.also - not enough houses have names these days, in my opinion. might start walking around calling my apartment Oakbrook Abbey or some nonsense.anyway. let's do it!DAY 1: CHAPTERS 1 & 2imagine if you were at a party and you made a new friend so you told him about yourself and were like \"what about you, what's your deal\" and he refused to answer and you were like ok weird...and then a few weeks later he starts sending you a series of letters detailing his life story and totaling 576 pages.that is the frame story of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.DAY 2: CHAPTERS 3 & 4it is technically past midnight and i am not sober but i refuse to fall behind on the second day.“'Well! you ladies must always have the last word, I suppose,' said I [...]'You may have as many words as you please,—only I can’t stay to hear them.'”god that goes so hard.i get as much a kick of calling old books feminist as the next guy but...this may be genuinely feminist. will keep you posted.in other news: there are WAY too many names in this, and our narrator is annoying and deserves to be named gilbert.DAY 3: CHAPTERS 5 & 6“[T]his was too disagreeable a supposition to be entertained a moment after it could conveniently be dismissed.”me when i'm deluding myselfgilbert is still pretty annoying but i think helen may be up my alley. what could be better than a b*tchy and mysterious woman???DAY 4: CHAPTERS 7 & 8“Where her opinions and sentiments tallied with mine, it was her extreme good sense, her exquisite taste and feeling, that delighted me; where they differed, it was still her uncompromising boldness in the avowal or defence of that difference, her earnestness and keenness, that piqued my fancy: and even when she angered me by her unkind words or looks, and her uncharitable conclusions respecting me, it only made me the more dissatisfied with myself for having so unfavourably impressed her, and the more desirous to vindicate my character and disposition in her eyes, and, if possible, to win her esteem.”now that is a man written by a woman.i've said it before and i'll say it again: the best straight romance is a man who is obsessed with a girl with no stakes or expectations and she has no idea until a sudden Big Reveal.DAY 5: CHAPTERS 9 & 10just noticed i've quoted from this every day since day 1, which was a plot summary.......not an awesome sign actually!! not pointing towards me having much to say about this!!except that this gilbert fella is a real bozo.DAY 6: CHAPTERS 11 & 12too much drama too early. who cares. it's like how gossip is better when you know who it's about? same thing for love-based angst and declarations and rejections from characters you barely know in romances you didn't even think were happening yet.i did like the part where gilbert laid on the ground, though. that was funny.DAY 7: CHAPTERS 13 & 14at one point in this, a younger brother starts singing a love song to annoy his older brother, who's in a bad mood, until the older brother hits him and he tells on him.the human experience is unchangeable by time.less relatable when gilbert beats some guy on the head with a metal-tipped whip, but ok.it is badass to follow that up with“You may go to the d—l, if you choose—and say I sent you”though.DAY 8: CHAPTERS 15 & 16guys, i'm on vacation.this is another way of saying that the wherewithal it's taking me to continue with this project today is roughly equivalent to conquering a small nation, or pretending to enjoy listening to classical music.it's backstory time for these characs. i was about to say \"finally,\" but we're actually not all that far into this book - it's just comically slow going.“Never fear, my dear! the male fools and reprobates will never want for partners, while there are so many of the other sex to match them.”savage.DAY 9: CHAPTERS 17 & 18it is actually day 11, but i'm going to experiment with something called \"not catching up,\" since i think we have days to spare this month. and also i haven't read in days and i'm not sure i still know how.more of girlfriend's backstory today, and i gotta say: knowing more about her is making me like her less!in conclusion: mr huntingdon is an ass, gilbert is a bozo, and helen is annoying. all star lineup.DAY 10: CHAPTERS 19 & 20still 2 days behind but honestly i think that's pretty impressive for the kind of vacation i am having.this is SO ANNOYING - i have heard 0 reasons why she likes this guy and a hundred not to and we're just expected to be like \"yeah that makes sense that she would marry his ass against the wishes of her combination mother / BFF.\"DAY 11: CHAPTERS 21 & 22it's actually day 14 now, but this book is only 53 chapters long and thereby i do not have to catch up yet. also i don't feel like it, because this hasn't been that fun!mostly it's been one thing, which is \"cut into mercifully short sections.\"helen is very annoying to me and it is funny to read all two (2) of her friends be like...your husband to be is pretty red-faced, are you sure on this one?YOU SHOULD NOT BE SURE, HELEN.also, how ironic that this is the longest day so far. i will never be positive again.DAY 12: CHAPTERS 23 & 24...it's day 16.fellas, is it cheating for your girl to love god? that's space in her heart for another man........a third of this book has been backstory, with no end in sight. can't even find the humor in the phrase \"confounded slut.\"DAY 13: CHAPTERS 25 & 26some things are true throughout time, such as if your significant other is really trying to get you to leave town they are definitely hiding something, and if you're already married it's probably bad.DAY 14: CHAPTERS 27 & 28i want to take back what i said about the feminism of this book. so far it seems mostly hinged on acting like a woman isn't responsible for her emotional actions. or maybe i am just SO SICK OF READING ABOUT THIS TRAGIC MARRIAGE THAT COMMON SENSE AND BASIC DECISION-MAKING RECOMMENDED AGAINST LIKE 11 TIMES!!!DAY 15: CHAPTERS 29 & 30attempting to catch up while the most irritated with this i've been yet. a brilliant idea from me.she goes,\"But I remembered that I had brought all these afflictions, in a manner wilfully, upon myself; and I determined to bear them without a murmur.\"APPARENTLY 15 CHAPTERS DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY AS A MURMUR NOWDAY 16: CHAPTERS 31 & 32i wish i could turn back time just to be like WE GET IT, ANNE.

            "Translation failed for: It's me. Hi. I'm the problem, it's me.Actually, I'm not sure I really AM the problem, but I will admit that if I had the ability to turn off my brain for a couple hours, this would've probably had more of an impact upon me.First, HUGE trigger warning for death of a loved one, specifically cancer. This isn't a spoiler. It's right in the synopsis. But I want to really emphasize it because I personally felt myself thrown when the first few chapters were from Bree's point of view as she's dying from leukemia. As the readers, we are subjected to pretty intense descriptions of what she looks like, how she feels, and what is happening to her body. Even as we get into the book, there are descriptions made comparing Bree to a 'husk' and talking about how sick she looked at any given point in time. For anyone who is at all sensitive to that sort of thing, please take care of yourself.I almost DNF'd this book very early on, because the entire premise is actually ridiculous. I've said it in other reviews, but it bears repeating: if you are setting your story in the real world, you should do your research. It is one of my biggest pet peeves when an author hinges her entire premise around something that isn't right. Let me explain.The whole story revolves around the idea that Bree died with staggering medical debt. Okay, sure. She apparently didn't have insurance at 26 years old, even though she was a successful influencer with almost a million followers on Instagram whose brand revolved around doing all sorts of potentially dangerous things such as mountain climbing, diving, etc. I guess I just don't find it believable that she couldn't afford insurance with that sort of following and I'm assuming sponsorships.But let's just say, for the sake of argument, that she was uninsured when she learned she was sick and accrued hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical debt before she passed. Medical debt is not passed on to a person's family after they die. Any debts get paid out by the person's estate (estate is just a way to say the total assets a person's owned at the time of their death). If there is enough money/assets to pay off the debts, then that is what happens. If not, the debt is labelled as 'insolvent' and goes unpaid. The collector writes off the debt.That little bit of information took me about 10 seconds to look up. 10 seconds. And I know that there are people out there who aren't as pedantic as I am who will think I'm just being nitpicky. And that's totally fine. I'm not out her trying to yuck anyone else's yum. But when I'm reading a book and I pick up on something that doesn't make sense, it bothers me, especially when it's something that is easily fact-checked. Furthermore, the fact that multiple people had to have read this between the first draft and the book's publication and that no one questioned the premise is honestly a little annoying.So at this point, about 20% of the way into the book, I was ready to DNF. We had just barely started the actual bucket list part of the story, I wasn't enjoying the writing style, and the entire premise was based on something that wasn't reality. But when I looked at reviews, there were so many glowing 4 and 5 star reviews. And there were so many that said that the book focused a lot on romance. For some, this was a negative. But honestly, I was just looking for something to look forward to. A few reviews mentioned a twist, but didn't tell us what the twist was, and since I wanted to know, I continued. I should've just DNF'd. For those who are also thinking of DNFing but also wondering the twist is,it's that Kelly is married even though he's having sexy times with Jodie. But of course it's mostly a big misunderstanding because they have been separated for years and just haven't done the paperwork to get divorced. 🙄Anyway, I kept going for the romance, which was a big snooze fest as far as I'm concerned. I think I would've liked them as a couple if the circumstances had been different, but for all the reviews that said this relied too heavily on the romance, I disagree. I wanted more.And learning that Jodie had misconstrued events that happened over a decade earlier and that she'd been the object of all the guys' obsessions didn't do it for me. 'She was pretty the whole time' is a trope that can die in a fire for all I care.I will say, what we learn about the romance in the very last chapter did put me in my feelings. But by then it was too little, too late.As far as the actual bucket list goes, maybe if the book had been more about one sister doing these things in her sister's memory without all the social media nonsense, I think I would've liked it much better. Or they could've even had that as a part of the story, but framed in a different way. Maybe as she's gathering up her sister's belongings she finds the bucket list, and decides on her own to finish the items, and decides to document them on her sister's Instagram as a sort of diary and tribute to her. Then some big company swoops down wanting to sponsor her and help her do some of the more outlandish things on the list, and through that she makes a romantic connection, or something. I don't know, I'm not an author. But between the fact that Jodie is pretty much coerced into completing the bucket list and the gross way the whole thing is handled by the sponsor, it was really difficult to enjoy anything about this.The reason this book gets two stars instead of one is the relationship between Jodie and Claud (Claude? I don't know, I listened to this on audiobook). I was actually far more interested in Claud's relationship with her mother and with the cutie patootie grocer Hopper than I was with anything going on in Jodie's story. And I absolutely loved the way Claud is basically adopted by Jodie's family, and that even though she started out being close to Bree, she cements herself as Jodie's sister and member of the family.Other odds and ends (where I get even nitpickier):1.When they are flying from Sydney to Antarctica, the pilot gets on the overhead speaker right after takeoff and says that they'll be reaching their destination in just under 3 hours. That didn't sound right to me, so I looked it up. Sure enough, a round trip between Sydney and Antarctica is 12-14 hours, meaning it would've been around 6-7 hours to get to their destination. Then a few paragraphs later Jodie herself mentions that it's a 12 hour flight, so I don't know what the heck was going on with the pilot saying 3 hours...unless the author had originally written the book as them going from South America. Because flying from South America to Antarctica actually is a 2-3 hour flight time. So maybe that's a case of bad editing? 🤷🏻‍♀️2.At the end of the book she gets a job working for the Seattle Mariners as a member of their social media team. Her love interest, Kelly, plays as a member of the Tacoma Rainiers, a minor league team in the Mariners system. I thought this was pretty cool. I'm from the Seattle area, and I like baseball, so it was neat to read about this character wanting to do something she loved. But again, my inability to leave well enough alone strikes again. We're told that she goes down to Tacoma for the first day of spring training. As any Mariners fan (really any baseball fan) can tell you, spring training takes place either in Arizona (cactus league) or Florida (grapefruit league). The reason? It's still freaking cold and usually wet in the Pacific Northwest and most of the northern parts of the U.S. in March, which is when spring training occurs. Again...10 seconds of research. I'm begging.3.This one could absolutely be on me. Near the end of the book when Jodie is finally reading Kelly's text messages, the last one is a video of the first time they kissed. But who the hell took the video? She says something about how he never exploited their relationship, but that doesn't explain the video's existence. Like I said, it's totally possible I just forgot that it was Kelly for some reason filming them. Actually, that's probably what it was. But since I was listening to this on audiobook and had already gone back several times in the book when things didn't make sense, I was just done and ready to move on.4. I really didn't like the voice actor on the audiobook. She had this weird whispery voice that started getting on my nerves after awhile. And there wasn't enough differentiation in the voices of any of the women characters, to the point that it was a little confusing. And her accent for the Ryan character was just plain awful. Also, the fact the a 352-page book has a 14+ hour audiobook should be a crime. There was no reason for it to be that long, aside from the fact that voice actor's get paid based on the total run time of the project.I don't see myself reading from this author in the future, even though I think there is a decent story somewhere in the middle of the mess., error: It's me. Hi. I'm the problem, it's me.Actually, I'm not sure I really AM the problem, but I will admit that if I had the ability to turn off my brain for a couple hours, this would've probably had more of an impact upon me.First, HUGE trigger warning for death of a loved one, specifically cancer.

As any Mariners fan (really any baseball fan) can tell you, spring training takes place either in Arizona (cactus league) or Florida (grapefruit league). The reason? It's still freaking cold and usually wet in the Pacific Northwest and most of the northern parts of the U.S. in March, which is when spring training occurs. Again...10 seconds of research. I'm begging.3.This one could absolutely be on me. Near the end of the book when Jodie is finally reading Kelly's text messages, the last one is a video of the first time they kissed. But who the hell took the video? She says something about how he never exploited their relationship, but that doesn't explain the video's existence. Like I said, it's totally possible I just forgot that it was Kelly for some reason filming them. Actually, that's probably what it was. But since I was listening to this on audiobook and had already gone back several times in the book when things didn't make sense, I was just done and ready to move on.4. I really didn't like the voice actor on the audiobook. She had this weird whispery voice that started getting on my nerves after awhile. And there wasn't enough differentiation in the voices of any of the women characters, to the point that it was a little confusing. And her accent for the Ryan character was just plain awful. Also, the fact the a 352-page book has a 14+ hour audiobook should be a crime. There was no reason for it to be that long, aside from the fact that voice actor's get paid based on the total run time of the project.I don't see myself reading from this author in the future, even though I think there is a decent story somewhere in the middle of the mess. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: Wow. Just… Wow. Where to even begin with this?I first read this book years ago and I rememberlovingit. It had a friends with benefits trope, which I really like, and I remember thinking Braden was the hottest thing to ever happen to the world.When I decided to reread it, I very much kept in mind that it was published in 2012, probably written in 2011. Romancelandia was a very different landscape 10 years ago. There was plenty of slut-shaming, for one, among many other things. Times have changed a lot and I’m sure the author would write many of these things differently if she were to write this book today, so I’m going to let a lot it slide.With that said, there were things I just… could not get past. So let’s get to it!Joss Butler grew up in the United States with her picture perfect family, loving parents and a little sister. However, when she was only fourteen, they all died in a massive car crash. From that point on, her life basically became a series of tragic events – which are slowly revealed throughout the book – until she turned eighteen and inherited a ton of money, which prompted her to move all the way to Edinburgh, her mother’s hometown, for college.We meet Joss as she’s twenty-two; after graduation, she decided to start working as a bartender (for the “social interaction”, since she’s filthy rich) while she writes her first book. At this point, her college best friend and roommate has moved to London, which forces her to start looking for a new apartment.Enter Ellie, who’s essentially a manic pixie dream girl who lives in a luxurious apartment on Dublin Street and is also looking for a roommate (also for the “social interaction”, since she’s also filthy rich). Joss and Ellie immediately hit it off and decide to live together.Our hero is Braden Carmichael (sexy name, A+). Braden is Ellie’s overprotective older brother, who is taken with Joss from the moment they meet while sharing a cab, before Joss and Ellie even meet.Braden is the quintessential 2012 romance hero: possessive, jealous, controlling, entitled, all the things. Those traits didn’t bother me exactly; what bothered me was, well, everything else about him. He’s the kind of guy who won’t take no for an answer (and not in a nice way), he constantly tries to manipulate Joss into entering a romantic relationship with him, which she tells him all the time she doesn’t want to do (and means it), he gets insanely pissed off when she tells him she doesn’t love him and calls her a frigid bitch or something else crazy, he bulldozes through every boundary she sets… I couldn’t deal! I told myself this wasn’t written today about a thousand times, but I still couldn’t deal. I’m sorry, lol.Now, let’s talk Joss. She had, understandably, a lot of issues regarding her family’s death and other awful things she went through. She wouldn’t let anyone get close enough to hurt her. This was a very overused trope and here’s why I didn’t find it super annoying:1. She’s only twenty-two! Twenty-two gets a break, lol.2. She’s very practical. As soon as she starts having panic attacks, in the beginning of the book, she goes off and finds herself a therapist. In the beginning of the book! I thought she was very self-aware.3. She doesn’t play games. She never played hard to get with Braden; she was always very clear about what she did and didn’t want. If he chose not to listen to her (most times), that wasn’t on her.The other thing I could not get past was Adam. Adam is Braden’s lifelong best friend and Ellie’s lifelong crush. Years ago (which, she’s twenty-three now, so, how long ago exactly? Please tell me she wasn’t a teenager, that would have been so much worse), Adam and Ellie almost slept together, until, while she wasnakedandunder him, he freaked out about how Braden would never forgive him, and threw her out. I mean… what?! If this was a situation of “I won’t be with you because of your brother, blah blah blah”, I would move on, but the fact that he took it as far as taking her clothes off and then completely humiliated her? I mean, I would never get past this.As if that wasn’t enough, Ellie is supposed to be bubbly and kind and all the things, so she straight up forgives him and never talks about it again. What?! And then! Adam sabotages all of her dates and doesn’t let any man near her, while he dates around whoever he wants! Again - what?! Also!! He was in her face all the time, treating like a child and telling her what’s best for her,in front of her actual familyand no one ever said a word?? I just could not with this. I hate Adam with a passion.Oh, man, I’m kind of sorry I went back to read this book, because I didn’t want to have all these negative feelings towards it. I really tried to give it a break, but some things were so infuriating I just couldn’t. If you read this book and loved it, I totally get it – I used to love it too! It was very appealing at one point in time. I guess it just… didn’t age well., error: Wow. Po prostu... Wow. Od czego zacząć? Przeczytałam tę książkę kilka lat temu i pamiętam, że ją uwielbiałam. Zawierała motyw przyjaciół z korzyściami, który bardzo mi się podobał, i pamiętam, że myślałam, że Braden to najgorętsza rzecz, jaka kiedykolwiek przytrafiła się światu. Kiedy zdecydowałam się ją przeczytać ponownie, bardzo pamiętałam, że została wydana w 2012 roku, prawdopodobnie napisana w 2011 roku. Romancelandia była zupełnie innym krajobrazem 10 lat temu. Było mnóstwo zawstydzania rozwiązłości, między innymi. Czasy bardzo się zmieniły i jestem pewna, że ​​autorka napisałaby wiele z tych rzeczy inaczej, gdyby napisała tę książkę dzisiaj, więc wiele z nich pominę. Mimo to były rzeczy, których po prostu... nie mogłam pominąć. Więc do dzieła! Joss Butler dorastała w Stanach Zjednoczonych z idealną rodziną, kochającymi rodzicami i młodszą siostrą. Jednak gdy miała zaledwie czternaście lat, wszyscy zginęli w potężnym wypadku samochodowym. Od tego momentu jej życie stało się serią tragicznych wydarzeń – które powoli ujawniają się w całej książce – aż do momentu, gdy skończyła osiemnaście lat i odziedziczyła mnóstwo pieniędzy, co skłoniło ją do przeprowadzki do Edynburga, rodzinnego miasta jej matki, na studia. Poznajemy Joss, gdy ma dwadzieścia dwa lata; po ukończeniu studiów postanowiła zacząć pracę jako barmanka (dla „interakcji towarzyskich”, ponieważ jest obrzydliwie bogata), podczas gdy pisze swoją pierwszą książkę. W tym momencie jej najlepsza przyjaciółka ze studiów i współlokatorka przeprowadziła się do Londynu, co zmusza ją do rozpoczęcia poszukiwań nowego mieszkania. Pojawia się Ellie, która jest w zasadzie maniakalną dziewczyną z marzeń, która mieszka w luksusowym apartamencie na Dublin Street i również szuka współlokatorki (również dla „interakcji towarzyskich”, ponieważ jest również obrzydliwie bogata). Joss i Ellie od razu się dogadują i decydują się zamieszkać razem. Naszym bohaterem jest Braden Carmichael (seksowne imię, A+). Braden jest nadopiekuńczym starszym bratem Ellie, który jest oczarowany Joss od momentu, gdy poznali się podczas wspólnej taksówki, zanim jeszcze Joss i Ellie się poznali. Braden jest kwintesencją bohatera romansów z 2012 roku: zaborczy, zazdrosny, kontrolujący, roszczeniowy, wszystko. Te cechy nie przeszkadzały mi dokładnie; przeszkadzało mi, cóż, wszystko inne w nim. To typ faceta, który nie przyjmuje odpowiedzi „nie” (i nie w miły sposób), ciągle próbuje manipulować Joss, aby weszła z nim w romantyczny związek, czego ona ciągle mu mówi, że nie chce (i tak właśnie myśli), wścieka się jak szalony, gdy ona mówi mu, że go nie kocha i nazywa ją lodowatą suką lub czymś innym szalonym, przebija się przez każdą granicę, którą ona wyznacza... Nie mogłam sobie z tym poradzić! Mówiłam sobie, że to nie zostało napisane dzisiaj, tysiąc razy, ale nadal nie mogłam sobie z tym poradzić. Przepraszam, lol. Teraz porozmawiajmy o Joss. Miała, co zrozumiałe, wiele problemów związanych ze śmiercią rodziny i innymi okropnymi rzeczami, przez które przeszła. Nie pozwalała nikomu zbliżyć się na tyle, by zrobić jej krzywdę. To był bardzo nadużywany motyw i oto dlaczego nie wydał mi się super irytujący: 1. Ma zaledwie dwadzieścia dwa lata! Dwadzieścia dwa lata mają przerwę, lol. 2. Jest bardzo praktyczna. Jak tylko zaczyna mieć ataki paniki, na początku książki, odchodzi i znajduje sobie terapeutę. Na początku książki! Uważałam, że jest bardzo świadoma siebie. 3. Nie gra w gry. Nigdy nie grała na siłę z Bradenem; zawsze jasno mówiła, czego chce, a czego nie. Jeśli on nie chciał jej słuchać (w większości przypadków), to nie była jej wina. Inną rzeczą, której nie mogłam pominąć, był Adam. Adam jest najlepszym przyjacielem Bradena od zawsze i obiektem westchnień Ellie od zawsze. Lata temu (a ona ma teraz dwadzieścia trzy lata, więc ile dokładnie? Proszę, powiedz mi, że nie była nastolatką, to byłoby o wiele gorsze), Adam i Ellie prawie się przespali, aż do momentu, gdy była naga i pod nim, gdy spanikował, że Braden nigdy mu nie wybaczy i ją wyrzucił. Co?! Gdyby to była sytuacja „nie będę z tobą z powodu twojego brata, bla bla bla”, poszłabym dalej, ale fakt, że posunął się tak daleko, że zdjął jej ubrania, a potem ją całkowicie upokorzył? Nigdy bym tego nie przezwyciężyła. Jakby tego było mało, Ellie ma być wesoła i miła i tak dalej, więc ona mu po prostu wybacza i nigdy więcej o tym nie wspomina. Co?! A potem! Adam sabotuje wszystkie jej randki i nie pozwala żadnemu facetowi się do niej zbliżać, podczas gdy sam umawia się z kim chce! Znów – co?! A także!! On był cały czas w jej obecności, traktował ją jak dziecko i mówił jej, co jest dla niej najlepsze, w obecności jej prawdziwej rodziny i nikt nigdy nie powiedział ani słowa?? Po prostu nie mogłam tego znieść. Nienawidzę Adama z pasją. Och, człowieku, trochę mi przykro, że wróciłam do czytania tej książki, ponieważ nie chciałam mieć w stosunku do niej wszystkich tych negatywnych uczuć. Naprawdę starałam się dać jej spokój, ale niektóre rzeczy były tak wkurzające, że po prostu nie mogłam. Jeśli przeczytałeś tę książkę i ją pokochałeś, całkowicie to rozumiem – ja też ją kiedyś kochałam! Była bardzo atrakcyjna w pewnym momencie. Chyba po prostu… nie zestarzała się dobrze. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: Warning:There is a lot of negativity in this review. Please don't get all \"If you don't have anything nice to say DON'T SAY IT AT ALL!\"Please. The point of reviewing is to share one's personal thoughts of the book. The point is to share the opinions even when they differ from others. Because they'reopinions. It really doesn't take any longer to rant than it does to rave, and either way it's to express strong thoughts and feelings. I want to express myself. Besides, I'm typing all this on my nook during free time at school so I'm not exactly missing anything.Now, first order of business -LOOK AT THAT COVER!I DEMAND THEE TO LOOK AT IT! I swear the covers are the best part of the series and this is my favorite. It's gorgeous and it's my bird boy; who remains to be pretty much the only character I really like. TheDestinedcover sucks though. Just saying.Now I move onto my very long explanation of my feelings on this series sinceMarked. I'd really rather not do eight separate reviews so I figure I'll combine them all here.First of all, to summarize my feelings of HoN:I didn't likeMarked. I really didn't. At the time I suffered from an OCD of finishing any series I'd started and that's pretty much the only reason why I moved ontoBetrayed. Also... I was not aware it would be12 freaking novels. I continued beyond the sequel because it did get a little better with each book. I even found myself starting to enjoy the series to some sick extent. The Cast can't hardly write decent characters but they do have an interesting mythology to their world. In the beginning I was very intrigued by the idea of Wiccan-like vampires, as well as the other crap they kept adding.Sadly, the series has dragged the plot through the mud and back. Zoey and the gang rarely solve anything while villains and problems just keep coming. It's hard to believe they haven't been sleeping for the past eight books for all the progress they've made! Along with that, the mythology that once interested me has been piled and piled onto and is now a mess. I all but smashed my head against the wall when they decided to add fae into the mix atAwakened(or perhapsBurnedsince sprites were mentioned). What's the point? Eight books and you've decided to add a completely different species out of the blue for no particular reason at all? I think the Cast team bit off more than they could chew with a 12 book contract and are just trying to stretch it as thin as possible to fill the requirement.It's all probably connected - which is why it's been able to hold me thus far - but now I'm just tired of it all. It's the story that never ends and can no longer make up for the horrible characterization and teen drama.And yes, the characters are awful and only get worse. I think I might have just gotten used to it; perhaps in the same way one might get used to a foul odor if they deal with it long enough. Must have not been as accustomed as I thought because it did get to me.My main problem is the protagonist: Zoey Redbird. I've actually hated her from the beginning. She's the beautiful Chosen One of the Goddess Nyx- meaning Nyx basically justdecidedto make her the most powerful fledgling/vampire in history by gifting her with all 5 elements. Most vampires only get one gift (if they're lucky) but Zoey gets five right off the bat for no particular reason except she's just that superuberspecial. After becoming chosen, Zoey transfers to her new school. It's there she immediately gains a group of friends. It's there she brings down the seemingly untouchable Queen Bee. It's there she quickly becomes the leader of the school's most prestigious club. It's there she takes on the esteemed role of High Priestess in training. It's there she begins a relationship with literally the hottest guy in school, while her ex continues to pine for her as if she herself is a goddess.This is all just the first book.The first 306-paged book.By this point I know I've been exposed to the worst case of Mary Sue sinceTwilight. In fact, now that I think of it, both these chicks are vapid lovers of prissy vamps and have last names relating to birds. How precious.Zoey really just gets worse from there. I pitied her at some points but that was largely due to my own deep hatred of Nefret and Heath. Truth is: Zoey is immature, hypocritical, shallow, and stupid. She judges and complains about anyone different from herself. I was particularly offended by her sneering of goths, or rather, \"losers\" as she calls them. I've never considered myself goth but I've always loved black, spikes, and skulls so people typically assumed I am, or used to. I was criticized by other kids in both middle and high school for being \"the creepy goth girl.\" Thankfully, I haven't had to deal with that in recent years but I haven't forgotten about it. It made me sympathetic towards kids who really are goth, to say the least.The protagonist is supposed to be someoneyoucan relate to, not your bullies.And isn't at least one goth going to pick up a vampire book? Not to be stereotypical but... seriously!?Zoey certainly has the makings of a bully, such as stressing her positive qualities in light of others negative qualities. Like how she's not like \"those freak anorexic girls\" or those girls \"with the raccoon eyes.\" Alright, Zoey. We understand you're not like those silly girls with the horrible mental illness that kills millions of teenagers every year. And thank you for reminding us whatFREAKSthey are! And, like, no way! It's so interesting how thin you apply your eyeliner. The fact you're specifically not like the \"raccoon girls\" makes me like you more as a person.To make a point of how both judgmental and hypocritical she is: The slut bashing. She talks trash about girls she finds slutty and loves to chortle about what a \"skanky ho\" Aphrodite is. Girls like that are bellow Zoey, who would never doanythingthat's considered slutty. Oh no! She might be getting into sexually charged bloodsucking with her ex while flirting with her teacher but that doesn't make her disloyal to her current boyfriend!In all seriousness... this girl is ridiculous when it comes to men. I remember her saying something along the lines of:\"It doesn't feel like I'm a slut, it feels like I'm attracted to multiple guys.\"No, honey. Just no.There's nothing wrong with being attracted to multiple people at once. It happens. However, it is wrong to act on that attraction while in a relationship. Zoey basically accepted the idea of having \"three boyfriends\" like it was an accident. Her \"official\" boyfriend was Erik, who had no idea she was involved with Heath and Loren. You guys remember Loren, right? The teacher who Erik caught shaking up with Zoey? She cheated on him, plain and simple and yet... amazingly, they make ERIK the bad guy for being angry. Yes, he said some harsh things to Zoey but for crap's sake he walked in on her and Loren in a naked embrace! It's bad enough to know you've been cheated on but it's got to be so much worse to actually see it. If the situation had been reversed, Zoey and her friends would no doubt be spitting fire about what a jerk Erik was for sleeping with some \"ho-bag.\" But the situation isn't reversed. Instead her friends comfort her from the big bad (now ex) boyfriend.I'm not even getting started on Kalona and Stark. There just aren't enough characters allowed on goodreads reviews for me to go on and on about how Zoey is a classic TSTL protagonist that attracts unrealistically gorgeous men just by breathing... or that she develops an attachment to one of them despite knowing he's a thousand or so year old serial rapist and murderer. In a sense, I understand the circumstances made it difficult for hernotto have an attachment. Even so, she allowed herself to be unnecessarily vulnerable and trusting towards someone she knew was the enemy. It took him killing Heath in front of her to finally accept he truly was evil.A lot of people dismiss her messing around with different guys because it's acceptable for a High Priestess to have a warrior, a human consul, and a vampire lover. This could be a legitimate part of their culture but it also sounds like an excuse. Keep in mind she didn't even find out about this until AFTER the Heath/Erik/Loren fiasco so it's not as if she was just embracing customs. It really could have always been part of the plan, but at the point of revelation it's as if the authors were just yelling:\"SEE! IT'S OKAY, SHE'S NOT A SLUT!!!\"Actually it still doesn't seem right. Does it count when your consul and warrior are also basically your lovers? And should it really be justified if it hurts the guys involved? It's true they accepted her inability to commit because they wanted her happy, but they were obviously unhappy with it considering they were committed to her alone. I get not everyone is into monogamy, but this is just selfish no matter what.Her screwing around also got in the way of the plot too much. The world is falling into chaos but Zoey likes to spend most of her thinking time mooning over how troublesome it is to juggle boyfriends.Oh man, I could go on but really shouldn't.The supporting characters helped but as the series progressed they became less important. Or rather, maybe they justseemless important because I'm so tired of them. They really became more like like Zoey's litter of loyal puppies and comedy props than actual people. The Twins werekind offunny at first but then just got repetitive. Damien is alright and actually seems to have a brain cell but that's about it. Jack was sweet but he was little more than technologically-skilled arm candy. Aphrodite is a rival turned ally and actually had some depth. I started liking Aphrodite and her blunt ways, especially because she was the only one who really bothered to knock sense into Zoey. HOWEVER, her sour attitude also became repetitive and now she just seems obnoxious. Every time she talks I imagine her screeching in my ear.Heath... oh Heath. No one is this stupid. No one. He was a fracking damsel in distress with a dick. He has his place in the plot later in the books, but he really just came off as this unnecessary love interest that obsessively followed Zoey. When not doing that, all he did was moronically stumble into danger and Zoey would nearly kill herself protecting him. Heath's head was so far up his ass he could tongue his intestines. When I picture him, he's a studly blond with an crap-eating smile and eyes that stare as if the lights are on but no one's home. He'd just pop out of nowhere to smother Zoey with his\"It's you and me babe!\"drivel. It was disgusting and it was greedy. He loved her so much but all he really did was complicate her life by constantly pursuing her and making it difficult for her to move on. It was all abouthimevery time he tried to shove himself into her existence, even after the first five or so times she said they were over. It's why I actually managed to be proud of him when he finally let her go inBurned. It was a little over due but it's nice that he finally decided to do something for her own good.I like Stevie Rae. Sue me. I didn't care for her much at first but the rebirth gave her an interesting perspective on life. Though honestly, I don't think I would've liked her nearly as much if it wasn't for Zoey. Being inside Stevie Rae's head was like popping a pain killer after such a long time in Zoey's head. I felt brain cells dying whenever I read that girl's raw thoughts and spoken words. I'm not even kidding.There were times while reading Zoey's POV where my brain felt as if it were suffocating!You know the aching yet empty feeling of a tooth cavity?That's what my head felt like whenever she said something particularly stupid.Scared the crap out of me!Many hated the switch from first person to third person narrative but I loved it. I prefer third person because I believe it opens the story more when you're able to see it through the eyes of others. It's especially exhilarating when you have a protagonist like Zoey to take a break from.I loved Stevie Rae's relationship with Rephaim. Loved it. I remember I was actually getting sick ofHouse of NightbyTemptedand it was the introduction of their relationship that kept my interest. I wanted to find what would become of them and I wanted to find out more about Rephaim. He eventually became my favorite character because I loved his design, as well as his lack of atrocious excuses for \"teen talk\" the Cast infected the others with. Ugh.Their relationship was also refreshing because it was different. Being inside Zoey's head was all: HOT GUY HOT GUY SMOKING HOT GUY LUST UBER SEXY EPIC LURV HOTTIE HOT GUY EPIC LURV WITH NEW SMEXY GUY SEX DROOL HOT GUY NEW LURV WITH DIFFERENT GUY HOT GUY HOT GUY. Seriously, there might have been some feelings in there but it was majorly just all flawless men and heated physical passion. With Rephaim and Stevie Rae it was emotional. Obviously it didn't start with looks but instead bonding from mutual trust and respect. It's very Beauty and the Beast but hey, I like it. Especially after the sausage-fest of fecking perfect men.So yeah, I read on and I adoredBurned. It's my favorite in the series because Zoey was absent for most of it and I got to see the development of Stevie Rae's new romance. It's the only book I gave five stars and I read it like fanfiction... Sad.Now, I'm going to take a little aside to do some defending. I've done enough tearing down, so I'm going to take a break to build up.Stevie Rae didn't become a new Zoey. She may have been nursing Rephaim while dating Dallas but her intentions were completely unromantic. She didn't accept her growing feelings for Rephaim until after it was over between her and Dallas. It was hard for her to realize she even had feelings. And there was that other guy people keep bringing up... whose name I cannot recall. I don't even count him because all they had was a quick interest in each other back when she was Blue. I don't think they were even official, but either way it was over with after she died. They don't see each other again until several books later and then it's just this very brief moment of \"Oh hey, it's nice to see you! I'm so glad we're not dead!\" So Stevie Rae has had more than one love interest but she can actually move from one to the other, unlike Zoey, who just juggles them all at once. I also felt Zoey's relations mostly consisted of: \"You're hot. I'm hot. I feel so drawn to you somehow...\" It came slower with Rephaim and Stevie Rae but that's what made it seem like something was actually there. They made each other better people.Rephaim also gets a bad reputation because his daddy is the thousand year old serial murder/rapist Zoey had a thing for, and he's done some killing himself. Maybe raping, I don't know. What makes it different for me is that Kalona chose to become the way he was; Rephaim was raised into it. Once he started realizing what light was compared to darkness and what it really meant to love and be loved, once he realized he could possibly change he actually wanted to. And he did. That was part of what made his story with Stevie Rae so great to me. Kalona was a story of falling from grace; Rephaim was a story of redemption.If there's anything I don't regret about reading this series, it would be the relationship between this Raven Mocker and Red Vampyre. Bird Boy and Okie. They were a very lovely and interesting development.But even their relationship alone can't hold me anymore. I loved the outcome even though I found him to be a bit whipped in this book. I was very touched by Kalona's decision but really none of this can make up for the declining plot and crappy characters.Diving deeper into that: What is with this language??? The Cast team try so hard to sound like teenagers and they fail so hard it embarrasses me to evenbea teenager. Supposedly P.C Cast was a high school English teacher and that's where she got her material from. I have never, in my life, heard anyone speak with such idiocy. There's a lot of valley girl slang and fabricated words and I haven't heard either since late elementary to early middle school. Though I will admit, I have a friend who's a few years older than I and he does recognize some of the lingo... from the 90's. The phrases and words used in this book have no business in 2007 and beyond. I also heard that P.C writes and Kristin goes in and \"teen-ifys\" it. Well Kristin...STOP IT!Just...Just stop it!Who says \"hee-hee's\"? WHO??? And another thing about Zoey... what's with a 17 year old girl using the word \"poopie\"??? I hate that word. I cannot stand that word. From toddler to tween, my younger sister used that word as a substitute for almost every adjective available. My mom, my dad, and myself all tried to train her out of it because we're just so sick of hearing it. There's just no one who would actually make that word a part of their daily vocabulary. I get that this is supposed to be some kind of endearing character quirk of hers... it's not.There were a lot of problems with the writing. I'm not going to bother getting into them all. I will say there were a lot of inconsistencies. The only one that immediately comes to mind happens to be in this book. It's when Stevie Rae drove Zoey's car.... the car that was stolen at the end of the last book. There was no explanation of how it got back. No hint it had ever been gone. It was just... there. Also had problems with all the pop culture references! These can be fun IN MINIMUM but this series is so stuffed full of Glee and Trueblood you'd think they were being paid to advertise. Heck, there's a scene inDestineddedicated to a not-so-subtle advertisement of the Sookie Stackhouse series. One that could only logically be completed with a cheesy grin and thumbs up at the camera.And just... ugh... There's nothing for me anymore. I couldn't even get 40 pages intoDestinedbefore I closed the book, put my head in my hands, and wondered why I was wasting my life. I could barely even gather the energy to read that far and it's safe to say I will never pick it up again. I've even lost the fire to continue with this review/rant. I don't blame anyone for liking this series because I was oddly addicted to it for some time as well. But seriously: I'm tired of the plot, I hate the main character, I'm sick of her twisted love life, and I'm saddened by herfellow twitsfriends. There is nothing for me. I quit., error: Warning:There is a lot of negativity in this review. Please don't get all \"If you don't have anything nice to say DON'T SAY IT AT ALL!\"Please.

I continued beyond the sequel because it did get a little better with each book. I even found myself starting to enjoy the series to some sick extent. The Cast can't hardly write decent characters but they do have an interesting mythology to their world. In the beginning I was very intrigued by the idea of Wiccan-like vampires, as well as the other crap they kept adding.Sadly, the series has dragged the plot through the mud and back. Zoey and the gang rarely solve anything while villains and problems just keep coming. It's hard to believe they haven't been sleeping for the past eight books for all the progress they've made! Along with that, the mythology that once interested me has been piled and piled onto and is now a mess. I all but smashed my head against the wall when they decided to add fae into the mix atAwakened(or perhapsBurnedsince sprites were mentioned). What's the point? Eight books and you've decided to add a completely different species out of the blue for no particular reason at all? I think the Cast team bit off more than they could chew with a 12 book contract and are just trying to stretch it as thin as possible to fill the requirement.It's all probably connected - which is why it's been able to hold me thus far - but now I'm just tired of it all. It's the story that never ends and can no longer make up for the horrible characterization and teen drama.And yes, the characters are awful and only get worse. I think I might have just gotten used to it; perhaps in the same way one might get used to a foul odor if they deal with it long enough. Must have not been as accustomed as I thought because it did get to me.My main problem is the protagonist: Zoey Redbird. I've actually hated her from the beginning. She's the beautiful Chosen One of the Goddess Nyx- meaning Nyx basically justdecidedto make her the most powerful fledgling/vampire in history by gifting her with all 5 elements. Most vampires only get one gift (if they're lucky) but Zoey gets five right off the bat for no particular reason except she's just that superuberspecial. After becoming chosen, Zoey transfers to her new school. It's there she immediately gains a group of friends. It's there she brings down the seemingly untouchable Queen Bee. It's there she quickly becomes the leader of the school's most prestigious club. It's there she takes on the esteemed role of High Priestess in training. It's there she begins a relationship with literally the hottest guy in school, while her ex continues to pine for her as if she herself is a goddess.This is all just the first book.The first 306-paged book.By this point I know I've been exposed to the worst case of Mary Sue sinceTwilight. In fact, now that I think of it, both these chicks are vapid lovers of prissy vamps and have last names relating to birds. How precious.Zoey really just gets worse from there. I pitied her at some points but that was largely due to my own deep hatred of Nefret and Heath. Truth is: Zoey is immature, hypocritical, shallow, and stupid. She judges and complains about anyone different from herself. I was particularly offended by her sneering of goths, or rather, \"losers\" as she calls them. I've never considered myself goth but I've always loved black, spikes, and skulls so people typically assumed I am, or used to. I was criticized by other kids in both middle and high school for being \"the creepy goth girl.\" Thankfully, I haven't had to deal with that in recent years but I haven't forgotten about it. It made me sympathetic towards kids who really are goth, to say the least.The protagonist is supposed to be someoneyoucan relate to, not your bullies.And isn't at least one goth going to pick up a vampire book? Not to be stereotypical but... seriously!?Zoey certainly has the makings of a bully, such as stressing her positive qualities in light of others negative qualities. Like how she's not like \"those freak anorexic girls\" or those girls \"with the raccoon eyes.\" Alright, Zoey. We understand you're not like those silly girls with the horrible mental illness that kills millions of teenagers every year. And thank you for reminding us whatFREAKSthey are! And, like, no way! It's so interesting how thin you apply your eyeliner. The fact you're specifically not like the \"raccoon girls\" makes me like you more as a person.To make a point of how both judgmental and hypocritical she is: The slut bashing. She talks trash about girls she finds slutty and loves to chortle about what a \"skanky ho\" Aphrodite is. Girls like that are bellow Zoey, who would never doanythingthat's considered slutty. Oh no! She might be getting into sexually charged bloodsucking with her ex while flirting with her teacher but that doesn't make her disloyal to her current boyfriend!In all seriousness... this girl is ridiculous when it comes to men. I remember her saying something along the lines of:\"It doesn't feel like I'm a slut, it feels like I'm attracted to multiple guys.\"No, honey. Just no.There's nothing wrong with being attracted to multiple people at once. It happens. However, it is wrong to act on that attraction while in a relationship. Zoey basically accepted the idea of having \"three boyfriends\" like it was an accident. Her \"official\" boyfriend was Erik, who had no idea she was involved with Heath and Loren. You guys remember Loren, right? The teacher who Erik caught shaking up with Zoey? She cheated on him, plain and simple and yet... amazingly, they make ERIK the bad guy for being angry. Yes, he said some harsh things to Zoey but for crap's sake he walked in on her and Loren in a naked embrace! It's bad enough to know you've been cheated on but it's got to be so much worse to actually see it. If the situation had been reversed, Zoey and her friends would no doubt be spitting fire about what a jerk Erik was for sleeping with some \"ho-bag.\" But the situation isn't reversed. Instead her friends comfort her from the big bad (now ex) boyfriend.I'm not even getting started on Kalona and Stark. There just aren't enough characters allowed on goodreads reviews for me to go on and on about how Zoey is a classic TSTL protagonist that attracts unrealistically gorgeous men just by breathing... or that she develops an attachment to one of them despite knowing he's a thousand or so year old serial rapist and murderer. In a sense, I understand the circumstances made it difficult for hernotto have an attachment. Even so, she allowed herself to be unnecessarily vulnerable and trusting towards someone she knew was the enemy. It took him killing Heath in front of her to finally accept he truly was evil.A lot of people dismiss her messing around with different guys because it's acceptable for a High Priestess to have a warrior, a human consul, and a vampire lover. This could be a legitimate part of their culture but it also sounds like an excuse. Keep in mind she didn't even find out about this until AFTER the Heath/Erik/Loren fiasco so it's not as if she was just embracing customs. It really could have always been part of the plan, but at the point of revelation it's as if the authors were just yelling:\"SEE! IT'S OKAY, SHE'S NOT A SLUT!!!\"Actually it still doesn't seem right. Does it count when your consul and warrior are also basically your lovers? And should it really be justified if it hurts the guys involved? It's true they accepted her inability to commit because they wanted her happy, but they were obviously unhappy with it considering they were committed to her alone. I get not everyone is into monogamy, but this is just selfish no matter what.Her screwing around also got in the way of the plot too much. The world is falling into chaos but Zoey likes to spend most of her thinking time mooning over how troublesome it is to juggle boyfriends.Oh man, I could go on but really shouldn't.The supporting characters helped but as the series progressed they became less important. Or rather, maybe they justseemless important because I'm so tired of them. They really became more like like Zoey's litter of loyal puppies and comedy props than actual people. The Twins werekind offunny at first but then just got repetitive. Damien is alright and actually seems to have a brain cell but that's about it. Jack was sweet but he was little more than technologically-skilled arm candy. Aphrodite is a rival turned ally and actually had some depth. I started liking Aphrodite and her blunt ways, especially because she was the only one who really bothered to knock sense into Zoey. HOWEVER, her sour attitude also became repetitive and now she just seems obnoxious. Every time she talks I imagine her screeching in my ear.Heath... oh Heath. No one is this stupid. No one. He was a fracking damsel in distress with a dick. He has his place in the plot later in the books, but he really just came off as this unnecessary love interest that obsessively followed Zoey. When not doing that, all he did was moronically stumble into danger and Zoey would nearly kill herself protecting him. Heath's head was so far up his ass he could tongue his intestines. When I picture him, he's a studly blond with an crap-eating smile and eyes that stare as if the lights are on but no one's home. He'd just pop out of nowhere to smother Zoey with his\"It's you and me babe!\"drivel. It was disgusting and it was greedy. He loved her so much but all he really did was complicate her life by constantly pursuing her and making it difficult for her to move on. It was all abouthimevery time he tried to shove himself into her existence, even after the first five or so times she said they were over. It's why I actually managed to be proud of him when he finally let her go inBurned. It was a little over due but it's nice that he finally decided to do something for her own good.I like Stevie Rae. Sue me. I didn't care for her much at first but the rebirth gave her an interesting perspective on life. Though honestly, I don't think I would've liked her nearly as much if it wasn't for Zoey. Being inside Stevie Rae's head was like popping a pain killer after such a long time in Zoey's head. I felt brain cells dying whenever I read that girl's raw thoughts and spoken words. I'm not even kidding.There were times while reading Zoey's POV where my brain felt as if it were suffocating!You know the aching yet empty feeling of a tooth cavity?That's what my head felt like whenever she said something particularly stupid.Scared the crap out of me!Many hated the switch from first person to third person narrative but I loved it. I prefer third person because I believe it opens the story more when you're able to see it through the eyes of others. It's especially exhilarating when you have a protagonist like Zoey to take a break from.I loved Stevie Rae's relationship with Rephaim. Loved it. I remember I was actually getting sick ofHouse of NightbyTemptedand it was the introduction of their relationship that kept my interest. I wanted to find what would become of them and I wanted to find out more about Rephaim. He eventually became my favorite character because I loved his design, as well as his lack of atrocious excuses for \"teen talk\" the Cast infected the others with. Ugh.Their relationship was also refreshing because it was different. Being inside Zoey's head was all: HOT GUY HOT GUY SMOKING HOT GUY LUST UBER SEXY EPIC LURV HOTTIE HOT GUY EPIC LURV WITH NEW SMEXY GUY SEX DROOL HOT GUY NEW LURV WITH DIFFERENT GUY HOT GUY HOT GUY. Seriously, there might have been some feelings in there but it was majorly just all flawless men and heated physical passion. With Rephaim and Stevie Rae it was emotional. Obviously it didn't start with looks but instead bonding from mutual trust and respect. It's very Beauty and the Beast but hey, I like it. Especially after the sausage-fest of fecking perfect men.So yeah, I read on and I adoredBurned. It's my favorite in the series because Zoey was absent for most of it and I got to see the development of Stevie Rae's new romance. It's the only book I gave five stars and I read it like fanfiction... Sad.Now, I'm going to take a little aside to do some defending. I've done enough tearing down, so I'm going to take a break to build up.Stevie Rae didn't become a new Zoey. She may have been nursing Rephaim while dating Dallas but her intentions were completely unromantic. She didn't accept her growing feelings for Rephaim until after it was over between her and Dallas. It was hard for her to realize she even had feelings. And there was that other guy people keep bringing up... whose name I cannot recall. I don't even count him because all they had was a quick interest in each other back when she was Blue. I don't think they were even official, but either way it was over with after she died. They don't see each other again until several books later and then it's just this very brief moment of \"Oh hey, it's nice to see you! I'm so glad we're not dead!\" So Stevie Rae has had more than one love interest but she can actually move from one to the other, unlike Zoey, who just juggles them all at once. I also felt Zoey's relations mostly consisted of: \"You're hot. I'm hot. I feel so drawn to you somehow...\" It came slower with Rephaim and Stevie Rae but that's what made it seem like something was actually there. They made each other better people.Rephaim also gets a bad reputation because his daddy is the thousand year old serial murder/rapist Zoey had a thing for, and he's done some killing himself. Maybe raping, I don't know. What makes it different for me is that Kalona chose to become the way he was; Rephaim was raised into it. Once he started realizing what light was compared to darkness and what it really meant to love and be loved, once he realized he could possibly change he actually wanted to. And he did. That was part of what made his story with Stevie Rae so great to me. Kalona was a story of falling from grace; Rephaim was a story of redemption.If there's anything I don't regret about reading this series, it would be the relationship between this Raven Mocker and Red Vampyre. Bird Boy and Okie. They were a very lovely and interesting development.But even their relationship alone can't hold me anymore. I loved the outcome even though I found him to be a bit whipped in this book. I was very touched by Kalona's decision but really none of this can make up for the declining plot and crappy characters.Diving deeper into that: What is with this language??? The Cast team try so hard to sound like teenagers and they fail so hard it embarrasses me to evenbea teenager. Supposedly P.C Cast was a high school English teacher and that's where she got her material from. I have never, in my life, heard anyone speak with such idiocy. There's a lot of valley girl slang and fabricated words and I haven't heard either since late elementary to early middle school. Though I will admit, I have a friend who's a few years older than I and he does recognize some of the lingo... from the 90's. The phrases and words used in this book have no business in 2007 and beyond. I also heard that P.C writes and Kristin goes in and \"teen-ifys\" it. Well Kristin...STOP IT!Just...Just stop it!Who says \"hee-hee's\"? WHO??? And another thing about Zoey... what's with a 17 year old girl using the word \"poopie\"??? I hate that word. I cannot stand that word. From toddler to tween, my younger sister used that word as a substitute for almost every adjective available. My mom, my dad, and myself all tried to train her out of it because we're just so sick of hearing it. There's just no one who would actually make that word a part of their daily vocabulary. I get that this is supposed to be some kind of endearing character quirk of hers... it's not.There were a lot of problems with the writing. I'm not going to bother getting into them all. I will say there were a lot of inconsistencies. The only one that immediately comes to mind happens to be in this book. It's when Stevie Rae drove Zoey's car.... the car that was stolen at the end of the last book. There was no explanation of how it got back. No hint it had ever been gone. It was just... there. Also had problems with all the pop culture references! These can be fun IN MINIMUM but this series is so stuffed full of Glee and Trueblood you'd think they were being paid to advertise. Heck, there's a scene inDestineddedicated to a not-so-subtle advertisement of the Sookie Stackhouse series. One that could only logically be completed with a cheesy grin and thumbs up at the camera.And just... ugh... There's nothing for me anymore. I couldn't even get 40 pages intoDestinedbefore I closed the book, put my head in my hands, and wondered why I was wasting my life. I could barely even gather the energy to read that far and it's safe to say I will never pick it up again. I've even lost the fire to continue with this review/rant. I don't blame anyone for liking this series because I was oddly addicted to it for some time as well. But seriously: I'm tired of the plot, I hate the main character, I'm sick of her twisted love life, and I'm saddened by herfellow twitsfriends. There is nothing for me. I quit. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

I felt duped and angry with how the series had progressed. What looked to be shaping into an exciting and memorable series has turned into a series that I will not finish.Plot summaryOur intrepid female hero from the first book, has struck out on her own after the events at the end of Clan of the Cave Bear. Ayla is forced to use all of the knowledge she has gained over the course of her short life to eek out an existence on her own. In a parallel story, we are introduced to Jondular, a male from the \"others\", as he and his younger brother set out on a journey of self discovery.The GoodDespite this book, Ayla is one of most memorable characters from any book I have read. She is plucky, smart and resourceful in an environment that does not understand these traits. Up until the storylines converge, Ayla's story was interesting. I enjoyed reading about her and I felt invested in her wellbeing after the first novel. This is the only reason the book avoided a one star rating and the only reason that I read the book until the end. Had the story simply focused on her and her fight for survival, the book may have been a 4 star read.The BadJondular.Seriously, I could not stand the character. In Jondular, we have a 21 year old man without a mate and without a purpose in life. He cannot commit to a woman, loves to make tools but his true calling in life is giving women their \"Pleasure\" (yes, it is supposed to be capitalized) with his organ/manhood/woman-maker. Seriously, at one point a wise Shaman type woman tells him that some people have the gift of making boats, or hunting or carving but he has the gift of pleasuring woman and he should not despise this. I was ready to stab myself in the eyes at this point. This guy was so torn up by the fact that he could make a woman happy in bed but no woman could make him happy in his heart..............I didn't care.The tone of the story was far more modern. The speech, attidudes and actions of the characters would not have been out of place had the story been of a few people trying to win the game of Survivor. While the first book did a masterful job of making the reader feel as if they were in an ancient and unknown time, this book lost the mystical quality.While Ayla's inventiveness was endearing in the first book, it seemed in the second book as if Ayla wsa to be the inventor of every great discovery of prehistoric man. In chapter after chapter she was disovering or improving on the tools and materials of the her world.

Books focusing on the love and relationship between two characters does not interest me. Like many historical fiction novels, this falls into the trap of simply trying to convince us that love is the tie that binds the eras together. As the first book was not written with romance and relationship as a major plotline, it was disappointing that this book changed direction.Finally, the storytelling was lazy. In the first book, we were able to watch Ayla learn and grow. When she was adopted by the Neanderthals, she had to learn their way of life, their custom and their unique language. In this book, Ayla is faced with similar circumstance but the author cheats us by cutting corners. For example,Ayla was learning spoken language from Jondular. Her speech was rough and her understanding was incomplete but she was trying and learning quickly. She could vaguely recall speaking as a 5 year old but it was not more than a fleeting memory. After having a dream about her initial cave lion attack and a dream about her parents, she suddenly recalls how to speak and she has not issues with language and understating language.It was dizzying how quickly this series became unpalpable. It was a huge disappointment after the first book.

That being said, even if I had gone in with correct expectations, I doubt my opinions would have changed all that much.Let's start with my first problem: NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK. Well, ok, that's not completely true, there is a lot of plot progression and activity in the last 100 or so pages of the book. But the effort needed to get to that point was really taxing. Yes the writing is very pretty. And yes the magic system is incredibly inventive. And yes the atmosphere is enticing but without a strong cohesive narrative tying it all together there's just nothing for me to latch on to. I kept reading and waiting for the plot to go somewhere but ultimately it never did. But a lack of a plot doesn't inherently mean a book is bad right? A lot of people don't mind reading a \"no plot, just vibes\" book if the characters are compelling. So, are they compelling? Well...The characters (and the world as a whole) just lacked any complexity or depth. I actually laughed when I saw a review that saidBabelhas \"a brilliant presentation of the found family trope\". That's completely wrong. These characters are not a found family. A found family indicates a level of trust, rapport, and devotion. Here, the characters keep things from each other, they never listen to one another, and every time we do see them talking to each other it always devolves into an argument.But by far the biggest issue here was Letty. At no point did she feel like a real person. It was SO EVIDENT that she was just a mouthpiece for the author to get her beliefs across. She's a woman which means she has some struggles in academia, but she's white which means she avoids the struggles that non white women face (so you can tell that the author has heard of the word intersectionality). She uses her experiences with sexism to guilt trip others into accepting her demands but also isn't aware of the privilege she has. The narrative CONSTANTLY tells us that she's a racist and an ignoramus but it never actually shows her doing any of these things, which makes it extremely jarring when others accuse her of being bigoted, since there was no build up to it.This is just the gist of the description and not an actual quote, but in one moment she would be described as \"someone who makes a few off hand comments here and there but ultimately a kind soul\" and then a hundred pages later Victoire and Ramy would be screaming at her about how she was unaware of their struggles with racism.She was also just a weird character in general, at one point she discovers the others have been keeping a HUGE secret from her and I expected there to be some big blowout and argument... But instead she just doesn't say anything and immediately forgives them. If I learned that my close friends we're keeping such a secret from me, I would've said goodbye and broken all contact with them. On a pure narrative level, I can kinda understand Letty's actions and beliefs but I ultimately can't fully appreciate them because it wassoevident what the author was trying to do and I couldn't read about her without feeling like R. F. Kuang was breathing down my neck.In fact this is a big issue with all the characters in general, it felt like they were written around a single defining characteristic rather than being given space for something more. Here are all the characters summed up: Robin is the one who struggles with his biracial identity, Ramy is the one who hates the British, Victoire is the one who suffers so we can see the cruelty of colonialism, Letty is the one who's a privileged white woman and Lovell is the one who's a racist AND a hypocrite. They're never given any dimension outside of this one attribute and it just starts to wear you down.With regard to the world, there was, once again, a complete lack of any kind of nuance or complexity. Without (trying to) spoil much, there is a war about to happen between two countries and all the people in the aggressor country are portrayed as evil, heartless, and cruel, while all the people in the victim country are shown as innocent, virtuous, and pure. I'm not saying that all countries are heartless or all countries are good, what I'm saying is that such a simple dichotomy does not make for a rewarding reading experience. To elaborate:While I was readingBabel, I was comparing it a lot toFlamefall(which is the second book in The Aurelian Cycle Trilogy) by Rosaria Munda since both deal with themes of inequality, revolution, and war. And honestly if you want an example of these themes handled well go readFlamefallinstead (but obviously read Fireborne first lol). I'm just gonna say it hereBabelwas just a less interesting and less compelling version ofFlamefall.Like inBabel, there's also a colonial empire antagonist inFlamefalltoo, and it would have been so easy for the author to depict everyone under that regime as cruel and evil. But instead we actually see the day to day lives of ordinary people under that regime, how many people have different thoughts and beliefs and ideals and stakes. In addition we are also shown the lives of people under the \"innocent\" country and how the government and its people constantly make mistakes and errors and poor choices. This made for such a richer reading experience because we are shown the full stakes and complex actions of everyone involved, whereas inBabel, there exists no such complexity. And yes, I know there were a few moments (in the end where everything was crammed in) where the characters began to question their actions, but that ultimately lead to nowhere.The conclusive message ofBabelbasically seems to be \"white people bad, everything sucks, and then you die\" (which is honestly most of literary fiction in general lmao) and that's fine I guess.

            "Translation failed for: Right, so… this really wasn’t the book for me. Oh dear, I have a lot of issues, but remember: if you loved this book, that’s valid, but you didn’t, it doesn’t mean you aren’t “intelligent enough”. To be honest, after reading that, I’ve become convinced more than ever that people rate a book highly purely based on the fact it covers important topics to avoid “looking racist” rather than actually rating how a book handles and discusses racism and incredibly important discussions such as capitalism, colonialism and its long-standing, horrific impact.Had this book been marketed as a YA, I would have been more forgiving. The deep topics covered (linguistics, academia, colonialism, racism, capitalism) are discussed in an overly simplistic, patronising way that talks down to the reader. (Us poor non-Oxbridge types are clearly too uneducated to formulate our own readings of any imagery, and can’t possibly understand complex ideas. Here, let the author ensure you understand it by emphatically overemphasising the obvious in the narrative and adding footnotes to boot, just in case even that’s too difficult for you to understand).There are several issues of note, primarily the bombardment of themes and topics which all exist at a superficial level, and none are covered well. Let’s break them down:1. Racial stereotyping and cartoonish presentation of microagressions.Racism is rarely subtle, especially during this period. There’s no need to question the overt nature of racism, but the way it’s presented is rather cartoonish. As someone who doesn’t experience racism, I can’t really speak on the matter in terms of realisticness, but as a reader, from my perspective, the overt racism and micro aggressions were presented in an almost comical manner which undermined the emotional intensity of the experiences of the character subjected to it. It read like a book introducing children to the subject of racism and how to identify it in very overt way rather than an adult discussing the impacts of racism and how atrocious, insidious microagressions affect academics in elitist institutions and beyond.On top of this, the one-dimensional, stereotyped characters seemed to undermine the anti-racist sentiments. These interesting figures were reduced to their identities complete with racial stereotypes, making them feel like props being used to express the author’s message rather than existing as characters in their right, whose existence inadvertently raises awareness to important topics of discussion. The characters had no complexity or depth, and the relationships between them weren’t developed or explored: they just were. I felt like they were used as a checkbox for diversity or mouthpieces rather than existing in their own right, and that, again, felt hypocritical considering the plot of the book.I mean, you can’t criticise racism and then reduce all your characters to caricatures of their racial and social stereotypes. I mean, come on — you made the Irish girl THROW A POTATO AT SOMEONE for crying out loud. Good grief.2. Hypocritical and overly simplistic discussion on linguistics.For a book about language and the importance of its impact, there’s a bizarrely hypocritical employment of it. It doesn’t make sense to write a historical novel about language if you then employ politically contemporary language to develop your characters’ identities, and how they self-identify. Why make it a historical novel at all if you disregard the language limitations of the period? Why write about the nuances and inadequacies of language within a historical period if you ignore all the limitations of language during that period and instead have your characters understand race and discussions about race and identity with language that’s only come into existence in the past 50 years?The ultra-contemporary political language concerning, and understanding of, race, colonialism, imperialism, class, wealth, oppression etc weren’t authentic to that period, and this doesn’t make sense because there were activists and academics writing about these issues during this period and they do so in their own language and lexicon. Why do so much research into this period only to disregard the language of that period, especially when you’re writing a book about language and the magic system revolves around language?!Additionally, I’m not a linguist or translator, but the discussions on linguistics, etymology, translation, etc seemed incredibly basic to me, which added to the feeling of being perpetually patronised by the author.3. An undeveloped magic system under a thinly veiled metaphorThe magic system was so original in nature yet failed miserably in execution. I think people really underestimate how difficult magic systems are to create: they think they can just throw in magic and that’s all that’s necessary. Don’t get me wrong, Kuang can write when she actually does it, but rather than write a scene, Kuang chooses to summarise it, and the same goes for her magic system. I really dislike books which tell, not show, and this whole book is written in this way, and the same law applies to its magic system.The book is straddling two genres- history and fantasy. Its history is fine, nothing outstanding or worthy of praise, but you would expect adding magic to this period would change it in some meaningful way. But it doesn’tI’m not entirely sure how this benefitted from being a fantasy. Everything about this period is the same despite these being magic at their disposal. The magic in this book has the same impact on the society and period as a pink lady apple. Imagine someone writing a historical fiction about the 19th century with a magical element about it - a pink lady apple. This is impossible, pink lady apples weren’t invented until 1973. But this author decides to include it as an essential part of the plot. Yep. As you’d imagine, that wouldn’t have much impact, and the magic in this book has the same degree of impact.If the world isn’t fundamentally changed by silver, why are we supposed to care? I’m not excited about silver, like I wouldn’t be exited about a pink lady apple being in the book. If it doesn’t transform the world as we know it, how are we supposed to invest in this universe and care about the fate of silver?I really felt Kuang doubted the ability of their readers to understand literature and read metaphors. They were so heavy-handed with spelling out that the magic system of silver was a metaphor for the industrial revolution I felt like I was reading the Spark notes to a novel rather than a novel itself. It’s ok, Kuang. You can let the reader take the book into their own hands. She seemed to be terrified at the idea of a reader not acknowledging or picking up on every “ingenious” literary technique she employed that she forced us to acknowledge every essence of it. This would be the easiest book for a literature student to analyse, because the author gave us all the answers. She needs to trust the reader’s intelligence, and she needs to let go of the idea that literature can be read in ways she never intended it to be.4. Preachy mouthpieces that don’t fit the characters or time periodOk, so we’ve covered the fact that Kuang uses inaccurate political language regarding race and social status for this period of time (and the characters have an awareness of these issues in a language which is unbefitting to the period). But Oh GOD, the Opium debate. This is probably where I got the most irritated. No offence to Gen Z, but there’s a stereotype of your generation for being preachy know-it-all/experts in every possible situation, and this scene really fell into that stereotype (I don’t agree with this stereotype of you, by the way, I’m just using the stereotype as an example so you can picture this scene).In this scene, Robin, the naive, sheltered little translation student suddenly, out of no where, becomes an expert in the health and social implications of Opium and it’s the most staged, preachy, inauthentic and random scene that it stood out like a sore thumb. I don’t disagree with anything he said, but it felt totally contrived and moralistic (superior know-it-all student knows all about a random subject unrelated to anything he’s discussed in the book so far against very overtly greedy, selfish evil British man - it was cartoonish). By the end of the scene, I expected the other guy to snap his fingers at Robin and scream “YAHS QUEEN”. It felt like I was reading a debate on Twitter where someone was perfectly citing facts they googled quickly to back up their position, posing as an expert despite clearly knowing nothing about the subject until a very superficial understanding of it.This discussion is so important. In fact, this book covers such important discussions and topics, but they’re presented in such a lazy way that they might as well have been blog posts on the issue rather than plopped into a work of fiction. This kind of event occurred several times throughout the book, but this was the most heavy-handed and extensive and it stuck out to me, haunting me all the way to the point I wrote this darn review.There was nothing clever about how these important issues were discussed and raised. It was boring and straight forward, as if catering to young adults learning about life issues for the first time rather than adults. People criticising the book saying “it reads like a textbook/academic article) are being FAR too complimentary — the most important elements are written like a blog post.5. On a personal note, I’m rather fed up of the glorification of Oxbridge universities. They’ve been historically heralded as the pinnacle of academic prestige, despite centuries of nepotism and upper-class biases underlying their admittance process (which is, ironically, highlighted in the book). Academics exist all over the world in a wealth of institutions. Can we stop this overdone trope of the ivory towers, please? I’m bored., error: Right, so… this really wasn’t the book for me. Oh dear, I have a lot of issues, but remember: if you loved this book, that’s valid, but you didn’t, it doesn’t mean you aren’t “intelligent enough”. To be honest, after reading that, I’ve become convinced more than ever that people rate a book highly purely based on the fact it covers important topics to avoid “looking racist” rather than actually rating how a book handles and discusses racism and incredibly important discussions such as capitalism, colonialism and its long-standing, horrific impact.Had this book been marketed as a YA, I would have been more forgiving. The deep topics covered (linguistics, academia, colonialism, racism, capitalism) are discussed in an overly simplistic, patronising way that talks down to the reader. (Us poor non-Oxbridge types are clearly too uneducated to formulate our own readings of any imagery, and can’t possibly understand complex ideas. Here, let the author ensure you understand it by emphatically overemphasising the obvious in the narrative and adding footnotes to boot, just in case even that’s too difficult for you to understand).There are several issues of note, primarily the bombardment of themes and topics which all exist at a superficial level, and none are covered well. Let’s break them down:1. Racial stereotyping and cartoonish presentation of microagressions.Racism is rarely subtle, especially during this period. There’s no need to question the overt nature of racism, but the way it’s presented is rather cartoonish. As someone who doesn’t experience racism, I can’t really speak on the matter in terms of realisticness, but as a reader, from my perspective, the overt racism and micro aggressions were presented in an almost comical manner which undermined the emotional intensity of the experiences of the character subjected to it. It read like a book introducing children to the subject of racism and how to identify it in very overt way rather than an adult discussing the impacts of racism and how atrocious, insidious microagressions affect academics in elitist institutions and beyond.On top of this, the one-dimensional, stereotyped characters seemed to undermine the anti-racist sentiments. These interesting figures were reduced to their identities complete with racial stereotypes, making them feel like props being used to express the author’s message rather than existing as characters in their right, whose existence inadvertently raises awareness to important topics of discussion. The characters had no complexity or depth, and the relationships between them weren’t developed or explored: they just were. I felt like they were used as a checkbox for diversity or mouthpieces rather than existing in their own right, and that, again, felt hypocritical considering the plot of the book.I mean, you can’t criticise racism and then reduce all your characters to caricatures of their racial and social stereotypes. I mean, come on — you made the Irish girl THROW A POTATO AT SOMEONE for crying out loud. Good grief.2. Hypocritical and overly simplistic discussion on linguistics.For a book about language and the importance of its impact, there’s a bizarrely hypocritical employment of it. It doesn’t make sense to write a historical novel about language if you then employ politically contemporary language to develop your characters’ identities, and how they self-identify. Why make it a historical novel at all if you disregard the language limitations of the period? Why write about the nuances and inadequacies of language within a historical period if you ignore all the limitations of language during that period and instead have your characters understand race and discussions about race and identity with language that’s only come into existence in the past 50 years?The ultra-contemporary political language concerning, and understanding of, race, colonialism, imperialism, class, wealth, oppression etc weren’t authentic to that period, and this doesn’t make sense because there were activists and academics writing about these issues during this period and they do so in their own language and lexicon. Why do so much research into this period only to disregard the language of that period, especially when you’re writing a book about language and the magic system revolves around language?!Additionally, I’m not a linguist or translator, but the discussions on linguistics, etymology, translation, etc seemed incredibly basic to me, which added to the feeling of being perpetually patronised by the author.3. An undeveloped magic system under a thinly veiled metaphorThe magic system was so original in nature yet failed miserably in execution. I think people really underestimate how difficult magic systems are to create: they think they can just throw in magic and that’s all that’s necessary. Don’t get me wrong, Kuang can write when she actually does it, but rather than write a scene, Kuang chooses to summarise it, and the same goes for her magic system. I really dislike books which tell, not show, and this whole book is written in this way, and the same law applies to its magic system.The book is straddling two genres- history and fantasy. Its history is fine, nothing outstanding or worthy of praise, but you would expect adding magic to this period would change it in some meaningful way. But it doesn’tI’m not entirely sure how this benefitted from being a fantasy. Everything about this period is the same despite these being magic at their disposal. The magic in this book has the same impact on the society and period as a pink lady apple. Imagine someone writing a historical fiction about the 19th century with a magical element about it - a pink lady apple. This is impossible, pink lady apples weren’t invented until 1973. But this author decides to include it as an essential part of the plot. Yep. As you’d imagine, that wouldn’t have much impact, and the magic in this book has the same degree of impact.If the world isn’t fundamentally changed by silver, why are we supposed to care? I’m not excited about silver, like I wouldn’t be exited about a pink lady apple being in the book. If it doesn’t transform the world as we know it, how are we supposed to invest in this universe and care about the fate of silver?I really felt Kuang doubted the ability of their readers to understand literature and read metaphors.

            "Translation failed for: Goddammit. I wanted to like this one. I really, really, really did. It has a lot going for it.Midnight Riot, also known asRivers of Londonacross the pond, has, while not the most original premise, certainly an engaging voice. It's got that dry British humor going on, an initially likable hero, an intriguing world and diverse cast, a science(ish)-based magic system, and a POC protagonist who doesn't read like a white guy with a paint job. It was close, SO CLOSE, to enjoyable.Unfortunately, it's first and foremost a blatant male wish-fulfillment fantasy, which I could have endured, if the female characters hadn't ended up a casualty of the male-centric plot.Midnight Riotis heavy on the sexism: sometimes subtle, sometimes...not so much, but present and grating enough to make it a problem for me.Sigh.But let's talk about the good things first for once, eh?Four Things ILikedAboutMidnight Riot:1. It's FunnyAaronovitch knows his stuff.Midnight Riottends towards dry and subversive humor, and Aaronovitch is very good at using characters and archetypes familiar to the genre in funny and unexpected ways. The dialog is, for the most part, sharp and conversations have the sort of timing you'd expect from someone with a history of penning witty television shows.Riotand its world and its characters have the feel of a slightly wacky, weekly supernatural police procedural, and I could easily see it working as one.Not every joke works, of course, but more than anything else the deadpan tone of the novel kept me reading and interested, even through two seriously meandering, disconnected plots, and an often history-heavy narrative.2. It Has a Truly Diverse CastMidnight Riotwas one of the few books with a POC protagonist where I feel like the author didn't just label a white protagonist black or Asian or Native American and been done with it. Peter's race actively impacts his life and his experiences - the way people react to him on the subway, or during a riot, or even in his job, he is aware of how his skin color makes a difference. It's not heavy-handed or preachy or the point of the story, it's just an aspect of Peter's life, and I think Aaronovitch handled that aspect quite well.There's also a higher-than-average number of characters of color, in general. Dr. Walid, the coroner, is Scottish Muslim, and Peter's mother, of course, is an immigrant from Sierra Leon. His love interest, Beverly Brook, the powerful Mama Thames, and the majority of the rivers of London are African women. They all seem to largely avoid stereotypes, though I find the success of Bev and Mama Thames' portrayal a little sketchier - but that has more to do with the treatment of their genders than their race.3. The Magic System is Really, Really CoolI'm not one to give a shit about this sort of thing, usually, butMidnight Riot's science-based magic system caught my fancy. Peter is actually surprisingly inquisitive after he's chosen to begin training as a wizard, and doesn't let the revelation of magic and monsters and ghosts shake his confidence in the laws of science and nature that make up his understanding of the world. Like a hero after my own heart, Peter doesn't just accept that magic works \"because magic\". Instead, he immediately begins applying the laws of physics tothem.Peter questions. He experiments. He formulates theories, and then he tests them, and through his reasoning, we get a basic understanding of how magic works, in more scientific terms than usual. Magical spells are discussed in terms of joules and newtons; conservation of mass, energy, the laws of thermodynamics - they all apply. It's not all hand-waving and mystical force - the magic has consequences.One memorable example is when Peter runs a series of experiments to discover why casting spells results in the destruction of nearby electronics - including his cell phone. After a series of tests, he is not only able to give a reasonable explanation as for why, but also figures out how far the sphere of damage extends, and how to avoid it all together. It's neat stuff.Granted, SCIENCE! can only go so far in explaining supernatural phenomenon, and there comes a time when both Peter and his teacher have to admit that they just don't know how some magic works, scientifically, but there was enough detail that I didn't really mind when we got to that point. What I liked was that the magic was limited; it has rules, it requires repeated practice and study and patience, so Peter can't just whip out a wand and deus ex machina his way through the book with some random badass spell ten levels above his proficiency (though, of course, this doesn't prevent other magical deities from deus ex-ing to their heart's content).The point is, the system more firmly grounds Peter Grant's world in reality than most any other urban fantasy series I've come across. It's well thought-out and detailed, and I appreciate that.4. Peter Grant Has the Potential to be a Cool CharacterI'm of two minds about Peter. On the one hand, I wanted to like him. He's not a dick-head Alpha male convinced he knows better than everyone else. He's actually got an underdog feel: he's not quite attentive enough to be a good police officer, he's best friends with a woman he desperately wants to date, and he's destined for a life of paperwork, until the ghost shows up. He commits to studying magic, but he's still got to practice like anyone else, and he makes plenty of dumb mistakes on the long road to solving the book's mystery. He's just kind of an average guy.So what's the problem? Well, I mean, did you read that last paragraph? Every last bit of that makes Peter a perfect nerd wish-fulfilment insert. He's the meek, ignored, everyday beta-male who ischosen by fateto become the hero, who gets the super-sweet magician's apprentice gig instead of the mundane paper-pushing desk job he dreaded, who saves the day and gets the hot girlfriend and shows all those doubters what's what.One Thing that Utterly KilledMidnight Riotfor MeMisogyny!Given the over-saturation of male wish-fulfillment characters in the general media, this kind of story isn't for everyone, but I really could have gotten past that, if,if, the women hadn't been so completely filtered through this lens.

            "Translation failed for: The spell is broken. You guys know how much I loved the first book in this series but its sequels annoy and bore the shit outta me. I loved Anne as a character in the first book because she has flaws, gets into silly scraps and has so much to learn. In Book 2 and 3, she is just insufferable. She has become such a Mary Sue. Everything comes natural and easy for her, every-fucking-body worships and loves her, every man she interacts with proposes to her, everyone wants to be her friend, she's everyone's favorite, she's the best in college, she's a gifted writer, her looks are captivating ... yada yada yada. I can't take it anymore.To give you some examples of Montgomery's ridiculous heroisation of Anne: I shit you not that every fucking character loves Anne the best out of all people. \"Phil adored Anne and Priscilla, but especially Anne.\" Ruby tells Anne on her fucking deathbed (she's dying of consumption) that she always liked her the best out of all of her school chums. When Charlotta the Fourth returns from Boston, she tells Anne: \"I haven't seen anyone in Boston that's equal to you.\" Anne is such a special snowflake that even Rusty, the cat, who usually hates all (!) people, LOVES Anne. I cannot deal with tomfoolery like this. I am done.On top of that, Montgomery's writing feels much more (out-)dated in Book 2 and 3 than it did in the first book. All of a sudden she has become this hyper-Christian and moralising writer. Her work reads more like Christian propaganda, and I found it insufferable. Anne has become so moralising and patronising herself, I could literally picture Montgomery sitting at her desk thinking to herself how well she did with infusing her (Christian) lessons and values into her young readers. Big yikes. Book 2 and 3 read as if Montgomery was writing a pamphlet on how a proper woman (aka wife) should be.“Phil, you're not really frivolous,” said Anne gravely. “Way down underneath that frivolous exterior of yours you've got a dear, loyal, womanly little soul.”Does that sound like the fun little girl we all came to love in the first book to you? Anne, what the hell? What has happened to you? Oh yeah, you had to grow up. Ugh.Apart from Phil (WHO IS TRULY ICONIC) I also didn't enjoy any of the new characters. To give you some examples of Phil's iconic behaviour, here are some of her outlooks on life/being a woman: \"I really hated the thought of being married for a few years yet. I want to have heaps of fun before I settle down.\" (as you should!) and \"Being in love makes you a perfect slave, I think. And it would give a man such a power to hurt you.\" (she sure knows what's up!). The reason why I liked Phil so much is that she felt how Anne felt in the first book. Fun, independent, iconic. Funnily enough, I loved her romance with Jonas Blake (\"It is impossible—but I'm horribly afraid it's true. I'm happy and wretched and scared. He can never care for me, I know.\") a lot more than the shenanigans of Anne and Gilbert.One thing I cannot excuse, however, is when the girls try to chloroform Rusty the cat and it's all played for shits and giggles, as if that's not animal torture and a literal crime?? I was so confused.I hated how Anne let Roy Gardner on. He truly deserved better but he was a useless character bc it was clear from the start that Anne would end up with Gilbert. Didn't care for Miss Lavendar and Davy in Book 2, so no surprise that I didn't warm to them in this one. There's decidedly too little of Diana Barry in this book. And Rachel and Marilla are still my faves (I love that they are flat mates now!) but I also would've loved to see more of them. Their scenes were the best!The last chapter was sickly sweet but it fuelled me with some energy. Gilbert is decidedly too good for Anne (\"I asked you a question over two years ago, Anne. If I ask it again today will you give me a different answer.\") but I am happy that they ended up together. Nonetheless, I was quite bored that the two of them were basically serving Laurie & Jo throughout this entire book (with Gilbert's first proposal and Anne's rejection of him etc.). Like, we get it. And it got so much worse when Anne only realised that she loved Gilbert when he was literally dying of an illness. Like, bestie, wake up? Where have you been for the last five years? You cannot tell me that Anne didn't have an inkling before, it is so clear that she was in love with Gilbert from the very start.However, I hate that Montgomery basically insinuates that it is a woman's place to get married and have children. Diana gives birth to her first child, and Jane Andrews marries a Winnipeg millionaire. I feel like it would've been the bolder choice to have at least Gilbert move on to marry Christine and have Anne ending up on her own (... not permanently, but at least for the time being of Book 3 and 4). All in all, I feel like the gang grew up way too fucking fast. I'll forever cherish Book 1 and their childhood merriments, but basically straight up beginning with Book 2 it was \"you're an adult woman now, so get it together and find a husband now\". I'm not saying that that wasn't the reality for most women of Montgomery's time but Book 1 felt so progressive and daring, whereas the rest of the series is so mainstream/run-of-the-mill and tame.

He can never care for me, I know.\") a lot more than the shenanigans of Anne and Gilbert.One thing I cannot excuse, however, is when the girls try to chloroform Rusty the cat and it's all played for shits and giggles, as if that's not animal torture and a literal crime?? I was so confused.I hated how Anne let Roy Gardner on. He truly deserved better but he was a useless character bc it was clear from the start that Anne would end up with Gilbert. Didn't care for Miss Lavendar and Davy in Book 2, so no surprise that I didn't warm to them in this one. There's decidedly too little of Diana Barry in this book. And Rachel and Marilla are still my faves (I love that they are flat mates now!) but I also would've loved to see more of them. Their scenes were the best!The last chapter was sickly sweet but it fuelled me with some energy. Gilbert is decidedly too good for Anne (\"I asked you a question over two years ago, Anne. If I ask it again today will you give me a different answer.\") but I am happy that they ended up together. Nonetheless, I was quite bored that the two of them were basically serving Laurie & Jo throughout this entire book (with Gilbert's first proposal and Anne's rejection of him etc.). Like, we get it. And it got so much worse when Anne only realised that she loved Gilbert when he was literally dying of an illness. Like, bestie, wake up? Where have you been for the last five years? You cannot tell me that Anne didn't have an inkling before, it is so clear that she was in love with Gilbert from the very start.However, I hate that Montgomery basically insinuates that it is a woman's place to get married and have children. Diana gives birth to her first child, and Jane Andrews marries a Winnipeg millionaire. I feel like it would've been the bolder choice to have at least Gilbert move on to marry Christine and have Anne ending up on her own (... not permanently, but at least for the time being of Book 3 and 4). All in all, I feel like the gang grew up way too fucking fast. I'll forever cherish Book 1 and their childhood merriments, but basically straight up beginning with Book 2 it was \"you're an adult woman now, so get it together and find a husband now\". I'm not saying that that wasn't the reality for most women of Montgomery's time but Book 1 felt so progressive and daring, whereas the rest of the series is so mainstream/run-of-the-mill and tame. I'm afraid Anne has lost her charm. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: Beware of spoilers!What a complete disappointment compared to the utter bliss I felt from the first one. Meghan is the reason why I gave this book a two! I shall proceed to have my fangirl moments and my complaints now:Fangirl moments:1. You see, the first 114 pages were decent. However, I must say I had a deep longing to see my Puck! I couldn't stand it. I did not laugh or giggle once throughout the beginning, considering that Prince Ash is an absolute bore.When Puck finally made his grand entrance as a raven on page 115, I shrieked and proceeded to do my happy dance. Finally, some action and humor!2. I also had my fangirl moment when Puck and Meghan kissed. It wasn't awkward! Well, if you completely disregarded the fact that Grimalkin claimed that they were humping like rabbits on the bed. Besides that, I thought it was sweet. Before that, I was utterly furious at Meghan for romantically turning to Puck after being turned down by Ash. I wanted to strangle her with her own hair and dump her into a river. She's so unbelievably selfish when it comes to Puck andonlyPuck. All she--- Okay. I apologize. This is my fangirl section. I shall continue about this later. See how hard it is for me just to fangirl without having my complaints spill out of me?3. Ironhorse! I absolutely loved him!Complaints:1. Meghan's obsession over Ash: Besides Puck's heartbreaking absence in the first 114 pages, I was completely annoyed by Meghan's constant, \"Where is Ash? The Winter Prince stole my heart. I loved him. Where is Ash? Knives stabbed my heart as I watched him walk away. I love him! I couldn't stop thinking about him.\" Ash this. Ash that. Ash. Ash. Ash. \"I turned to see if Ash was there or not. I turned to see if Ash was waiting for me or not.\"Ido notneed to read about your constant:How long have they known each other?2. The whole \"I'm treating you like horse crap because I have to, not because I want to\" concept is very exhausting. Seen it before over and over again. And Meghan crying over him and believing that Ash's love for her was false and blah, blah, freaking, blah. He treats her like crap and she cries over it instead of telling him off. That is one of the reasons why I do not want Ash and Meghan as a couple. Besides the fact that they bore me to sleep with their \"chemistry\", they are just not right for each other.\"We cannot be together. Stay away from me. There are too many barriers.\" shamefully =3. Ash isclearlystill in love with Ariella. He thinks about her everyday of his life. He compares her to Meghan. He keeps her personal items with her. He is a destroyed prince who is \"in love\" with a half-breed only becomes she slightly reminds him of his old love. And of course Meghan is absolutely fine with that because she's head-over-heels with him. Idiocy.4. The love triangle. Why must there be a love triangle? I should have known this would happen, though. I was praying to myself that somehow Meghan would end up with Puck, because he's such an awesome beast that always made her laugh and made her comfortable. BUT NO.The love triangle = TWILIGHTMeghan turning to Puck because she's depressed over Ash = TWILIGHT5. Meghan sometimes befuddled me with her stupid remarks. One time, I just wanted to smack her across her head with my book.A conversation between Ironhorse and Meghan. This is after Ironhorse kills a pixie that was trying to rip Meghan's head off.\"You didn't have to kill it. It was like three inches tall!\"\"IT ATTACKED YOU. IT CLEARLY HAD AGGRESSIVE INTENT. MY MISSION IS TO PROTECT YOU UNTIL WE RETRIEVE THE SCEPTER. I WILL ALLOW NOTHING TO BRING YOU HARM. THAT IS MY SOLEMN VOW.\"\"Yeah, but you don't need a machine gun to kill a fly. Iron horse killed this teensy little faery---\"So when a knight dies, she's okay with it, but when a little pixie dies, she cries about it? Thank God Grimalkin was there to shout at her for being so stupid and ungrateful that such an enormous creature wanted to protect her. See, Meghan was decent in the first book. She wasn't stupid. Then Ash came along and flipped her brain upside down so that all her cells fell out.My secret hopes:1. Despite the fact that Meghan has now returned to her mortal world, I want a new faery to arrive and steal Puck's heart away. She could be anyone. I just want Puck to be with someone who makes Puck their first choice, not second! I just don't want Puck still pining for Meghan at the end of the series. He's Robin Goodfellow hello! Meghan can live happily ever after with her prince, but Puck needs someone better than Meghan.Someone like... Tiaothin! Eh, eh?They'd be awesome together! Although, we haven't seen much of her we can conclude that they're both mischievous, sly, and so beastly. I wonder if anyone else ships them? Phin! No, really. I want them together. Really. I'm Sirius Black.Overall, I am very disappoint, son. This is not how a sequel should be. I just wasn't as happy with this once as I was withThe Iron King., error: Uważaj na spoilery! Jakież to kompletne rozczarowanie w porównaniu do całkowitej błogości, którą poczułam po przeczytaniu pierwszej części. Meghan jest powodem, dla którego dałam tej książce ocenę dwa! Teraz przejdę do moich chwil fangirl i moich skarg:Momenty fangirl:1. Widzicie, pierwsze 114 stron było niezłe. Muszę jednak powiedzieć, że bardzo pragnęłam zobaczyć mojego Pucka! Nie mogłam tego znieść. Ani razu się nie zaśmiałam ani nie zachichotałam na początku, biorąc pod uwagę, że książę Ash jest absolutnym nudziarzem.Kiedy Puck w końcu wszedł jako kruk na stronie 115, wrzasnęłam i zaczęłam tańczyć swój taniec szczęścia. W końcu trochę akcji i humoru!2. Miałam też swój moment fangirl, kiedy Puck i Meghan się pocałowali. To nie było niezręczne! Cóż, jeśli całkowicie zignorujesz fakt, że Grimalkin twierdził, że uprawiali seks jak króliki na łóżku. Poza tym, myślałam, że to było słodkie. Przedtem byłam strasznie wściekła na Meghan za romantyczną zamianę z Puckiem po tym, jak Ash ją odrzucił. Miałam ochotę udusić ją jej własnymi włosami i wrzucić do rzeki. Jest tak niewiarygodnie samolubna, jeśli chodzi o Pucka i tylko Pucka. Wszystko, co ona... Okej. Przepraszam. To moja część fangirlingu. Kontynuuję później. Widzisz, jak trudno mi po prostu być fangirlingiem, nie pozwalając, by moje skargi wylały się ze mnie? 3. Ironhorse! Absolutnie go uwielbiałam! Skargi: 1. Obsesja Meghan na punkcie Asha: Oprócz rozdzierającej serce nieobecności Pucka na pierwszych 114 stronach, byłam całkowicie zirytowana ciągłym „Gdzie jest Ash? Zimowy Książę skradł moje serce. Kochałam go. Gdzie jest Ash? Noże wbijały mi się w serce, gdy patrzyłam, jak odchodzi. Kocham go! Nie mogłam przestać o nim myśleć”. Ash to. Ash tamto. Ash. Ash. Ash. „Odwróciłam się, żeby zobaczyć, czy Ash jest tam, czy nie. Odwróciłam się, żeby zobaczyć, czy Ash czeka na mnie, czy nie”. Nie muszę czytać o twoim ciągłym: Jak długo się znają? 2. Cała koncepcja „traktuję cię jak gówno, bo muszę, a nie dlatego, że chcę” jest bardzo wyczerpująca. Widziałam to już wcześniej, raz po raz. A Meghan płacze przez niego i wierzy, że miłość Asha do niej była fałszywa i bla, bla, cholera, bla. On traktuje ją jak gówno, a ona płacze przez to, zamiast mu to powiedzieć. To jeden z powodów, dla których nie chcę Asha i Meghan jako pary. Poza tym, że nudzą mnie do spania swoją „chemią”, po prostu nie pasują do siebie. „Nie możemy być razem. Trzymaj się ode mnie z daleka. Jest zbyt wiele barier”. haniebnie = 3. Ash jest wyraźnie nadal zakochany w Arielli. Myśli o niej każdego dnia swojego życia. Porównuje ją do Meghan. Trzyma przy sobie jej rzeczy osobiste. On jest zniszczonym księciem, który jest „zakochany” w mieszańcu, ale ona tylko trochę przypomina mu jego starą miłość. I oczywiście Meghan jest z tym absolutnie w porządku, ponieważ jest w nim po uszy. Idiotyzm.4. Trójkąt miłosny. Dlaczego musi istnieć trójkąt miłosny? Powinnam była wiedzieć, że tak się stanie. Modliłam się do siebie, żeby Meghan w jakiś sposób skończyła z Puckiem, ponieważ jest takim niesamowitym zwierzęciem, które zawsze ją rozśmieszało i sprawiało, że czuła się komfortowo. ALE NIE. Trójkąt miłosny = ZMIERZCHMeghan zwraca się do Pucka, ponieważ jest przygnębiona przez Asha = ZMIERZCH5. Meghan czasami wprawiała mnie w osłupienie swoimi głupimi uwagami. Pewnego razu chciałam po prostu uderzyć ją w głowę moją książką.Rozmowa między Ironhorse'em a Meghan. To jest po tym, jak Ironhorse zabija chochlika, który próbował oderwać głowę Meghan. „Nie musiałeś go zabijać. Miał jakieś trzy cale wzrostu!” „ZAATAKOWAŁ CIĘ. OCZYWIŚCIE MIAŁ AGRESYWNE ZAMIARY. MOJĄ MISJĄ JEST OCHRONA CIĘ, DOPÓKI NIE ODZYSKAMY BERŁA. NIE POZWOLĘ, ABY NIC CIĘ SKRZYWDZIŁO. TO MOJA UROCZYSTA PRZYSIĘGA”. „Tak, ale nie potrzebujesz karabinu maszynowego, żeby zabić muchę. Iron horse zabił tę malutką wróżkę---„Więc kiedy umiera rycerz, ona to akceptuje, ale kiedy umiera mała chochliczka, ona z tego powodu płacze? Dzięki Bogu Grimalkin był tam, żeby na nią nakrzyczeć za to, że jest taka głupia i niewdzięczna, że ​​tak ogromne stworzenie chciało ją chronić. Widzisz, Meghan była przyzwoita w pierwszej książce. Nie była głupia. Potem pojawił się Ash i wywrócił jej mózg do góry nogami, tak że wszystkie komórki wypadły.Moje sekretne nadzieje:1. Pomimo faktu, że Meghan wróciła do swojego śmiertelnego świata, chcę, aby przybyła nowa wróżka i ukradła serce Puck. Mogłaby być kimkolwiek. Chcę tylko, aby Puck była z kimś, kto sprawi, że Puck będzie jej pierwszym wyborem, a nie drugim! Po prostu nie chcę, aby Puck nadal tęsknił za Meghan pod koniec serii. To Robin Goodfellow, cześć! Meghan może żyć długo i szczęśliwie ze swoim księciem, ale Puck potrzebuje kogoś lepszego niż Meghan. Kogoś takiego jak... Tiaothin! Eh, eh?Byliby razem niesamowici! Chociaż nie widzieliśmy jej zbyt wiele, możemy wywnioskować, że oboje są psotni, chytrzy i tak bestialscy. Ciekawe, czy ktoś jeszcze ich shipuje? Phin! Nie, naprawdę. Chcę, żeby byli razem. Naprawdę. Jestem Syriuszem Blackiem.Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, jestem bardzo rozczarowany, synu. Tak nie powinien wyglądać sequel. Po prostu nie byłem z tego filmu tak zadowolony jak z „Iron Kinga”. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

Kagawa also frequently halts the action so she can insert some new twist, leading toscenes that feel forced and unnaturalin context (a day trip to a spa comes to mind - frankly, every scene with the new character, Lea, seems out of place).I can’t get over the fact that Meghan’s Winter Formal just happens to take place while they’re in the real world, allowing Ms. Social Outcast to attend with not one buttwoattractive boys.

            "Translation failed for: “One can live without friends, as one can live without love, or even without money…One can live in Paris – I discovered that! – on just grief and anguish…”-\tHenry Miller,Tropic of CancerGet yourself a gallon of milk. Wait until it has been expired for a month. Next, take that expired milk to Phoenix in July, and place it on an unshaded sidewalk. Leave it there for a week. Now, open up that jug and take a long, deep swallow.What you’ve just consumed has aged better than Henry Miller’sTropic of Cancer.The hero ofTropic of Canceris a pompous blowhard who manages, through sheer willpower, to display a streak of just about every prejudice that exists. He is a bit of a racist, a homophobe, an anti-Semite, and an agist. Towering above that all, though, is his truly extraordinary misogyny, which he displays by occasionally groping women, having sex with women who are unconscious, and referring to half the human population with a vulgar reference to their genitals (it rhymes with “runt,” if you must know).The kicker is that much of it is true, this being a semi-autobiographical novel.In a time in which sexual predators are being unmasked, prosecuted, and convicted, and in which toxic masculinity is being confronted with more vigor than perhaps ever before, it is an odd experience to read a book in which the protagonist not only presents himself as an anti-hero, but the coolest sort of anti-hero imaginable: the American expatriate in Paris.Here’s the thing, though. This was written in the 1930s, when Miller’s attitudes were not only prevalent, but probably bordered on conventional wisdom. It is offensive, yes, but it is not enough to simply be offended. Instead of trying to judge or justify across the span of nearly ninety years, I’m going to approach this book on its merits.On its merits, I foundTropic of Cancerto be sort of awful.***The controversy overTropic of Cancerhas, in a way, served as a distraction from its content. Published in France in 1934, the novel was long banned as obscene in America, due to its language and sexual references (both of which, in the fullness of time, feel rather tame today). The back cover of my 1987 paperback edition, which has been sitting on various bookshelves in various houses for years, has nothing to say about the actual substance of the book, and much to say about its role in the censorship laws of the United States. I always knew I wanted to readTropic of Cancer, if only because of its outré reputation. At the same time, I hesitated, since I had no idea what it was about.Now I know what it’s about. It’s mostly about nothing.The thinly fictionalized Miller ofTropic of Canceris a penniless mooch with wild delusions of grandeur, a writer working on a project to upend the world, which he humbly callsThe Last Book. Most of his time is spent dunning the people in his life – I hesitate to call them “characters” because they are really just names – for a fewcentimesto get a drink, to sleep with a prostitute, or both. Written in the first person, most of this book’s interminable three-hundred plus pages represents a repetition of this theme.This is an essentially plotless novel that skips through time, occasionally loses itself in long stream-of-conscious passages that might have wowed me in a different life – a life in which I was perpetually eighteen and an English major – and that somehow manages to make Paris seem like one of the ugliest, dreariest places on earth. People walk into and out of the story without leaving the faintest impression. There are a couple sex scenes, but mostly there is talk about sex, and most of this talk seems to consist of men telling each other lies.I am not a stranger to disturbing content. However, I want that content to be in service to the story. Because ofTropic of Cancer’s lack of a narrative through-line, however, I mostly found the nastiness here to be in service to itself. It represents the imperious preening of a man who has Raskolnikov’s sense of self-worth, Holden Caulfield’s whininess, and Harvey Weinstein’s view of women.***Leaving aside its dispiriting ingredients, I foundTropic of Cancerto be a bit of a slog. The nonlinearity makes it difficult to know where you are in time, and because you have no idea where anything is going, it takes forever to get there.Miller does provide some benchmarks – such as his job at a newspaper – that prove helpful in orienting yourself. More than that, Miller occasionally takes you through a lucid narrative arc, some of which are effective. Asked to say one nice thing aboutTropic of Cancer, I would say that the ending scenes of the novel, in which Miller helps a friend leave the country to escape a poisonous relationship, are pretty good. In presenting his closing thoughts, Miller writes of humankind:Human beings make a strange fauna and flora. From a distance they appear negligible; close up they are apt to appear ugly and malicious. More than anything they need to be surrounded with sufficient space – space even more than time.If nothing else, Miller certainly proves that thesis: that up close, humans are ugly and malicious.***The interesting thing about the manyTropic of Cancerreviews is that they appear to be in dialogue with each other. The people who love it are quite certain that the prose is genius (“This is not a book in the ordinary sense of the word. No, this is a prolonged insult, a gob of spit in the face of Art…”), the form is groundbreaking, and that any detractors are either squeamish pearl-clutching snowflakes, or are philistines who simply don’t get it. On the other hand, the people who hate it seem to find it morally reprehensible, that reprehensibility overwhelming all other facets. Then, there is some middle ground, with people who seemed to not like the book, but maybe don’t want to say it, becauseTropic of Cancer’s reputation is so exalted.In that spirit, I feel I should stake out my position. First, I should say I am not squeamish. I worked as a defense attorney for many years, interviewing people who’d done terrible things, viewing full color, high-resolution crime scene photos of murders, and generally forming an understanding of how bad it can get. To that end, no mere words – especially not the naughty-little-boy cursing ofTropic of Cancer– are going to dictate my reaction.Second, this is not a novel I didn’t “get.” I get that this is another in a long line of navel-gazing books by an author consumed by the purported tortures of writing. I get that Miller is trying to say something about the human condition, and that with himself as a standard, he finds the human condition to be precarious.There is also a scene in this all-time classic in which Miller goes to a brothel with a man from India, and this man defecates into a bidet, and there is a big hubbub about this. To repeat: in one ofTropic of Cancer’s rare set pieces, a man poops in a bidet.Igetit.***Not every book is for everyone.

Wait until it has been expired for a month. Next, take that expired milk to Phoenix in July, and place it on an unshaded sidewalk. Leave it there for a week. Now, open up that jug and take a long, deep swallow.What you’ve just consumed has aged better than Henry Miller’sTropic of Cancer.The hero ofTropic of Canceris a pompous blowhard who manages, through sheer willpower, to display a streak of just about every prejudice that exists. He is a bit of a racist, a homophobe, an anti-Semite, and an agist. Towering above that all, though, is his truly extraordinary misogyny, which he displays by occasionally groping women, having sex with women who are unconscious, and referring to half the human population with a vulgar reference to their genitals (it rhymes with “runt,” if you must know).The kicker is that much of it is true, this being a semi-autobiographical novel.In a time in which sexual predators are being unmasked, prosecuted, and convicted, and in which toxic masculinity is being confronted with more vigor than perhaps ever before, it is an odd experience to read a book in which the protagonist not only presents himself as an anti-hero, but the coolest sort of anti-hero imaginable: the American expatriate in Paris.Here’s the thing, though. This was written in the 1930s, when Miller’s attitudes were not only prevalent, but probably bordered on conventional wisdom. It is offensive, yes, but it is not enough to simply be offended. Instead of trying to judge or justify across the span of nearly ninety years, I’m going to approach this book on its merits.On its merits, I foundTropic of Cancerto be sort of awful.***The controversy overTropic of Cancerhas, in a way, served as a distraction from its content. Published in France in 1934, the novel was long banned as obscene in America, due to its language and sexual references (both of which, in the fullness of time, feel rather tame today). The back cover of my 1987 paperback edition, which has been sitting on various bookshelves in various houses for years, has nothing to say about the actual substance of the book, and much to say about its role in the censorship laws of the United States. I always knew I wanted to readTropic of Cancer, if only because of its outré reputation. At the same time, I hesitated, since I had no idea what it was about.Now I know what it’s about. It’s mostly about nothing.The thinly fictionalized Miller ofTropic of Canceris a penniless mooch with wild delusions of grandeur, a writer working on a project to upend the world, which he humbly callsThe Last Book. Most of his time is spent dunning the people in his life – I hesitate to call them “characters” because they are really just names – for a fewcentimesto get a drink, to sleep with a prostitute, or both. Written in the first person, most of this book’s interminable three-hundred plus pages represents a repetition of this theme.This is an essentially plotless novel that skips through time, occasionally loses itself in long stream-of-conscious passages that might have wowed me in a different life – a life in which I was perpetually eighteen and an English major – and that somehow manages to make Paris seem like one of the ugliest, dreariest places on earth. People walk into and out of the story without leaving the faintest impression. There are a couple sex scenes, but mostly there is talk about sex, and most of this talk seems to consist of men telling each other lies.I am not a stranger to disturbing content. However, I want that content to be in service to the story. Because ofTropic of Cancer’s lack of a narrative through-line, however, I mostly found the nastiness here to be in service to itself. It represents the imperious preening of a man who has Raskolnikov’s sense of self-worth, Holden Caulfield’s whininess, and Harvey Weinstein’s view of women.***Leaving aside its dispiriting ingredients, I foundTropic of Cancerto be a bit of a slog. The nonlinearity makes it difficult to know where you are in time, and because you have no idea where anything is going, it takes forever to get there.Miller does provide some benchmarks – such as his job at a newspaper – that prove helpful in orienting yourself. More than that, Miller occasionally takes you through a lucid narrative arc, some of which are effective. Asked to say one nice thing aboutTropic of Cancer, I would say that the ending scenes of the novel, in which Miller helps a friend leave the country to escape a poisonous relationship, are pretty good. In presenting his closing thoughts, Miller writes of humankind:Human beings make a strange fauna and flora. From a distance they appear negligible; close up they are apt to appear ugly and malicious. More than anything they need to be surrounded with sufficient space – space even more than time.If nothing else, Miller certainly proves that thesis: that up close, humans are ugly and malicious.***The interesting thing about the manyTropic of Cancerreviews is that they appear to be in dialogue with each other. The people who love it are quite certain that the prose is genius (“This is not a book in the ordinary sense of the word. No, this is a prolonged insult, a gob of spit in the face of Art…”), the form is groundbreaking, and that any detractors are either squeamish pearl-clutching snowflakes, or are philistines who simply don’t get it. On the other hand, the people who hate it seem to find it morally reprehensible, that reprehensibility overwhelming all other facets. Then, there is some middle ground, with people who seemed to not like the book, but maybe don’t want to say it, becauseTropic of Cancer’s reputation is so exalted.In that spirit, I feel I should stake out my position. First, I should say I am not squeamish. I worked as a defense attorney for many years, interviewing people who’d done terrible things, viewing full color, high-resolution crime scene photos of murders, and generally forming an understanding of how bad it can get. To that end, no mere words – especially not the naughty-little-boy cursing ofTropic of Cancer– are going to dictate my reaction.Second, this is not a novel I didn’t “get.” I get that this is another in a long line of navel-gazing books by an author consumed by the purported tortures of writing. I get that Miller is trying to say something about the human condition, and that with himself as a standard, he finds the human condition to be precarious.There is also a scene in this all-time classic in which Miller goes to a brothel with a man from India, and this man defecates into a bidet, and there is a big hubbub about this. To repeat: in one ofTropic of Cancer’s rare set pieces, a man poops in a bidet.Igetit.***Not every book is for everyone. I don’t think it’s crazy that some people loveTropic of Cancer, just as I find it reasonable that others would not even bother after the first handful of pages.Having been vastly underwhelmed, I couldn’t help but wonder how much ofTropic of Cancer’s literary fame came from the fact that it was banned.

            "Translation failed for: Switchedbegins with a flashback. Our narrator, a seventeen-year-old named Wendy Everly, tells us the occasion that she first became aware that she was a “monster.” She was six years old and throwing a tantrum at her own perfectly nice birthday party. But we can’t quite dismiss little Wendy as nothing but a brat, because her father died very shortly before her birthday.Wendy storms back to the kitchen to yell at her mother for buying her a chocolate cake when Mommy knows full well that Wendy doesn’t like chocolate—this is the reader’s first major clue that something’s wrong with Wendy. For this, the spoiled child deserves perhaps to be sent to bed early, lose dessert privileges, or get bopped on the head with a rolled-up newspaper.But no, Wendy’s mother declares that the little girl is a monster and no offspring of hers. She stabs at Wendy erratically with a large knife, and probably would have killed her had not eleven-year-old Matt, her biological son, stepped in just there. As is, Wendy has a giant scar on her stomach that will stay forever.Fast-forward eleven years. Matt and Wendy live with their aunt Maggie, their mother having been institutionalized shortly after the knife incident. Matt has done all right for himself, but Wendy has bombed out of several public schools, and has a rep for being sullen, difficult and rather stupid, all of which is true.There’s a boy in one of Wendy’s classes who stares at her. He has black hair and pale skin and beautiful dark eyes, and his name is Finn. On the day our story begins, Wendy decides to ask him why he stares. “Everyone stares at you,” he replies with no visible emotion. “You’re very attractive.” He’s a lot like every other sulky, leather-jacket-wearing, late 2000s paranormal YA love interest, but unlike Edward Cullen or Jace Wayland, Finn just spits it right out. Credit where credit is due.Why is he named Finn, though? A guy named Finn is almost always a wholesome character. He’s supposed to be a farm boy who shelters fugitive princesses and wears the sweaters his momma knitted for him, or a former Stormtrooper with a heart full of empathy for Resistance pilots, scavenger orphans, mechanics, and space goats. Same goes for a lad named Ben, James, Sam, or Will. The emotionally-unavailable bad boy with a hidden heart of gold archetype is more likely to be named something like Nick or Jack.Finn also tells Wendy that he’s noticed her ability to think something at someone and make them change their mind. She has always been able to do this—say, she looks at an angry teacher and thinks “You aren’t going to send me to the principal” and the teacher, a bit befuddled, sits down and tells her “You don’t have to go to the principal’s office.” Sometimes she wonders if this is what her mom meant about her being a monster. At any rate, it frightens her that Finn (or anyone, for that matter) knows of this talent of hers.She uses this talent to persuade Matt, who knows better and is very worried, to drive her to the asylum for an audience with their mom. Wendy interrogates the woman but comes away with little she didn’t already know. Her mother raves that Wendy, as a baby, somehow disposed of Michael, the mother’s biological second son, and substituted herself. Matt dismisses this as the ranting of a lunatic but his sister thinks there might be some truth to it.Wendy goes to the school dance for the first time ever, solely to talk with Finn some more, but he says something callous, she becomes enraged, and she hurriedly leaves before he can explain. Good thing he just decided to climb through her bedroom window and explain it to her anyway. This is one of a few spots where the book treads a little too close toTwilight, although given the changeling theme, it could also be a nod toPeter Pan(our heroine’s name is Wendy, after all) orLabyrinth(albeit Jareth is much, much cooler than Finn).Did I say changeling? Turns out that Wendy is not only adopted, she’s not even technically human. She belongs to a race of creatures from Norse folklore called the Trylle—known to humans as trolls, but not to be confused with the monsters that live under bridges and/or eat jellied Dwarves.Nope, these trolls—er, Trylle—look human enough, although they’re prettier than most of us and might have a green undertone to their skin.The Trylle culture is dying out. For the past several generations they have swapped their royal/high-ranking babies with human infants, so the Trylle babies can acquire wealth and education while in human society, then bring at least some of that back to their true people once they return. Finn is a Tracker, a low-ranking Trylle whose job is to find adolescent changelings and bring them home. And Wendy is the only daughter of the Trylle Queen, the inexorable Elora.Finn wants Wendy to come to the hidden Trylle stronghold in Minnesota with him, but she hedges, thinking of the worry she’d cause her aunt and especially her brother. Then she gets attacked by a rival band of Trylle, called the Vittra, and realizes she endangers her human family if she stays…Content AdvisoryViolence: Stylized, action-movie style fights between the Trylle and the Vittra. Very little actual weaponry used. Lots of punching and flying through windows. No gorier than the average Rick Riordan book.Sex: Finn and Wendy make out a few times, despite not knowing each other well at all. The night before he has to leave the settlement, he spends snuggling in bed with her—snuggling is all they do. Before that, she suspected that her mother had a creepy, Mrs. Robinson-like relationship with him; in reality,Elora had been in love with Finn’s father and had some sort of maternal feeling for him, which she squelched as soon as she realized he liked her daughter and was a threat to the Trylle aristocracy.Elora is currently having an affair with a Trylle lord, the father of one of Wendy’s new friends, which is thankfully not shown in any detail.Rhys invites Wendy to join him for aLord of the Ringsmarathon and she falls asleep on his couch. Finn gets there and assumes the absolute worst, despite a lack of any real evidence.Language: There’s one F-bomb and a variety of less pungent four-letter words in here.Substance Abuse: Social champagne drinking, including by the underage and very awkward Wendy.Nightmare Fuel: Nothing.Politics and Religion: Nothing.ConclusionSwitchedis definitely part of the post-Twilightparanormal trend: awkward brown-haired heroine, sulky love interest with no concept of personal space, glamorous hidden society in some rural part of America….too much melodrama for a story that just started and characters we barely know, and prose that veers from fine to patchy.This paperback edition includes four bonus chapters called “The Vittra Attack.” The publisher labels this a short story but it isn’t—it has no arc of its own and is hard to follow until you finally see where it connects to the main body of the story. These four chapters are from the POV of a Vittra named Loki, whom I assure you I was not picturing as Tom Hiddleston with long black hair.Ahem. Loki drives the getaway car for the two Vittra who tried to capture Wendy. He gets pushed around by the Vittra king, but is close to their queen, for some reason. Loki is never shown or mentioned in the book proper, so I don’t know why Hocking considered him important enough for his own bonus chapters. At any rate, the book would have been improved if his chapters were woven into the main book—it would have added at leastsomesense of urgency.It’s silly, fast-paced, not terribly deep, and enjoyable enough that I’ll probably read the second book. It’s a good deal better than the aforementioned Twilight Saga or the Mortal Instruments series, but not nearly as much fun as the Percy Jackson books.If you want a melodramatic YA urban fantasy trilogy that’s actually mostlygood, though, check out A.G.

            "Translation failed for: ⋰⋱⋰⋱⋰⋱*Not for me anymore*⋰⋱⋰⋱⋰⋱This review is purely for me and might contain spoilers and facts from the book to keep myself in the known at all time. It's also very long and somewhat detailed.Second re-read: 03.06.2018The book centers aroundWendy Luella Everly(17) who never fit in anywhere. She has grown up thinking she's evil because her mother hates her, calls her a mother and at six years old, tried to kill her. Turns out her mother was right; Wendy is a changeling. She was switch at birth with the real baby to gain health, education and money. Unfortunately, Wendy's life never went where it was supposed to. After being told what she is, a Trylle; a troll, she has to leave her human brother and aunt to be with her own kind. Always wanted to fit in, to be loved, she got quite a surprised when she arrived at Förening, where the Trylle lives.“Sorry to disturb your sleep.” Mr. Meade cleared his throat so I would look up at him.“It’s okay,” I said.Overall, I'm a really picky reader now, which I'm certain I wasn't in the beginning. Now I pick at everything, even the smallest thing, and in this book I picked a lot. It was too much of a insta-love connection between Wendy and Finn. I mean, she felt so much for him just by taking to him three times.. After 24% and a meeting/talking of four-fiveshorttimes, she has fallen for him.‘He touched my cheek again, just with his fingertips, sending flutters through me. He studied my injury intently, and then his eyes met mine, dark and wonderful. It was at that moment that I knew I had officially fallen for him.’This bothered me a lot. If it weren't for the fact that I had already read this series, I would've quitted the book by 24%.“Trylle is the name of our ‘tribe,’ if you will.” He rubbed the side of his temple. “This is hard to explain. We are, um, trolls.”“You’re telling me that I’m a troll?” I raised one eyebrow, and finally decided that he must be insane.Wendy seemsnaive, incrediblyweak(she lets everyone walk all over her, even though it's not her fault), and frankly a little dumbat times. You really get the feeling that this is YA, even though the main character soon turns 18. Things go to fast; like Wendy is attacked once, Finn makes them go away and she's all ready to leave with him straight away, even though she had already said no because of Matt. She changed her mind in less than a day. It really annoyed me. There's no build up. But this is not to say the doesn't have potential. It does. A lot. The changeling story is quite interesting, so is the plot. I just wish there was no insta-love feelings and that things where more mature. Can you imagine howamazingthis book would've been if it was new adult?PS! The series has been taken from the ‘favorite’ shelf, and Wendy has been taken away from the ‘kick-ass-heroines’ shelf. What was I thinking with the last one? She is nowhere near a fighter.New rating: 2 stars“Did you think you could treat me like shit at a dance, then sneak into my room in the middle of the night and tell me that I'm a troll with magical powers, and I'd just be like, yeah, that sounds right.”Förening, The Changelings, The Trylle & The Vittra:I've put these in a spoilers tag simply because it's a long list.- Förening is where the Trylle lives.- Förening is in Minnesota, along the Mississippi River in a very secluded area,.- Förening is a town, sort of. They consider it to be more of a compound, but in the way the Kennedys have a compound. It’s just a glorified gated community, really.- Förening is entirely Trylle, trackers, and mänsklig. There are about five thousand who live there in total, and they have gas stations, a small grocery store, and a school. It’s a very small, quiet community.- Förening is populated with Trylle. The term Trylle is a distinction similar to a tribe. They are trolls, and over the years, the troll population has been dwindling. Their numbers used to be great, but now there are less than a million of them on the entire planet.- The Trylle never really fit in anywhere in the human world. They have a quick temper. They’re very intelligent and a picky eater. They hate shoes. Their hair is hard to control. They have dark brown eyes, dark brown hair; earth tones. Their eyes and hair are always earth tones. And oftentimes their skin has almost a greenish hue to it.- Trylle are, to the layman, trolls, but that term is antiquated and demeaning, which doesn’t do them justice at all. They are beings closely related to humans, but more in tune with themselves. They have abilities, intelligence, and beauty that far surpass that of humans.- There are two important distinctions to their lifestyle as Trylle that separate them from the humans; they want to live a quiet life communing with the earth and themselves. They work to strengthen their abilities and use them to better their lives, to protect themselves and the things around them. They devote their entire lives to this. Förening exists only to preserve and enhance the Trylle way of life.- The other distinction is how they maintain this lifestyle, although it isn’t that different, really; human children have their schools, but these places prepare them for a life of servitude. That’s not what they want. They want a life of complete and total freedom. That is why they have changelings.- The changeling practice dates back hundreds, maybe thousands of years. Originally they were forest dwellers, far less . . . industrialized than now. Their children were prone to starvation and medical problems, and they did not have an adequate educational system. So they’d leave their babies in place of human children so they would have the benefits that only a human childhood could offer, then when they were old enough they would come back to them.- That practice evolved because they evolved. Changelings were healthier, more educated, and wealthier than the Trylle counterparts that stayed behind. Eventually, every child born became a changeling. In order to maintain their current level of existence, they’d have to leave the solace of the compound and spend their lives doing menial jobs. That simply would not do, so they leave their children with the most sophisticated, wealthiest human families.- The changelings live a childhood that is the best this world has to offer, and then return with an inheritance from their host families that infuses their society with wealth. That, of course, isn’t the only goal, but it is a large part of how they can live like this. The money they obtain from their host family will support them for the rest of their life. Simply said; The changelings are there so that Trylle doesn't have to work.- The Trylle are not all created equal; Trylle are far more gifted than the others. Vittra are lucky to have any abilities. Adding Wendy, for example, to their ranks would greatly add to their power and influence.- Trylle are one of the largest tribes left, but they are not the only one.- The Vittra are a warring faction, and they are forever looking to pick off some of them. Either by turning them to their side, or simply by getting rid of them.“When something is important to you, you make sure its safe.”The monarchy:I've put these in a spoilers tag simply because it's a long list.There is royalty, of which Wendy are at the top, after Elora, of course. Below her there are the Markis and Marksinna, but they can become Kings and Queens through marriage. Then there are the average Trylle, the common folk, if you will. Below that there are trackers. And at the very bottom, there are mänsklig.- The trackers so low because though they are Trylle, but they only track. Finn's parents were trackers, and their parents before them, and so on. They have no changeling population. Ever. That means that they have no income. They bring nothing into the community. They provide a service for other Trylle, and in return They are provided with a home and food. They are almost like an indentured servant. Until they retire from tracking, they don’t need to do anything else. Many trackers, such as Finn, will work as a guard for some of the families in town. All of the service jobs, like the nannies, the teachers, the chefs, the maids, are almost entirely retired trackers, and they make an hourly wage. Some are also mänsklig, but they stick around less and less.- The roles of the Markis and Marksinna: in other provinces, where the King and Queen don’t live, the Markis and Marksinna are the leaders. They’re like governors or something. In times when the King or Queen can’t fulfill their duties, a Markis can step up and take their place. In places like Förening, their title is mostly just a way of saying that they’re better than everyone else, but they don’t really have any power.- The role of the Chancellor: the Chancellor is an elected official, much like the prime minister in England. The monarchy has the final word and wields the most power, but the Chancellor serves as their adviser and helps give the Trylle commoners a voice in the way the government is run.- Theoretically, The Trylle follows the law of America, and for the most part Trylle laws coincide with American laws, except that they have more of them. However, they live in separate pockets unto themselves. Using their resources—namely, cash and persuasion—they can get government officials to look the other way, and they conduct our business in private.- The Markis and Marksinna are what they are because of the abilities they have, and they are passed down through their children. Regular Trylle have some abilities, but they’ve faded with time. Wendy's mother is one of the most powerful Queens they’ve had in a very long time, and the hope is that Wendy will continue the tradition of power.“I look at you because I can't look away.”Other characters:I've put these in a spoilers tag simply because it's a long list; contains spoilers.↦Finn Holmes(20), a Trylle and a tracker; it’s his job.

All she knows is what she paints, she doesn’t see anything. She picks up the brush, and it just. . . comes out. She has no control over what she sees↦Rhys, a mänsklig ‘mänks’. The literal translation for mänsklig is ‘human’. Rhys is human. He were switched at birth because of a changeling; Wendy. Meaning that when she took the place of another baby, that baby had to go somewhere else. Meaning Rhys is Michael, Matt's real brother..↦Willa Strom(21), a Trylle. Finn had been a tracker for Willa, so he knew her and her father,Garrett Stroms(in his mid-forties), quite well. Garrett’s wife - Willa’s mother - had died some years earlier. According to Finn, Garrett was easygoing, but Willa was a tad high-strung. Prior to living in Förening, she’d been privileged to the point of excess. The Stroms are very good friends of Elora. Willa can controlled the wind and her official title is Marksinna. Her dad is a Markis, which is just a male Marksinna.↦Rhiannon, a mänsklig ‘mänks’. Rhiannon is Willa’s mänsklig.↦Aurora Kroner, Trylle and a Marksinn, her husband,Noah Kronerand their son,Tove Kroner(19). The Kroners are very important people. They affect the future. Tove is a psychic. He can sense things. And he can move things with his mind. But he can’t read your thoughts. He can see auras, though. Colors. He is particularly sensitive to emotion. And when he move things, it helps focus him. He’s like the highest Markis in the world, which is weird. The Marksinna are usually the ones with all the abilities. Guys can do some things, but they pale in comparison to what women can do, yet Tove has more ability than anybody else. Aurora’s a healer. She can touch you and fix you. That’s her ability. There are maybe six or seven other families in Förening alone with the same title. The Kroners were next in line for the crown if Wendy didn’t come back. They’re real powerful.↦Oren, the Vittra King.Sara, his queen.↦JenandKyra, Vittra trackers.How had it turned into this?

But yes, if you like YA, I guess.Will I read this again in the future?- No.New Rating- 2 stars.Re-read: 27.03.15Still an amazing book! Though, if I remember correctly, I think I love the second book the most.. Will just have to see.. On to the next one on my re-reading!New rate: 4.5 stars.First read review:Interesting book. Can't wait to read next one!First rate: 5 stars., error: ⋰⋱⋰⋱⋰⋱*Not for me anymore*⋰⋱⋰⋱⋰⋱This review is purely for me and might contain spoilers and facts from the book to keep myself in the known at all time. It's also very long and somewhat detailed.Second re-read: 03.06.2018The book centers aroundWendy Luella Everly(17) who never fit in anywhere. She has grown up thinking she's evil because her mother hates her, calls her a mother and at six years old, tried to kill her. Turns out her mother was right; Wendy is a changeling. She was switch at birth with the real baby to gain health, education and money. Unfortunately, Wendy's life never went where it was supposed to. After being told what she is, a Trylle; a troll, she has to leave her human brother and aunt to be with her own kind. Always wanted to fit in, to be loved, she got quite a surprised when she arrived at Förening, where the Trylle lives.“Sorry to disturb your sleep.” Mr. Meade cleared his throat so I would look up at him.“It’s okay,” I said.Overall, I'm a really picky reader now, which I'm certain I wasn't in the beginning. Now I pick at everything, even the smallest thing, and in this book I picked a lot. It was too much of a insta-love connection between Wendy and Finn. I mean, she felt so much for him just by taking to him three times.. After 24% and a meeting/talking of four-fiveshorttimes, she has fallen for him.‘He touched my cheek again, just with his fingertips, sending flutters through me. He studied my injury intently, and then his eyes met mine, dark and wonderful. It was at that moment that I knew I had officially fallen for him.’This bothered me a lot. If it weren't for the fact that I had already read this series, I would've quitted the book by 24%.“Trylle is the name of our ‘tribe,’ if you will.” He rubbed the side of his temple. “This is hard to explain. We are, um, trolls.”“You’re telling me that I’m a troll?” I raised one eyebrow, and finally decided that he must be insane.Wendy seemsnaive, incrediblyweak(she lets everyone walk all over her, even though it's not her fault), and frankly a little dumbat times. You really get the feeling that this is YA, even though the main character soon turns 18. Things go to fast; like Wendy is attacked once, Finn makes them go away and she's all ready to leave with him straight away, even though she had already said no because of Matt. She changed her mind in less than a day. It really annoyed me. There's no build up. But this is not to say the doesn't have potential. It does. A lot. The changeling story is quite interesting, so is the plot. I just wish there was no insta-love feelings and that things where more mature. Can you imagine howamazingthis book would've been if it was new adult?PS! The series has been taken from the ‘favorite’ shelf, and Wendy has been taken away from the ‘kick-ass-heroines’ shelf. What was I thinking with the last one? She is nowhere near a fighter.New rating: 2 stars“Did you think you could treat me like shit at a dance, then sneak into my room in the middle of the night and tell me that I'm a troll with magical powers, and I'd just be like, yeah, that sounds right.”Förening, The Changelings, The Trylle & The Vittra:I've put these in a spoilers tag simply because it's a long list.- Förening is where the Trylle lives.- Förening is in Minnesota, along the Mississippi River in a very secluded area,.- Förening is a town, sort of. They consider it to be more of a compound, but in the way the Kennedys have a compound. It’s just a glorified gated community, really.- Förening is entirely Trylle, trackers, and mänsklig. There are about five thousand who live there in total, and they have gas stations, a small grocery store, and a school. It’s a very small, quiet community.- Förening is populated with Trylle. The term Trylle is a distinction similar to a tribe. They are trolls, and over the years, the troll population has been dwindling. Their numbers used to be great, but now there are less than a million of them on the entire planet.- The Trylle never really fit in anywhere in the human world. They have a quick temper. They’re very intelligent and a picky eater. They hate shoes. Their hair is hard to control. They have dark brown eyes, dark brown hair; earth tones. Their eyes and hair are always earth tones. And oftentimes their skin has almost a greenish hue to it.- Trylle are, to the layman, trolls, but that term is antiquated and demeaning, which doesn’t do them justice at all. They are beings closely related to humans, but more in tune with themselves. They have abilities, intelligence, and beauty that far surpass that of humans.- There are two important distinctions to their lifestyle as Trylle that separate them from the humans; they want to live a quiet life communing with the earth and themselves. They work to strengthen their abilities and use them to better their lives, to protect themselves and the things around them. They devote their entire lives to this. Förening exists only to preserve and enhance the Trylle way of life.- The other distinction is how they maintain this lifestyle, although it isn’t that different, really; human children have their schools, but these places prepare them for a life of servitude. That’s not what they want. They want a life of complete and total freedom. That is why they have changelings.- The changeling practice dates back hundreds, maybe thousands of years. Originally they were forest dwellers, far less . . . industrialized than now. Their children were prone to starvation and medical problems, and they did not have an adequate educational system. So they’d leave their babies in place of human children so they would have the benefits that only a human childhood could offer, then when they were old enough they would come back to them.- That practice evolved because they evolved. Changelings were healthier, more educated, and wealthier than the Trylle counterparts that stayed behind. Eventually, every child born became a changeling. In order to maintain their current level of existence, they’d have to leave the solace of the compound and spend their lives doing menial jobs. That simply would not do, so they leave their children with the most sophisticated, wealthiest human families.- The changelings live a childhood that is the best this world has to offer, and then return with an inheritance from their host families that infuses their society with wealth. That, of course, isn’t the only goal, but it is a large part of how they can live like this. The money they obtain from their host family will support them for the rest of their life. Simply said; The changelings are there so that Trylle doesn't have to work.- The Trylle are not all created equal; Trylle are far more gifted than the others. Vittra are lucky to have any abilities. Adding Wendy, for example, to their ranks would greatly add to their power and influence.- Trylle are one of the largest tribes left, but they are not the only one.- The Vittra are a warring faction, and they are forever looking to pick off some of them. Either by turning them to their side, or simply by getting rid of them.“When something is important to you, you make sure its safe.”The monarchy:I've put these in a spoilers tag simply because it's a long list.There is royalty, of which Wendy are at the top, after Elora, of course. Below her there are the Markis and Marksinna, but they can become Kings and Queens through marriage. Then there are the average Trylle, the common folk, if you will. Below that there are trackers. And at the very bottom, there are mänsklig.- The trackers so low because though they are Trylle, but they only track. Finn's parents were trackers, and their parents before them, and so on. They have no changeling population. Ever. That means that they have no income. They bring nothing into the community. They provide a service for other Trylle, and in return They are provided with a home and food. They are almost like an indentured servant. Until they retire from tracking, they don’t need to do anything else. Many trackers, such as Finn, will work as a guard for some of the families in town. All of the service jobs, like the nannies, the teachers, the chefs, the maids, are almost entirely retired trackers, and they make an hourly wage. Some are also mänsklig, but they stick around less and less.- The roles of the Markis and Marksinna: in other provinces, where the King and Queen don’t live, the Markis and Marksinna are the leaders. They’re like governors or something. In times when the King or Queen can’t fulfill their duties, a Markis can step up and take their place. In places like Förening, their title is mostly just a way of saying that they’re better than everyone else, but they don’t really have any power.- The role of the Chancellor: the Chancellor is an elected official, much like the prime minister in England. The monarchy has the final word and wields the most power, but the Chancellor serves as their adviser and helps give the Trylle commoners a voice in the way the government is run.- Theoretically, The Trylle follows the law of America, and for the most part Trylle laws coincide with American laws, except that they have more of them. However, they live in separate pockets unto themselves. Using their resources—namely, cash and persuasion—they can get government officials to look the other way, and they conduct our business in private.- The Markis and Marksinna are what they are because of the abilities they have, and they are passed down through their children. Regular Trylle have some abilities, but they’ve faded with time. Wendy's mother is one of the most powerful Queens they’ve had in a very long time, and the hope is that Wendy will continue the tradition of power.“I look at you because I can't look away.”Other characters:I've put these in a spoilers tag simply because it's a long list; contains spoilers.↦Finn Holmes(20), a Trylle and a tracker; it’s his job.

            "Translation failed for: This is a book about the bubonic plague so I am basically expected this by the end:Spoilers abound below along with a not insignificant amount of profanity:So, expecting this book to be bleak, I shunted all of the emotions I anticipated feeling into the area of my heart where I keep my New York Mets fandom. You know, these guys:Sufficed to say their years of incompetence and disappointment have formed a nice level of scar tissue over that part of my metaphorical heart. So whatever this book was going to throw at me I knew it wouldn't sink its emotional claws into me.That being said, fuck this book. It was a never ending parade of despair, death, exploitation, inhumanity, and suffering with a little dash of hope thrown in every so often to make the subsequent despair, death, exploitation, inhumanity, and suffering that much worse. I swear, the town this takes place in (based on an actual town,Eyam) must have killed the writer's grandmother considering the amount of suffering she heaps upon the inhabitants. If I wanted this level of depression I would just read a non-fiction book about the plague.Look, I understand that this book was about a horrible situation. The town voluntarily (and, might I had, quite nobly) secluded itself from the outside world once it was clear they were infected with the Bubonic plague (not the Black Death vintage, but one of the later outbreaks calledThe Great Plague of London). And yes, under those conditions some pretty terrible stuff will (and did) happen.My issue with this book, though, was how the author presented the situation. Like I said, it was a never ending parade of death and despair. I was often introduced to families with the preface that they had already lost X amount of children plus one or both of the parents. I can feel bad for them on an abstract level, but if I didn't know them before hand it is difficult for me to rouse much emotional connection with them. They are just another set of future (or existing) corpses that I shouldn't bother getting to know or care about.There are a few characters we get to know quite well.Anna, the narrator. A peasant women in the employ of the local rector and widow to a local miner with two children. Michael Mompellion, the local rector and moral backbone of the community who proposes the the self quarantine. Elinor Mompellion, the wife of Michael who is a (positive) force to be reckoned with. Extremely empathetic, very hands on when it comes to problems, and generally a wonderful woman.We are also introduced to some other characters as well: Anna's father and step-mother, the Gowdies (a Aunt/Niece pair who have extensive herblore) and the Bradfords (local well to do family).So, some of the terrible things that the author heaps upon the reader:-The lynching of the Gowdies because people thought they were witches. There goes just about all of the herblore for the village, forcing Elinor and Anna to learn everything on their own.-Drug abuse (poppies in this case)-Child abuse-A crude form of crucifixion of Anna's father after he tries to kill someone in order to claim the victim's goods as payment for digging a grave (the previous person who did that died of a heart attack from overwork, another cheery note).-Anna's step mother, Aphra, going crazy from grief both from losing her own children (yes, lots and lots of children die) and having her husband die from the aforementioned crucifixion after Anna does not go to free him (she expected Aphra to do it but Aphra was at her home taking care of her children who all came down with the plague in shortly after the crucifixion). Aphra begins to masquerade as the ghost of one of the Gowdies, selling people fake supernatural remedies.-Child sacrifice-Families felled in such numbers that the village runs out of consecrated ground-Despair that drives some folks to self-flagellation-Attempted infanticide-Unnecessary mention of the slave trade. Not because the practice didn't occur, but because of all the other terrible things that have happened why include yet another terrible aspect of humanity during this time on top of everything else as part of a throw away line?-Elinor, whom we know at the beginning of the book is dead, comes down with the plague. So while you expect her to die she makes a recovery. Sounds good right? Nope, she gets killed when Aphra goes even crazier and stabs her to death in front of what is left of the village.-The Rector, Michael, after being a pillar of strength for the community, is broken by the death of Elinor and loses his faith (can't really blame him for that). But after hooking up with Anna (biblically speaking) he reveals that he never had sex with Elinor as a punishment for her sin of killing her out-of-wedlock child in the womb (using a heated iron brand no less). He specifically said that he strove to make her love him more and more so that his withholding of sex would hurt her that much more. Talk about a stone hearted, crazy religious zealot son of a bitch. Of course, because Anna become such good friends with Elinor and we see how great of a person Elinor is, this comes off as even more depressing and is a complete 180 from his previous personality to the point where it felt very jarring.So like I said, this book was fucking bleak. Everyone I was introduced to ended up dead, crazy, or deeply emotionally scarred (or were just terrible people to begin with). By the end we were left wwith this:Yes, the ending was sort of happy (if you ignore the mountain of corpses you had to climb over to get there), but Michael's crazy genes got passed on to another generation and the happiness lasted all of three pages before the book ended.There are ways to write bleak, depressing stories that don't involve constantly hitting the reader over the head with all the terrible things happening. After the third or fourth family is wiped out by the plague, the marginal emotional impact of each subsequent family death is extremely low. By the time I was halfway through the book every terrible thing the author dumped on poor Anna or the village just elicited a heavy sigh, not unlike the sighs I utter when the Mets once again find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.Upon final analysis this book failed for me because I did not resonate emotionally with any of the characters and the never ending parade of death and destruction just sort of numbed me to the entire experience. Family of seven wiped out by the plague? How passe. Drowning a baby? Par for the course. Crazy lady with a giant knife that slays the most beloved character in the village? Not terribly surprising. Religious man turns out to be a heartless self-righteous jackass? Certainly surprising, but completely undercuts any good feelings I had towards him this entire book.If you are interested in seeing a community collapse and die off from a plague and their own inhumanity, you might like this book. The writing and descriptions are quite sharp and well crafted, just expect a windmill full of corpses by the end., error: This is a book about the bubonic plague so I am basically expected this by the end:Spoilers abound below along with a not insignificant amount of profanity:So, expecting this book to be bleak, I shunted all of the emotions I anticipated feeling into the area of my heart where I keep my New York Mets fandom.

            "Translation failed for: 1.5/5“Do you know what punishments I've endured for my crimes, my sins?\"<- I read The Way of Shadows by Brent Weeks, I think that's punishment enough for my sins.This novel had a promising start, I really enjoyed the start and was excited to fangirl over this novel for eternity, as everyone already knows I am Brent Weeks trash & I'm not ashamed to admit it. So I expected to absolutely adore this book, to be submerged in feels and just want to cuddle it for long hours and cry tears of adoration. Having a promising start and being quite fun I thought I'd hit the lottery. It starts off with some Locke Lamorr vibes, a bunch of young children living in a guild. A tiny 9 year old girl gets cut up for fun and a young boy is raped into submission. Extremely grim and totally had my full attention, however it quickly went sour from there and I lost interest very fast and after a while I realised I hadn't hit the lottery at all and what I instead had was a cliche novel full of tropes, sucky names and forced badassery. Lets be honest here folks the writing was extremely choppy and lacked direction, most of the story itself was talking and talking is boring. I wanted a lot more show instead of tell. But weeks only delivered 5% show the rest was just lines of whining and a POV from an insecure child... sound familiar? Kylar (Azroth) is a twin of Kip (lightbringer series) except it's not \"I'm so fat\" instead it is \"I can't protect those I love.. Wah Wah Wah\". I don't know if it's a case of its me and not you Brent Weeks, or it's a full blown case of it was definitely Brent Weeks fault why I disliked this novel so much and can't continue with this series because it's the same old crap from his other series and I can't be bothered reading garbage. Maybe I've just out grown Brent Weeks stupid horny school boy writing style? I'm not sure. I honestly hope not tho...because I am and always will be Gavin Guile (lightbringer series) trash.Another major issue I had with the novel is the use of the word \"Wetboy\" for an assassin name.. shittest assassin name ever... like ever.. How could someone even justify calling a killer such a pathetically shit name? I'm not even kidding right now, anything would have been better and tougher then that name. I can think of atleast 7 names which would have been cooler and more appropriate. When I think of a Wetboy I think of something a pedophile would google or that awkward moment after my toddlers bath and I chase him around the house with a towel screaming \"get here boy, your wet\".So this book is marketed as \"grimdark\" or \"dark fantasy\" WHICH ACTUALLY RUFFLES MY FEATHERS. What a load of dog shit.. About two things in this novel could be considered grim & both happened in the first 100 pages. The main character is an assassin who ONLY KILLS BAD PEOPLE. WHICH THEREFOR MAKES HIM A HERO. He is not a grey character but instead pure white.“It is better to suffer evil than to do evil.”are you sure about that? Pretty sure only evil people become assassins but anyway.. you go be white and a hero Kylar, no one gives a fuck. I'm so bored of your standard black/white characters, they honestly have no depth or personality and I'm not interested in heroes, they are boring.But my main problem with this book is the lack of originality and the fact it stunk so badly of this authors other series that I can't even forgive this for being a debut novel,Brent has brought nothing new to the fantasy genre or his own writing style. It was actually pretty childish and kinda lame. Are we certain this series wasn't written by Brent at age 12? When he first hit puberty and could only think about sex, girls and wanking?“Life is empty. Life is meaningless. When we take a life, we arn't taking anything of value. Wetboys are killers. Thats all we do. Thats all we are. There are no poets in the bitter business.”The story is basically about a child named Azroth who wants to become an assassin so he can stand up to his bullies in the guild and protect his friends. One night he runs into Durzo Blint the baddest and deadliest assassin going around. Durzo doesn't take on apprentices so it's Azroths job to impress him and show Durzo why he should be apprenticed. After awhile Azroths changes his name to Kylar Stern and to be honest the book gets more and more cliched towards the ending. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for a well done cliche plot; I love assassins, I love magic, I love the hateful but nice mentor, I love the weak boy who turns into a strong focused individual trope.. What can I say I just love tropes, however this book just made me roll my eyes, it was boring, annoying, I honestly felt like I had read this book 1000 times over. It's safe to say I'm actually sick of these tropes, this was not a warm trope cuddle more of a trope slap. But it wasn't all bad there was a few redeeming factors; some of the twists and plot points were unpredictable and made the story more interesting, the magic system was interesting, Durzo Blint was cool... Ummm.. *cough*.. Hmm let me think.. That's literally all I can think of... So yeah pretty much a bust.Recommended to people looking for a novel to begin with in the adult fantasy genre.Ps. Safe to say I will not read the rest of the series because quite frankly I got better things to do. 😴😴, error: 1.5/5“Do you know what punishments I've endured for my crimes, my sins?\"<- I read The Way of Shadows by Brent Weeks, I think that's punishment enough for my sins.This novel had a promising start, I really enjoyed the start and was excited to fangirl over this novel for eternity, as everyone already knows I am Brent Weeks trash & I'm not ashamed to admit it. So I expected to absolutely adore this book, to be submerged in feels and just want to cuddle it for long hours and cry tears of adoration. Having a promising start and being quite fun I thought I'd hit the lottery. It starts off with some Locke Lamorr vibes, a bunch of young children living in a guild. A tiny 9 year old girl gets cut up for fun and a young boy is raped into submission. Extremely grim and totally had my full attention, however it quickly went sour from there and I lost interest very fast and after a while I realised I hadn't hit the lottery at all and what I instead had was a cliche novel full of tropes, sucky names and forced badassery. Lets be honest here folks the writing was extremely choppy and lacked direction, most of the story itself was talking and talking is boring. I wanted a lot more show instead of tell. But weeks only delivered 5% show the rest was just lines of whining and a POV from an insecure child... sound familiar? Kylar (Azroth) is a twin of Kip (lightbringer series) except it's not \"I'm so fat\" instead it is \"I can't protect those I love.. Wah Wah Wah\". I don't know if it's a case of its me and not you Brent Weeks, or it's a full blown case of it was definitely Brent Weeks fault why I disliked this novel so much and can't continue with this series because it's the same old crap from his other series and I can't be bothered reading garbage. Maybe I've just out grown Brent Weeks stupid horny school boy writing style? I'm not sure. I honestly hope not tho...because I am and always will be Gavin Guile (lightbringer series) trash.Another major issue I had with the novel is the use of the word \"Wetboy\" for an assassin name.. shittest assassin name ever... like ever.. How could someone even justify calling a killer such a pathetically shit name? I'm not even kidding right now, anything would have been better and tougher then that name. I can think of atleast 7 names which would have been cooler and more appropriate.

            "Translation failed for: 2 - 2 1/2 StarsUpdated reviewI have been looking forward to this book. I do not know why exactly because I haven't particularly loved the other books in this series. Nor have I loved the last several books. I want to love them. I want to love them all. Alas, it hasn't happened. However, I keep coming back.I keep running into the same issues. But I am getting ahead of myself. I decided to do an audiobook. I think that was a mistake. I have a sort of love/hate thing with the narrator. She's done a ton (most?) of Balogh books. But for me, there's something missing. Don't get me wrong, she's a decent narrator. However, I find her to be too...stiff(?) or is it too...proper(?). I do not know how else to describe it. I think it needed another narrator.I found myself nodding off repeatedly. (Think due to a combination of the narrator and story-just not keeping my interest.) I really liked the idea of a non-ton, kind of average Hero (Ben) and non- ravishingly beautiful Heroine (Jennifer). However, as other reviewers mentioned, there wasn't much of a plot. It mostly revolved around the fete (the prep for it) Besides that, IMO Balogh can be quite repetitive. The reader is told again and again, about various people and their relationships to one another. Additionally, there is constant summarizing. For example, say there's a scene. Then later on, there a recap given of it. (Sometimes not long afterwards!) Multiple recaps are given of the same scene(s), some thought or etc. It drives me a little batty. (Even my memory is not that bad to need these constant reminders. That's how I view them.) This is not new. It has happened in previous books. Previously, I have been able to get through them (and basically overlook this quirk of the writer) due to the story/characters/plot being engaging. Lately, not so much.Then there's the number of characters! Whew! If I actually counted all of them, it would have to be 2 dozen at least. Aside from the main characters/couple (Ben/Jennifer), we have a slew of other folks vying for the reader's attention. Such as the former MCs AND secondary characters from the previous books in the series (even one from the Westcott series). Add to these the characters (introduced) in this book. (Even Ben's letter and its consequences adds more folks.)Several of these (secondary) characters are given quite a bit of 'screen time'. The reader even gets several of their POVs! (Even Joy's POV. SMH) Some have their own romances. Even possible lead characters for the next book were hinted at (and they too were given a bit of 'screen time' as well. Ben's daughter, Joy, was featured A LOT. Personally, I think a bit too much. I am not a big fan of kids being featured predominately in a HR. I also had a hard time believing she was only three. She was beyond precocious. IMHO, this took away from the flow of the story. Ben and Jennifer were often overshadowed by all this clutter for lack of a better word. I think if would have been better if some of these 'scenes' were omitted, or just later 'told' about and not 'shown'.Alright, all this and I haven't even said much about the MCs! I like them individually and as a couple. I would have liked--no, LOVED--if it concentrated more on them. If they had been given more time together time...possibly even in different setting (i.e. non-family only setting, Ben's home?).I also think it would have been helpful to see the impact of them being together as a couple. This does not happen until the very end. And even then, they are separated the majority of that time! Really?!!! The whole thing about them being together...how society would frown on it. It was supposed to be a big no-no etc. The reader is NEVER shown the result/consequences of their couple-hood/engagement/marriage. Not even in an epilogue. I personally found that disappointing. I was like, WAS it really that big a deal after all? In the end, it seemed to peter-out.As in many Balogh's books, the family theme was emphasized: a VERY large, close-knit family. Jennifer's family loved her, but they coddle...even smothered her a bit. Surprisingly, they were initially resistant to the ideas that would give her greater independence (AND hello more enjoyment in life). It took Ben, for her to realize her capabilities. To move out of her comfort zone (and family shadow). Ben is kind and a great father. He too has been held back as it were but in a different way. With Jennifer, he has finally found someone he could be his true self with.Recap. Balogh writing is great, as usual. However, the plot was slow moving (and a bit boring). And for me there were too many characters, which overtook the main characters (H/h) and muddled the plot/story. Again, I listened to the audiobook. I read some of the print version, and it was a bit better. Since I haven't loved the previous books in the series; I am not sure if I will continue with it.

            "Translation failed for: This is going to be a very unpopular review. So, to all of you who may hate me after reading this, I apologize in advance.From the rave reviews, and based onthe vast number of people who seemingly loved this book enough to tattoo a representation of it on their body, I expected it to blow me away. I love fantasy, I love stories with a kick-ass female lead, and despite the fact that this might tell you a bit more about me than you bargained for, I was really looking forward to enjoying a bit of pain and pleasure vicariously through this book.Unfortunately, every single one of those things fell very short for me.I consider myself to be a pretty patient person. I can wait through a not-so-great beginning to get to a great story. I can even wait through a bad beginning, and a lukewarm middle to get to a great, everything-comes-together-in-the-end ending.But, no. It started so promisingly, the very beginning setting the stage for an intricate world, society, plot, and story... and then proceeded to annoy me for the next 296 pages. After page 300, it did pick up, but \"fast paced\" doesn't always equal \"good\".Some of the annoying stuff:- Foreshadowing- Allusions- Foreshadowing- Euphemisms- Foreshadowing- Wordiness- ForeshadowingFORESHADOWING. *narrows eyes*Oddly enough, before reading this, my friend said something along the lines of, \"I have to warn you, the foreshadowing is very heavy-handed.\" To which I replied, \"Oh, I probably wouldn't have even noticed if you hadn't told me.\" (Oh silly me.) To which SHE replied, \"Yes. You would.\"Friend, 1.Becky, 0.I have never, ever, seen clumsier foreshadowing in my life.Had I known, then, that this book would test my patience, stamina and sanity, would I have kept reading?No. I wouldn't have. I finished this book because I promised that friend I would read it, so I did. Every page contained a new attempt at suspense... If books came with soundtracks, this one's theme would be \"DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNN!!\"But let's move on and not beat a dead horse. The foreshadowing wasn't the only thing to aggravate me, although it was the most prevalent. We also have the irritating allusions to things that apparently we're supposed to know already.The first, and the one that sticks out most in my head, is a reference to a poem that Phedre read in which a man, who was in love with a woman, \"unmanned\" himself for her. No further detail than that. What does that mean? Did he humble himself before the woman, therefore removing any manliness from his status? Did he physically cut off his manhood? What was the point of the throw-away reference? It never comes up again, so it's not a \"Hey, you might want to remember me for later\" tidbit, it's an annoying slice of \"Haha! Bet you'd like to know what I'm all about, wouldn't ya?\".There were several other situations in which Phedre mentioned things like \"...the whole world knows this, so I won't mention it...\". Oh. OK. Thanks. Wouldn't want you to strain something.Then there were the euphemisms. My favorite being \"Pearl of Naamah\". Why do men have anatomical boy parts (albeit called the annoyingly repetitive \"phallus\"), but girl parts are given a name like the \"Pearl of Naamah\"?Moving on to the general wordiness. Carey must have had her thesaurus handy while writing this book. So many of her sentences just seem to wander around without actually going anywhere. I'm sure she was going for an old-world feel. People back in the day didn't speak like we do now. Got it. But there's a line that when crossed takes you from \"perfectly worded and appropriate for the theme you're going for\" to \"Can we possibly say something in between the 'twixts' and 'tweres'?\".So now let's look at some of the words, shall we? In no particular order:Bistre- Cool word for brown. Overused.Thus- Thus it was that the word thus was thus overused.Somewhat- My absolute favorite of the annoying words. Universally used to replace \"something\", this word just crawled onto my last nerve and dug in its heels. It jarred in every single usage and ruined the flow of every sentence that contained it. VERY overused and unnecessary.Vaster- Just sounds grammatically wrong. Plus overused.Betimes- Overused.Compass- Apparently used to replace \"comprehend\" in certain scenarios. I searched, and can't find a single reference to the word being used in this way anywhere - if you can, please link me to it, it's making me crazy.There were many others, those are just the ones I wrote down.Miscellaneous other bothersome things:- \"Seed\": Yes, this is euphemism for semen, and you might be asking yourself why I didn't mention it above. Well, I will tell you why. Seeds grow into stuff when planted. Can someone please explain to me how it is that Phedre had so many romps with so many men releasing themselves into her and yet never got pregnant? You might be saying to yourself, but this is fantasy, it doesn't matter! Yes, it does. This is a realistic story set in an alternate world, and obviously since Phedre herself is \"a whore's unwanted get\", the subject might be addressed as to how she prevented her own \"unwanted get\".- Melisande: Pointless. Plot. Device.- Forced sequel: Carey could have (should have?) and DID end this book perfectly. And then she kept writing, and in so doing, forced the ending into a situation that would require a sequel. Nice try. I'm forgetting I read the last few pages as I type. This story is ended for me, I think.There... Now we can talk about what I liked.Joscelin. Thank goodness for Joscelin. I really would have had to give up on this book if it wasn't for him. He was really predictable, but I loved him anyway. He kicked ass, like a ninja priest.Hyacinthe. Loved him too - he was fun, and one of the only unique characters in the book.Delaunay. He was awesome. Smart, honest, honorable.I did like the concept of love as a sacred act, and I liked the references to different religions. I enjoyed the different people and their customs, and enjoyed the intricate relationships between everyone and the political aspects of the story. I liked the fact that Delaunay taught Phedre to learn and think and analyze. I like the concept of the thirteen houses, which reminded me of Geisha houses. I liked the Tsingani people, who were fun and boisterous and superstitious and sly. I loved Rousse's men, who were brave and smart and thought of cool songs. I liked Ysandre, who was young and wise and fair. I liked Drustan, too. And Alcuin who was soft-hearted but had a will of steel.I can see how some people would like this book. Unfortunately, I can't count myself among them. Too much annoyed me for me to say I liked it, but I didn't hate it either. I just think it could have been so much better had Carey had an editor with balls. It's always easier to rip apart what you didn't like than enumerate what you did, and I did NOT outline everything that I liked in the book here, so this review is a bit one sided.

What's written there is closer to 'Fedruh'.Edit x3:I stand corrected.I first encountered this book when I was much younger and just getting into Orson Scott Card's work - they're shelved next to each other in most bookstores and libraries, and after a while I got curious about the huge books with the rather prominently placed half-naked women on them. Reading the dust jackets, I concluded a few things: 1. that these were Sex Books; 2. that the main character would get raped, probably repeatedly; and 3. that they were not for me.I was, as it turns out, correct on all counts.A friend of mine convinced me to give them a shot this year, insisting that the political intrigue was fascinating and the sex wasn't that bad, really. I don't like gainsaying my friends, especially in an area where they objectively have more knowledge than I do, so I agreed, tracked down an ebook, and slogged through it. I came out the other side with... well, I guess I can argue back if anyone tries to convince me to read them again.There were two major disappointments for me in this book: court intrigue and consent. Consent is, obviously, the more important one, so let's talk about that first.One of the interesting things about this book is that it's written as if Phedre is looking back on the events of her life - there's a lot of \"if only I had known then\" which, believe you me, gets annoying. What this means, though, is that there's no room for character development to change perspective. The perspective of the narrator is that of adult Phedre and is cast as knowledgeable, omniscient as a result of hindsight. I mention this because, were this not the case, some of Carey's choices could be explained by Phedre's lack of knowledge or self-reflection in earlier stages of her life - but that's not an option.Maybe it's an asexual thing, to be hyper-tuned to situations of dubious consent and grooming? I definitely seem to be in the minority both here and with regards toDeathless; I can only guess that, because compulsory sexuality is so inherently threatening to me, it stands out more than it does for allo people?The Night Court runs on child grooming. They raise kids from infancy in a situation where sex work is normalized, start teaching them about it sometimes as young as six, and initiate them at 13. (not that they weren't sexual objects before then - a 10 year-old boy is once told that \"They'll be marking their calendars until you come of age\".) Now, here's the thing: I don't believe there's anything wrong with choosing sex work freely. However, the Night Court and its influence are coercive - we see this in Alcuin, who nearly gets himself killed trying to make his marque and get out of his contract, and earlier in a comment a Valerian House adept makes regarding the use of flechettes as a sex toy: \"He gave an involuntary tremor beside me and his voice changed. 'I hate them.'\" Both of these characters have clearly been put into sexual situations in which they weren't comfortable, and continued to participate as 'Servants of Naamah' nonetheless. That's coercion, not consent.And then there's Phedre, who gets pleasure in pain, and so whose contracts always include a safeword. Which she then never uses, even when a client burns her skin with a poker. The thing about this is - yes, technically speaking, it's possible for someone to have a safeword and never encounter a situation that crosses their boundaries. But that doesn't work here. This whole situation is constructed; Carey chose to give Phedre a safeword but never to show her using it. This means we never see her exercising control over her assignations, nor do we get a demonstration that the nobles of Terre d'Ange would actually respect her choice to end a scene/encounter. The safeword, unusedexcept for when Melisande orders her to use it, has no power.Finally: the handling of rape in this book. As I said, I anticipated it and rightly so, but what I didn't anticipate was Carey's choice to draw a division betweenkindsof rape.Minor spoilers: Terrible things happen and Phedre gets drugged by the series antagonist and sent to be a slave to the not!Germans over the border. Before she's sent away, though, the antagonist rapes her.Well. I say 'rape', because she wasdrugged and bound and never asked for consent, and because the sex was literally used as a coercive attempt to get information from her. What Phedre - and thereby Carey - says is this:What she did to me that last night... she would have ended it, if I'd given thesignale. I do believe that. It was my choice to withhold it.So, when someone feels they can't safeword out of a situation because of other pressures, that somehow becomes consensual? Since when is rape defined more by whether the attacker will stop if the victim gives them what they want, rather than by the fact that they started against someone's will in the first place?This is made worse by the way that Phedre's hindsight is used to emphasize it: \"It was my choice\". 'Choice' it might nominally be, but consent can't be freely given when the choice is weighted with the lives of people you love and the stability of an entire kingdom. 'Submit to assault or betray your friends and family' isn't a balanced decision at all.The entire setting is built on the idea of \"Love as thou wilt\" being the guiding precept of the land, and while I sort of see where Carey was going with that idea, it just wasn't carefully considered enough. (For a smaller example, as other reviewers have pointed out, 'whore' is still an insult in this culture even though one of their minor deities was literally a prostitute by trade.) If compulsory sexuality is a problem in the real world, it's even more so here, where everyone is expected to be just merrily fucking their way along. (Well - at least, the people we see most of are. Which are the nobles and wealthy merchants. Does 'love as thou wilt' extend to the peasantry? Does Carey care? We may never know.)Right. So. Consent: F-. Abject failure.On to the thing that persuaded me to read this book: the promise of court intrigue!I finally put my finger on why this book's 'intrigue' didn't work for me, and it's this: there's only ever one thing in play.Everyone wants the throne. Right. I get it. But because the major players all have one sole interest, they rarely interact in complicated ways - they're all just rivals for a single thing. Nobody is, say, out to get a better trade agreement with so-and-so, but will trade a favor for a favor even though they don't care about the rest. The 'machinations' at work here are ehh... I'd say maybe four steps at most? This is partly because none of them are playing within the system (if there is a system - we got very little info on the actual political structure of TdA) and they're all just gathering up armies to smash it from outside, but it just had no spark. The intrigue was, well, unintriguing. There's little more to say about it because it was just so damn shallow and dull.I'm still a bit iffy on giving this book two stars, but for the moment that rating stands. The reason for the second: the last quarter or so was pretty much straight up epic fantasy fare (clashing armies, desperate alliances) and that, despite everything else, was pretty enjoyable. Not that there weren't issues involved in those parts - see 'Phedre has hardly any close relationships that don't involve sleeping together' and 'sex is the solution to every problem' - but the pace picked up. So, extra star for that.Oh god, and before I end this review: the writing and the constant insistence that Terre d'Ange is the greatest thing that's ever existed, and all D'Angelines are supernaturally beautiful and no one else will ever be as pretty as them and blah blah fucking blah.

            "Translation failed for: 🎧 2nd Read, Dec. 2021 — 2 StarsThe fact that the author doesn’t have the DECENCY toat leastadmit that she was “inspired” by Sally Thorne’sThe Hating Gameis truly TRAGIC and beyond OUTRAGEOUS. I don’t think she ever went on record to address the issue. She namedMariana Zapata,Ella Maise, andTessa Baileyunder “influences” in her Goodreads author page, and I get it. In the case of this book, I can see how the influences manifest cause I’m no strangers to those authors’ works.MZ==> for the slow burn, the h’s inclination for long inner monologues, and the glaring proof that the book is 500 pages long.EM==> for the CHEESE and (simplistic/cringey) writing. I mean, from the writing alone, it feels like they’re literally the same person.TB==> for the steam, which isn’t exactly raunchy, but the H’s dominance in bed and dirty talk does up the steaminess a notch.I also watched a promotional video where she recommended her book for those who liked the movieThe Wedding Dateand the bookThe Unhoneymooners,and I GET IT. Obviously, both involve a wedding and fake dating. What I don’t get and most upset about is why she didn’t credit Sally Thorne when there’s clearly SOOO MUCH/MANY likeness between their books. Idk why I make such a big deal out of this when readers who’ve caught on to this didn’t, but it justdoespiss me off okay. 😭Before you attack me for re-reading a book I didn’t enjoy... (1) I didn’t know that I’d go from feeling meh about the book to outright rage and utter dislike. (2) I was adamant about re-reading it because they finally released the audiobook version, which I’m kinda known to be a fanatic of in general. Speaking of, I didn’t like the narrator, but the audiobook did make the writing sound less cringey. Talking about this book is not good for my blood pressure, so I’ll just ignore its existence from now on.📚 1st Read, May 2021 — 3.5 Stars“The Spanish Love Deception”???More like...The Aaron Blackford Invasion!!!Why is the hero such an angel???Isn’t he supposed to be grumpy???Why is he so ✦flawless✦ ???I swear, you read this book and watch him being as cool as a cucumber and as perfect as a cookie-cutter while leisurelybulldozinghis way into Catalina’s heart, like...THE ENEMIES TO LOVERS FARCEListen people, this is NOT enemies to lovers. It’s “I stupidly believe we’re mortal enemies because I heard you talked shit about me which hurt my feelings so bad I could never let it go for dear life - to - reluctant friends - to - stinking cute lovers.” The animosity is highly one sided, and ALL of it comes from the heroine. It’s CRYSTAL CLEAR from the very first page that our hero has always been into her. You can plainly see from the things he says and does, all the little quirks he notices about her, and every time she describes the on-going emotions on his features.I get that with the enemies to lovers trope we don’t always get real, thick, and pure hate between the leads. Sometimes it’s laced with judgement and false perception, attraction, lust, or a disguised love. Even so,I was momenteraly bewildered because I thought I’d be presented with characters who (if they didn’t hate each other, but either one or both of them actually secretly pined for the other) would at least ACT like enemies for approximately the first half of the book.It doesn’t help that Aaron is such a ~soft~ hero. I was wondering what had crawled up the heroine’s butt to detest him so much.As it turns out, she’s just sooo OBLIVIOUS and BLINDED by this...“Anyone but her, Jeff. Just not her. I don’t think I could take it. Is she even capable of taking on this project? She looks young and inexperienced.”— Aaronwhich admittedly, had it been me they talked about—I’m not so conceited to think that they were just intimidated by my talent and distracted by my beauty LOL—my immediate reaction would be feeling hurt, offended, and angry, too. That is it though, isn’t it??? This is a romance, and we know that he means he couldn’t afford the distraction working together would create. By the time the story takes place, it’s been one year and eight months. Some grudge you hold there, baby girl!THE CLOYING ROMANCEShe keeps treating him with hostility, and misinterprets everything he says. He neither encourages nor rerturns it, but continues to brush it off...“Because it was all you were willing to give me.

I should probably present you with all the proof, quotes, and whatnot to give some credibility to my words, but I’m unprepared. 🙈 This is already long as it is. Not to mention, for someone who’s read “The Hating Game” three times, I think I know.The mostdistinguishedelements that this book “has it going” are all the Spanish influences, the heroine’s traumatic past romantic relationship, and the female STEM representation.All of which I appreciated and had fun reading about immensely. Other than that, and I know this is no light accusation, I swear “The Spanish Love Deception” is imitating “The Hating Game” with or without it realizing to.THEROBOTICWRITINGI said earlier that the romance was corny, and I think it might be because of the bland writing. It’s not succinct and just so straightforward. Okay, I feel like those adjectives cancel out each other? But I mean, the writing is unimaginative.It lacks finesse.Even with the most run-of-the-mill moment...like, when Aaron brushes off a strand of hair out of the Lina’s face or swipes a chocolate stain off her mouth,there are ways to make those look interesting, enthralling, sexy, and swoony. However, the way the author describes them is *almost* cringe and eyeroll worthy.The heroine’s monologues are *almost* always longwinded, and the dialogues sometimes come off robotic. It’s like the characters are programmed to say them because they are “romantic.”It’s stated somewhere in the copyright section that the author designed the cover with Ella Maise, and I wonder if they took writing lessons together too because I feel like they have similar style—which is to say, not exactly my cup of tea. Though if asked, I like Armas’ better. It might be a hit or miss with her future books, but I’d love to see what she comes up with next regardless.“When I finally kiss you, there won’t be any doubt in your mind that it is real.”— AaronIn conclusion...I’m conflicted. Even though Catalina was stubborn for holding on to her grudges and so unaware of Aaron’s feelings, she learned her lessons. Even though Aaron was not a jerk like I expected him to be, I ~adored~ that he was the way he was. In other words, the characters won me over. Even though I think the romance was too clichéd, I also couldn’t help that sometimes it had me all up in my feels. Even though the writing was formulaic, I enjoyed it to the point of finishing the book in one sitting. I think my biggest issue was it hitting too close to “The Hating Game”—which is my favorite book; hence, me feeling territorial—for me to be able to love it completely., error: 🎧 2nd Read, Dec. 2021 — 2 StarsThe fact that the author doesn’t have the DECENCY toat leastadmit that she was “inspired” by Sally Thorne’sThe Hating Gameis truly TRAGIC and beyond OUTRAGEOUS. I don’t think she ever went on record to address the issue. She namedMariana Zapata,Ella Maise, andTessa Baileyunder “influences” in her Goodreads author page, and I get it. In the case of this book, I can see how the influences manifest cause I’m no strangers to those authors’ works.MZ==> for the slow burn, the h’s inclination for long inner monologues, and the glaring proof that the book is 500 pages long.EM==> for the CHEESE and (simplistic/cringey) writing. I mean, from the writing alone, it feels like they’re literally the same person.TB==> for the steam, which isn’t exactly raunchy, but the H’s dominance in bed and dirty talk does up the steaminess a notch.I also watched a promotional video where she recommended her book for those who liked the movieThe Wedding Dateand the bookThe Unhoneymooners,and I GET IT. Obviously, both involve a wedding and fake dating. What I don’t get and most upset about is why she didn’t credit Sally Thorne when there’s clearly SOOO MUCH/MANY likeness between their books. Idk why I make such a big deal out of this when readers who’ve caught on to this didn’t, but it justdoespiss me off okay. 😭Before you attack me for re-reading a book I didn’t enjoy... (1) I didn’t know that I’d go from feeling meh about the book to outright rage and utter dislike. (2) I was adamant about re-reading it because they finally released the audiobook version, which I’m kinda known to be a fanatic of in general. Speaking of, I didn’t like the narrator, but the audiobook did make the writing sound less cringey. Talking about this book is not good for my blood pressure, so I’ll just ignore its existence from now on.📚 1st Read, May 2021 — 3.5 Stars“The Spanish Love Deception”???More like...The Aaron Blackford Invasion!!!Why is the hero such an angel???Isn’t he supposed to be grumpy???Why is he so ✦flawless✦ ???I swear, you read this book and watch him being as cool as a cucumber and as perfect as a cookie-cutter while leisurelybulldozinghis way into Catalina’s heart, like...THE ENEMIES TO LOVERS FARCEListen people, this is NOT enemies to lovers. It’s “I stupidly believe we’re mortal enemies because I heard you talked shit about me which hurt my feelings so bad I could never let it go for dear life - to - reluctant friends - to - stinking cute lovers.” The animosity is highly one sided, and ALL of it comes from the heroine. It’s CRYSTAL CLEAR from the very first page that our hero has always been into her. You can plainly see from the things he says and does, all the little quirks he notices about her, and every time she describes the on-going emotions on his features.I get that with the enemies to lovers trope we don’t always get real, thick, and pure hate between the leads. Sometimes it’s laced with judgement and false perception, attraction, lust, or a disguised love. Even so,I was momenteraly bewildered because I thought I’d be presented with characters who (if they didn’t hate each other, but either one or both of them actually secretly pined for the other) would at least ACT like enemies for approximately the first half of the book.It doesn’t help that Aaron is such a ~soft~ hero. I was wondering what had crawled up the heroine’s butt to detest him so much.As it turns out, she’s just sooo OBLIVIOUS and BLINDED by this...“Anyone but her, Jeff. Just not her. I don’t think I could take it. Is she even capable of taking on this project? She looks young and inexperienced.”— Aaronwhich admittedly, had it been me they talked about—I’m not so conceited to think that they were just intimidated by my talent and distracted by my beauty LOL—my immediate reaction would be feeling hurt, offended, and angry, too. That is it though, isn’t it??? This is a romance, and we know that he means he couldn’t afford the distraction working together would create. By the time the story takes place, it’s been one year and eight months. Some grudge you hold there, baby girl!THE CLOYING ROMANCEShe keeps treating him with hostility, and misinterprets everything he says. He neither encourages nor rerturns it, but continues to brush it off...“Because it was all you were willing to give me.

            "Translation failed for: Contains minor spoilers and major spoilers which will be blocked off with 🦋🦋🦋I’ve got 3 questions after reading this book.1. Why was this book so cringe?2. Why did it get on my nerve more times than I can count?3. And why did I genuinely enjoy most of it?Subjective grade- 50%Plot - 55%Writing & dialogue- 75%Worldbuilding - 90%Character development - 45%Character relationships - 30%The school for good and evil follows best friends, Sophie and Agatha who like all children are shrouded in stereotypes. Sophie is your typical ‘girly girl'. She spends time on her looks and is made seem like a vain character in doing so. Can someone tell Chainani that skincare isn’t a shallow practice? Thank you.Agatha on the other hand is a typical ‘emo gyal’. Lives in a graveyard, only wears black, owns a cat and is said multiple freaking times that’s she’s ‘ugly’ (will expand on this more later.) Now, it comes as a surprise to both Sophie and Agatha that Agatha goes to the school of good while Sophie ends up in the school of evil. As if the way a person presents themselves is a sign of who’s good and evil?? All common sense aside, this was an alright book. Honestly, maybe I liked it because of how predictable it was and how all my guesses ended up true. Honest boost to my ego if I may say so, but this doesn’t compensate for all the problematic shit in this book.Now, as I said before Agatha is said to be an ugly person. Like whatever, societies beauty standards are boring so I never thought much of it. But when bippity boppity boop bitch comes along (and by that I mean the fairy godmother) she puts a spell of Agatha to make her look ‘more attractive’. Agatha, under the assumption she’s more attractive walks the school halls and everyone around her is all shocked and yada yada, very cringe. Turns out the spell was fake and she was attractive all along.Like what was the point of it all? God forbid there’s a non-attractive main character, we can't have that now, can we? Also, not till this point did the main love interest who was all up in Sophie even give her a glance. I wanted to throw my book into the Pacific Ocean because what?? We’re supported to think Tordo is a guy who wants people to look beyond his good looks and at his personality but the second an attractive girl comes around, he forgets about Sophie. Like ??? What a hypocrite.Plot:If I could sum up the first 50% of this book in one word it would be ‘denial’. They were in denial the whole freaking time. Like can’t Sophie accept she’s a bad person? Everyone else can see it, you’re not fooling anyone miss girl. I did enjoy this part of the book because it was so damn funny watching Sophie ace all her evil classes then turn around and swear she’s a princess. Got me cackling and everything. But the second half of this book felt more well woven. Once I passed the halfway mark, the plot was easier to enjoy.World building:Definitely my favourite part of this book. For such a complex world, it was well explained and I wasn’t confused (for the most part).Character development:Agatha’s character development felt more realistic than that of Sophies. She learnt to stand up for herself a little but that’s as far it went. But Sophie's character was just so confusing. Im getting migraines just thinking about her development.🦋🦋🦋There's no way Sophie went from trying to unalive Agatha to taking a fatal hit for her in a matter of minutes. Im sorry but that was such a forced character improvement.🦋🦋🦋 (end)Character relationship:HOLY SHIT DO I HAVE A LOT SAY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOKAgatha and Sophie.Let’s start there, shall we? So as an act of ‘kindness’ Sophie befriends Agatha who has no other friends. These two become close and stuff to the point where Sophie tells Agatha that she’s the only person who knows the real her or something along that line. This will be important in a second. Anyway, once the two girls get to their designated schools all Agatha thinks about is getting Sophie out safely and getting back home. But Sophie genuinely doesn’t give a damn about Agatha. All she cares about is going to the school of good so she can be with her Prince Charming uwu. At a certain point, Sophie gives up on the school of good and just wants to return home with Agatha. This is until her Prince Charming uwu notices her and she literally and I meanliterallyswats Agatha away like she’s a menacing fly. Sophie goes to justify her actions by saying Tedros is the only person who understands her. Do you see… what’s wrong with that????? Like miss girl, what?? And Agatha’s here about to break down crying & Sophie just does not care. This is such a toxic friendship, it needs to end.Sophie and Tedros’5-second relationship made me want to throw up. Like if I saw a couple like them in real life walking down a street, I wouldn’t even cross the road, I’d run, jump and skip in the opposite direction. They were dating for what, 2 weeks? And I’m being generous by saying 2 weeks. How in caldrons sake does Sophie think she’s in love? You’re not in love babes, trust me.Agatha and Tedros.Apparently, Agatha is one for leftovers but this is still not a cute relationship. She was literally bullied, BULLIED by this boy. He and his friends had a whole doll that looked like her that they were shooting with arrows. If that’s not a red flag, I don’t know what is.What I didn’t like in this bookI really don’t get whether the sexist and fatphobic remarks in this book is supposed to juxtapose society or if it's just the writers own opinion on those topics, but I really did not enjoy it. Sophie literally said she didn’t trust ‘fat’ people, made fun of a girl who genuinely thought of her as a friend because she was plus-sized and even insulted a lady in her town for eating a lot. Why were these comments even in this book? Like if it's supposed to suggest Sophie is fatphobic just say it once… these comments threw me off each time I read them.Overall, very odd book. Don't know whether I want to continue this series...2.4 stars 🦋, error: Contains minor spoilers and major spoilers which will be blocked off with 🦋🦋🦋I’ve got 3 questions after reading this book.1. Why was this book so cringe?2. Why did it get on my nerve more times than I can count?3. And why did I genuinely enjoy most of it?Subjective grade- 50%Plot - 55%Writing & dialogue- 75%Worldbuilding - 90%Character development - 45%Character relationships - 30%The school for good and evil follows best friends, Sophie and Agatha who like all children are shrouded in stereotypes. Sophie is your typical ‘girly girl'. She spends time on her looks and is made seem like a vain character in doing so. Can someone tell Chainani that skincare isn’t a shallow practice? Thank you.Agatha on the other hand is a typical ‘emo gyal’. Lives in a graveyard, only wears black, owns a cat and is said multiple freaking times that’s she’s ‘ugly’ (will expand on this more later.) Now, it comes as a surprise to both Sophie and Agatha that Agatha goes to the school of good while Sophie ends up in the school of evil. As if the way a person presents themselves is a sign of who’s good and evil?? All common sense aside, this was an alright book. Honestly, maybe I liked it because of how predictable it was and how all my guesses ended up true. Honest boost to my ego if I may say so, but this doesn’t compensate for all the problematic shit in this book.Now, as I said before Agatha is said to be an ugly person. Like whatever, societies beauty standards are boring so I never thought much of it. But when bippity boppity boop bitch comes along (and by that I mean the fairy godmother) she puts a spell of Agatha to make her look ‘more attractive’. Agatha, under the assumption she’s more attractive walks the school halls and everyone around her is all shocked and yada yada, very cringe. Turns out the spell was fake and she was attractive all along.Like what was the point of it all? God forbid there’s a non-attractive main character, we can't have that now, can we?

            "Translation failed for: \"Now I see why you two are friends,\" the prince says to the main characters Sophie and Agatha.But... wait! I want to raise my hand and ask, \"Tell me why they are friends!\"This is a problem considering the story hinges on this main point. While Sophie and Agatha are supposedly the best of friends, the character development doesn't show how this happens. When Agatha and Sophie first meet, Sophie isn't Agatha's friend and she says so; she realizes Sophie's just using her. Sophie is beautiful, shallow, and narcissistic. Sophie wants to go the School of Good and Evil where two children are kidnapped every year from her village later to be found in a fairy tale storybook. She believes she will find her prince at the School of Good and live \"happily ever after.\" Agatha is the perfect villain for the School of Evil, Sophie thinks, because she is ugly, lonely, and isolated, and Sophie thinks if she's with Agatha her chance of being chosen will be more likely. When Sophie is kidnapped (just as she wants) Agatha tries to rescue her and in the process the two end up at the school except Sophie doesn't go to the School of Good, she ends up in the School of Evil, while Agatha is dumped in the School of Good.The two misfits continue to be friends but mainly because Agatha pursues it the most. She goes to extremes to rescue Sophie and it never made sense to me given Sophie's quickness to betray Agatha at every turn and Agatha's dislike for her at the beginning. Sophie and Agatha are superficial and flit between wanting beauty on the outside to beauty on the inside. Agatha says in the beginning that beauty is temporary but later confesses she thinks it brings happiness. Sophie believes only in beauty with no understanding of ugliness that comes from hate. Her personality struck me as psychopathic, probably because she resembled the murders I just read about in a nonfiction book called, \"Greed, Rage, and Love Gone Wrong: Murder in Minnesota,\" by Bruce Rubenstein. She cheats, murders, and lies with no remorse and Agatha goes along with her because she is her only friend. Sophie's dumber than a doorknob most of the time before transforming into a mastermind villain at the end. An explanation for her surge of brainpower is given, but it felt contrived. The characters are stereotypical and wishy-washy for a good portion of the novel. They start to come together at the end but I wasn't vested in their development because it took too long.The bag of mixed messages continues with the prince, Tedros, who loves one and then the other meanwhile badmouthing each when dating the other girl. He seemed pretty hypocritical to me when he says to Sophie she's a terrible friend because she uses her friends, betrays them, calls them fat, and liars. He too, is prejudiced toward others, lies, and betrays people who are different. The seesaw continues as Agatha hounds Sophie to impulsively kiss Tedros immediately and then lectures her later for not making a plan of attack to kiss him. Teachers are like caricatures that don't offer words of advice. For instance, when Agatha and Sophie are punished by the teachers in burning shoes until the girls want to die, I thought it focused on the cruelty of the teachers versus the girls argument. The teachers are mostly idiots throughout the story with no control of students. When some teachers impart a few words of wisdom at the end, it seemed out of character and too late. I also didn't like the message that failure is unacceptable and students who failed were dealt an awful fate. Failure is difficult to deal with and those who failed were the kids the author kills off the most.The ending and what it suggests might offend some. I won't give it away but I didn't see that coming. It is one of many reasons it is better for older students. Some of the plot is predictable such as the love triangle, but there were also some interesting twists such as when Sophie has to deal with a duplicate of herself in class creating an introspective moment. Unfortunately there were too few of these occurrences which makes the book fall short of its potential. Transitions were confusing at times such as when Sophie and Agatha would talk to each other in mirrors. I seemed to always be rereading those parts because I didn't' realize they were looking at their reflection to see the other. The action scenes and magic is very creative and I enjoyed these parts.There is a reader prophecy and riddle. The prophecy didn't seem necessary to the plot because it wasn't told until the end. The overarching theme of good and evil in human nature fell flat because the characters weren't complex enough. The stereotypes enforced in this book are my biggest complaint. That ugly people aren't happy unless they are beautiful, that a girl isn't happy unless she has her prince, that girls only think of boys, that a fat person has no friends, that a married person isn't happy. Some of these are refuted at the end but it comes too late. Or perhaps the author is trying to do too much. At one point Sophie tries to rally the villains into having hope and feeling good about themselves. At first her advice surrounds just superficial beauty before turning toward what it means to accept oneself, but the message never gets delved into because the plot suddenly shifts into a Dark Lord hullabaloo; thus, losing the opportunity to dig deeper into this theme. This book's potential isn't reached and it is a shame because it is an interesting premise and creative fantasy. Maybe the sequel will pull it all together., error: \"Now I see why you two are friends,\" the prince says to the main characters Sophie and Agatha.But... wait!

            "Translation failed for: Listen, don't gild me but I didn't like this installment as much as I wanted to. So, before I'm cast out let me explain:1. We suddenly get so many different POV narratives. Queen Kaila, Slade, Osrik, Rissa, Auren... I just didn't like it. If this had been a consistent factor in all of her books, maybe I would have liked it more, but this was not the original style of this series and I didn't enjoy the constant jumping back and forth.2. I also have to say that while I did enjoy some of the character backgrounds we got, especially for Rip, I felt it was kind of misplaced. The fourth installment of a series seems a bit late to start building up a character that has been the main focus for the past two books. It just felt like this effort to explain Rip to us came a little late but in full force. So many chapters are dedicated to showing us his childhood and I don't know, it just felt off for me.3. I did not care for this Rissa- Osrik arc at all. It was misplaced and misguided in my opinion and made no sense at all. Also, it was incredibly unoriginal, because basically, it is just a repetition of Rip and Auren in the second book. He gives her a nickname, practically sleeps next to her, and is all cocky and sexy, while we're supposed to see Rissa, who for three books was a strong, but nasty and self-centered woman, as a delicate and almost helpless little thing, who only wants to be free. It felt forced and I cannot stress how absolutely unnecessary and misplaced this romance was.This brings me to my main complaint about this book: for the most part, this story is not a continuation of the cliffhanger from the third book but goes in a completely different direction. I've already mentioned in my review of the third book, that I had to be honest and say there really wasn't all that much story and plot development going on. To be brutally honest, I felt like most of the book was kind of unnecessary and could have been shortened down to fit into the second installment. And I have to say, this trend continues. My kindle version of this book has 705 pages and I believe that I had to reach about page 500 until the story picks up and even then, it's not really a lot that is happening. What did I get for those 500 pages? Slade whining about almost rotting Auren. Auren whining about pretty much everything. Osrik lusting after Rissa. Digby being overly fatherly. Ryatt yelling at Slade to stop moping. Lu and Judd being nothing but comic relief. Oh yes and a whole lot of kinky, overly explicit sex. Because it's important to say that fae can be overly animalistic, dominant, and lustful creatures. Does this move the plot along? No. Is it relevant to the story? No. Is it really necessary? Again, no. But it fills lots and lots of pages.Now if the story would move along and we'd get all this kinky sex, I would have been fine. But after more than 500 pages of nothing happening, I was tired. I mean, what are the unresolved issues from the third book?- Midas, King of the Sixth Kingdom is dead. Who will take over?- Fifth kingdom is left without a king. Who will take over?- Third kingdom wants to claim Sixth, how's that going? We don't know.- Auren is accused of stealing Midas' power and all hell is about to break lose. Should we deal with that? Nope, it's more important we have Auren behave like a petulant child for hundreds of pages. It's more important to have Slade fall into self-pity and then fae-horniness. It's more important to have Auren sunbathe and discover all kinds of fun characters in fourth's capital than to actually get to work on how to prevent an all-out war. And after everything that this series has built up, this was really really disappointing.I also have to say that while in the third book I at least had the characters I enjoyed immensely to make up for this lack of story, I can't say the same for this book. It was all just too much personal drama. Slade is no longer this powerful, feared commander and king. He is a horny dirty talker who whines a lot. Osrik is what Slade was two books ago. Auren is still horribly stupid and behaves like an annoying brat a lot. Ryatt makes no sense to me. Lu and Judd are no longer badass and just the funny sidekicks.When I finally reached the end of this book (and yet another cliffhanger...) I was not excited. I was not on the edge of my seat and I doubt I will be as enthusiastic about a fifth book. Frankly, I don't understand why we can't just end this series. For two books, we've barely had any story at all. Hundreds of pages drag out maybe 100 pages worth of story. I think this series could have done with a whole lot more editing because I find 5 books (or more?) for this story just way too much. If all the diplomatic intrigues, the wars and battles and conflicts would get developed and turned into an epic man vs fae type war, it could have been enough for so many installments. But the way the way these past two books have dragged on with barely anything happening, I doubt the fifth one will pick up the pace and deliver the action-packed sequel I have been pretty much waiting for ever since the second book., error: Listen, don't gild me but I didn't like this installment as much as I wanted to.

            "Translation failed for: I could not wait for the release of this book and had been counting down the days until I could immerse myself in this world again. Unfortunately, this instalment simply did not deliver.- Nothing happens in the first 500 pages of the book. Nothing. Yes, Auren grows into herself and starts overcoming her trauma, but it’s very poorly executed. She holds no animosity towards Slade for what he did to her (despite him taking away her free will at the end of book three) and the only thing she’s worried about is the sliver of his rot that is left within her… only to barely play a role at all throughout the book until the very end. (Which, I’m calling it, she either held on to herself because she loves even that part of him, hence it being in her heart, or is in her because she’s pregnant.)She’s scared of her magic, then she’s afraid to face that she can’t use her magic, and as soon as she reconciles the two within a few chapters, she can suddenly use ALL the magic without having to break a sweat. It felt too easy. At no point of the first 75% of the story were there any stakes… because of course everyone chose to simply ignore the giant elephant that was everyone accusing Auren of stealing magic! Because that makes sense of course and is what a monarch in charge of a whole kingdom would do. Duh!There really could have been so many things going on to drive the plot. Auren being accused of stealing magic, the food supply being cut off, the power plays needed to replace the lost kings… all these things could have provided so much friction, made for an interesting and complex and engaging story! Instead, there was nothing really happening until the last 20% of the book, because the MCs decided to bury their heads in the sand and simply ignore the world around them… for over 500 pages. And even then, when we actually do reach the “plot” part of the story, I am very disappointed that Auren doesn’t drive any of it. Things continue to happen to her rather than due to her actions and choices. Which is very disappointing considering that the whole purpose of the series is for her to come into her own agency, which she supposedly does in this book… I don’t see how, though, when she’s continuously a victim trying to react to the situations thrown at her rather than the one causing them. She didn’t even choose to attend the Conflux at the end - which would have made sense given her emotional development at the time. No, she had to be kidnapped!- There were also at least a couple of deus ex machina moments thrown in too, though more so on Slade’s side when inevitably trying to rescue Auren from all the things happening to her.- While I love Slade, his character definitely took a hit between this and the last book, though there were a few memorable moments and interactions between him and Auren (especially after the second and before the third time they slept together - when she asked if this is what love is and he confirmed, and when she told him she wanted to explore the world and other people and he was all for it whilst making it clear that he would still ultimately be endgame because… he said so). He most definitely did not act like the calculating king/commander that he was in the previous books. While I liked his softer side, it was a bit too guilt ridden for me. And when it came to Auren he was more shortsighted than a 15 year old whose girlfriend called him up to tell him that the house was empty… all he cared about was Auren, whilst claiming that he always did what’s best for his people. That was simply not true, and, in fact, some of his decisions were so callous that I truly wondered how his Wrath had not put him straight yet. Ryatt was the only voice of reason in this, and even he somehow came to admit that he was wrong by the end… it was just… disappointing, because it shows an inability of the author to balance and explore more complex issues and dynamics.- The attempt at creating an interesting sibling dynamic between Slade and Ryatt failed. The whole thing was underexplored and underdeveloped. Given that nothing was happening in the first 500 pages of the book, more emphasis could have been given to this. There was plenty of opportunity.- There was absolutely no point to including a new budding romance. It was clear that it was only inserted because the author new that this particular dynamic worked, as proven by the fact that it was a copy paste of Auren and Slade’s relationship in book 2. Only worse, because apart from insta lust, this was also insta love (cue: Osrik’s reaction to the stabbing). Can’t complain too much though! At least Osrik in this book was closer to what Slade used to be!- Just like the sex in the last book, the sex scenes in this book were fucking weird. At least the first two out of four times they slept together in this book. The crudeness of the sex just didn’t fit the remaining tone of the book, especially since we witnessed both Auren and Slade’s first person POV and got used to their thought patterns and expressions. It doesn’t fit the characters and where they were supposed to be emotionally and physically in these moments. Which is sad, really, because it greatly subtracts from the value of the story and the reader’s experience. It simply cheapens the book. And this is coming from someone who enjoys a lot of explicit smut in my reads. But the sex was more befitting of a mafia romance than a fantasy romance, and it’s clear that the author has more experience with the one than the other. By the third scene, it got better. But the first two scenes still left a foul taste behind.- Still, looking forward to the last book in the series., error: I could not wait for the release of this book and had been counting down the days until I could immerse myself in this world again. Unfortunately, this instalment simply did not deliver.- Nothing happens in the first 500 pages of the book. Nothing. Yes, Auren grows into herself and starts overcoming her trauma, but it’s very poorly executed. She holds no animosity towards Slade for what he did to her (despite him taking away her free will at the end of book three) and the only thing she’s worried about is the sliver of his rot that is left within her… only to barely play a role at all throughout the book until the very end. (Which, I’m calling it, she either held on to herself because she loves even that part of him, hence it being in her heart, or is in her because she’s pregnant.)She’s scared of her magic, then she’s afraid to face that she can’t use her magic, and as soon as she reconciles the two within a few chapters, she can suddenly use ALL the magic without having to break a sweat. It felt too easy. At no point of the first 75% of the story were there any stakes… because of course everyone chose to simply ignore the giant elephant that was everyone accusing Auren of stealing magic! Because that makes sense of course and is what a monarch in charge of a whole kingdom would do. Duh!There really could have been so many things going on to drive the plot. Auren being accused of stealing magic, the food supply being cut off, the power plays needed to replace the lost kings… all these things could have provided so much friction, made for an interesting and complex and engaging story! Instead, there was nothing really happening until the last 20% of the book, because the MCs decided to bury their heads in the sand and simply ignore the world around them… for over 500 pages. And even then, when we actually do reach the “plot” part of the story, I am very disappointed that Auren doesn’t drive any of it. Things continue to happen to her rather than due to her actions and choices. Which is very disappointing considering that the whole purpose of the series is for her to come into her own agency, which she supposedly does in this book… I don’t see how, though, when she’s continuously a victim trying to react to the situations thrown at her rather than the one causing them.

What is Starcrossed about, you ask. Starcrossed is the story of a painfully shy, socially inept girl who meets a really hot boy with whom she feels an instant ‘connection’ even though they must stay away from each other for fear that one of them may kill the other. However, this (seemingly insurmountable) problem is soon solved when girl and boy save each other’s lives, thereby easing the path to true luurve. The boy has a large, close-knit family, some of whom are warm and welcoming while the others are hostile and suspicious of the girl. The girl, unbeknownst to her, has been super-speshul all her life, but neither this, not her stunning beauty (of which she is also largely unaware) has catapulted her to fame and popularity. In short, she is a wallflower who likes to hide behind her hair. (I wonder if her hair, too, smells of strawberry shampoo? *random Twilight factoid*)Anyway, moving on, boy and girl do, of course, fall in love, but they can NEVER be together! Or at least, not without causing the destruction of all human civilisation! (Wow, I knew teenage dating was a minefield, but this is the first time I’ve heard of it being a nuclear warhead!) Of course, boy’s family are very different from the rest of their kind, they don’t believe in killing, except in self-defense, and have moved into a small town to avoid the rest of their clan, who are rabid, psychotic killers. Blessed with extraordinary good looks and great athleticism, the boys of the family are all star footballers.Where there is true love, of course, there must be danger. There are a whole bunch of people out to get the girl, including a very dangerous member of boy’s psychopathic extended family. So while girl is busy debating whether boy likes her, since he is making no moves towards her, boy’s cousin is hunting down girl. Girl is being protected by stalker-ish members of boy’s family. Until girl finds out that boy has vowed never to touch her, goes off in a snit, gets attacked, gets rescued, sneaks boy upto her room while oblivious single father watches TV and declares her love, only to find out the shattering truth that keeps them apart.Sounding familiar yet?Yeah, so basically, this is fanfic. This is what you get when a Twifan decides, why don’t I make Bella and Edward demigods instead of vampires? Why don’t I flip it a little and see what happens if it’s Bella who has the bloodlust and the super-powers right from the beginning? And while I am at it, why don’t I sell my fanfic to a publisher for a million dollars or so? After all, there are over 15 million people worldwide jonesing for a Twilight fix, so I might as well cash in while Smeyer is busy writing about An Alien Called Wanda.But here’s the deal; this is not a badly written book. I would rate it slightly higher on technique than Twilight. And there are parts where the book gets positively interesting, before she ruins it altogether, but more on that later.Five reasons why Starcrossed is better than Twilight:1. The love interest is a teenager the same age as the heroine. No immortal hundred-year old with an inexplicable penchant for cradle-snatching here!2. Nobody falls in love with their food.3. No love triangle (thus far!)4. Greek mythology!!! (even fake Greek mythology is better than fake vampire lore)5. Claire, the heroine’s best friend, is an actual character, as opposed to a cardboard cutout like whatsherface Angela. (Although the constant references to her height and her fierceness and her hurriedly put-together chemistry with Jason were sort of boring.)Unfortunately, the unmistakable resemblance to Twilight sort of killed every other thought in my brain for the duration of this book. It’s not just that the larger plot structure reminded me of Twilight; it’s also very many, many small details. Like Helen’s habit of hiding behind her hair. Like Helen’s brand of awkward, insecure social interaction. Like how she logs on and Googles all the suspicious paranormal people stalking her. Like the fact that Helen’s dad is a single father who spends most of the book watching sports on TV and being away on work at all the crucial times. Like the fact that Helen is so modest she can’t change in front of another girl. Like the fact that Lucas has a loving, close-knit family with a sister who is a seer and can see the future. Like the fact that there is a scene with a car crash from which Lucas emerges unscathed. Like the fact that Lucas manages to sneak into her bedroom without her father knowing, andlies on top of the bedcoverswhile she lies under them; in fact there is one scene where she brushes her teeth in the bathroom and gets ready quickly for bed while Lucas is waiting for her in the bedroom, then goes to the head of the stairs and yells goodnight to her father, who is watching sport on TV. My memory may be at fault, but isn’t there theEXACT. SAME. SCENEin Twilight?Also there are several points in the book where Angelini seems to be trying too hard to refute the fact that she is writing Twilight fanfic. There are references to stalker-ish men, and women who do what they’re told because their men wanted them to, and both characters claim that they don’t indulge in such behaviour. Helen’s best friend is all like, oh you have superpowers, you must be a vampire. And then there are corny vampire jokes. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.The only thing this book has in common with the Percy Jackson series is that they are both vaguely based on Greek mythology. And Angelini twists the myths beyond recognition in an attempt to make them fit the parameters of the story. A simple Wiki search would tell her that Helen had no dealings with Aphrodite. And that Paris was the one caught in Aphrodite's clutches. Not to mention the fact Helen is directly descended from Zeus, owing nothing of her conception to Aphrodite. I'm not saying, read the Iliad, but at least read Wikipedia!! And all of her demi-gods are so super, super, SUPER speshul, with a vast array of supernatural knuckle dusters, that even the gods would have difficulty surpassing them! Wish fulfillment much?So anyway, I’m breezing along, trying to get Robsten’s faces out of my head, feeling my usual illicit thrill at the idea of star-crossed lovers, when I get to a point in the book that’s actually sort of thrilling, and doesn’t remind me of any other work of fiction. I start to think that maybe there’s some hope for Angelini, after all. And then what does she do?She channels Cassandra Clare! Yes, Cassandra Clare! A fanfic tribute to the queen of fanfic? Aaaargh! Thankfully, she doesn’t leave us, the readers, in suspense for long, even if her characters are going to be tortured for the next two books, at least!As if it’s not enough that Zeus, the Furies and the Fates are conspiring to keep these two desperate lovers apart, she decided she needed to toss the kitchen sink at them as well!So why two stars? One star for the fact that the book is written moderately well and paces itself decently; one star for the fact that I get an illicit thrill out of the we-can-never-be-together, no-we-WILL-be-together-against-all-the-odds, i-will-mope-and-only-be-an-empty-shell-if-you-abandon-me plotline, despite the sneers from my saner, feminist alter ego!So if you hate Twilight and Twilight fanfic, or you know, badly-researched literature, stay away from this book. If you’re a Twifan desperate for another dose, rush to the stores and pre-book your copy now! If you’re like me and couldn’t care less either way, well, we can band together and nitpick!, error: **EDIT: I originally gave this book three stars, simply because it is based on Greek mythology, and I've had a love affair with Greek mythology since I was a kid. However, upon further consideration and a sudden recall of my Homer and Bullfinch, I am forced to concede that the Greek Mythology in this book is about as authentic as cranberry sauce in a can. So, only two stars, and I'm STILL being generous!Two Twifans are walking down the street to the cinemaFangirl 1:ZOMG, I h8 steffie meyer! Y hasn’t she written more Twilight buks alredy? I miss edwrd, n bella is so cool, zomg, I jus cnt get enuf of her!Fangirl 2:Did u see the trailer fr breaking dawn? Omigod, arnt Robsten the cutest couple eva?

Oh I cnt w8 2 read dis!...and that is why, ladies and gentlemen, Josephine Angelini will be laughing her way to the bank in a couple of months, when the book comes out!I think I would have enjoyed this book more if the soundtrack of Bella’s Lullaby hadn’t been running in my head the whole time. What is Starcrossed about, you ask. Starcrossed is the story of a painfully shy, socially inept girl who meets a really hot boy with whom she feels an instant ‘connection’ even though they must stay away from each other for fear that one of them may kill the other. However, this (seemingly insurmountable) problem is soon solved when girl and boy save each other’s lives, thereby easing the path to true luurve. The boy has a large, close-knit family, some of whom are warm and welcoming while the others are hostile and suspicious of the girl.

This miserable sourpuss atheistic type author guy Maurice meets this hot slutty (their word) woman Sarah who is married to England’s most boring civil servant Henry. They have a full on steamy affair right under Henry’s nose for four years and are very happy, except Maurice gives the impression that even when he’s happy he’s miserable. Like Morrissey. Similar name. Anyway, it’s World War 2 and there’s a big air raid and the guy goes downstairs to check on the cat or something and WHAM a great big German missile hits the building and a door falls on him. Sarah runs downstairs and sees his arm sticking out and thinks he’s dead. She runs back upstairs and prays to God. So far so reasonable. But actually she doesn’t believe in God. Well, people do strange stuff when they think their true love is dead under a door. She says if God makes Maurice not be dead then she will a) believe in God and b) give up Maurice. So when he wanders into her room all covered with dust and saying wow I just got hit by a door, I thought I was a goner but I just got a headache, how about that, she immediately thinks that God did it. She instantly takes it for a Miracle and not just a near-miss. And that’s the last she sees of him, she cuts him off without a word of explanation, thus plunging them both into suicidal despair. (What she says is “Love doesn’t end just because we don’t see each other.” Well, maybe, but shagging surely does.)(Sample quote from Maurice after Sarah dumps him :I thought : hating Sarah is only loving Sarah and hating myself is only loving myself.Yes, it’s psychobabble 20 years before the term was invented. )I suppose Sarah thinks that if she breaks the promise to God not to see him, then God will smite him completely dead with another door or handy piece of furniture. But this is not explained.But hey, this was a promise made under duress. And anyway, if she just takes a moment to think, she will surely realise that during any air raid on London in the War, and any air raid anywhere at any time, many people will have prayed to the God they actually believed in that their loved ones would not die and many people will then have found their loved ones had died in horror and agony nevertheless. And some like her would find their loved ones had survived. So where’s the logic in that? Well, there isn’t any. It’s just human nature. Unless we can conjecture that God sits there saying oh, that’s a good prayer, very well expressed, very sincere, I’ll answer that one. But those prayers are rubbish, cliché ridden, boring, really very bad, so those loved ones will have to fry.So I figured that this dame was not at the front of the queue when they were handing out brains.Actually, all these reasonable points are made by a Rational Atheist character who she goes to see to try to get him to argue her out of this insane piece of magical thinking. Oh the vow, the vow to the non-existent God! But it doesn’t work : “his fanaticism fixed the superstition deeper”. By the way, the Rational Atheist has a big Facial Disfigurement, which has Blighted his Life. I think this is some kind of symbol.Then we get Sarah’s diary and the full horror of her mind is laid bare. She loves Maurice, no, actually, she hates him. No, she loves him. But she hates God. No, she doesn’t believe in him. Oh wait, she loves God, who she doesn’t believe in. And she thinks she’s a Catholic (no other varieties are available in Graham Greene’s universe – Methodism or Zoroastrianism don’t get a look in). She thinks she might be a Catholic but she doesn’t believe! Hold the phone, yes she does. God! No God! Oh the pain! The pain! Love, hate, hate, love, belief, maybe – wah wah wah.

            "Translation failed for: Love is in the air--or maybe anxiously repressed--in February and my romantic literature jag continues withThe End of the Affair, the 1951 doomed romance by Graham Greene. This was my first exposure to Greene's fiction and while I was struck by the celebrated British author's intricate prose, keeping time like a Swiss clock, this novel is deficient in story, forgoing action for the reflections of its melancholy male narrator. These musings proceed from revealing to unceasing and finally, I just wantedThe End of the Affairto end. The experience of reading this book was like listening to a 192-page voice mail message from an ex-boyfriend who hasn't moved on.The story begins on\"a wet black January night on the Common, in 1946\"with our narrator, successful novelist Maurice Bendrix, signaling a fellow Londoner he recognizes in the rain. The man is Henry Miles, a civil servant whose contribution, as Bendrix sees it, is moving from assistant secretary in the Ministry of Pensions to assistant secretary in the Ministry of Home Security. Bendrix invites Henry for a drink out of morbid curiosity for news of Henry's wife Sarah, his ex-lover who Bendrix hasn't seen since June 1944 and never gotten over. Bendrix is full of barely repressed antipathy, both for Sarah and her pathetic husband, but as an author, is valued by Henry as a listener.Unable or unwilling to consider that Bendrix's friendship with his wife might have developed into a love affair, Henry invites Bendrix to his home while Sarah is out for a walk. He confides that he's been deeply troubled by the fear that his wife might leave him. He shows Bendrix a letter in which a friend recommends a private detective. Bendrix offers to handle the transaction, musing\"Jealous lovers are more respectable, less ridiculous than jealous husbands. They are supported by the weight of literature. Betrayed lovers are tragic, never comic.\"Henry burns the letter and tells Bendrix to forget it, but the writer has memorized the Vigo Street address of the private detective.What an odd collection the trusted professions are. One trusts one's lawyer, one's doctor, one's priest, I suppose, if one is a Catholic, and now I added to the list one's private detective. Henry's idea of being scrutinized by the other clients was quite wrong. The office had two waiting-rooms, and I was admitted into one. It was curiously unlike what you would expect in Vigo Street--it had something of the musty air in the outer office of a solicitor's, combined with a voguish choice of reading matter in the waiting-room which was more like a dentist's--there wereHarper's BazaarandLifeand a number of French fashion periodicals, and the man who showed me in was a little too attentive and well-dressed. He pulled me a chair to the fire and closed the door with great care. I felt like a patient and I suppose I was a patient, sick enough to try the famous shock treatment for jealousy.After his interview with the private detective, Bendrix returns home and is notified by his landlady that he received a call from Mrs. Miles. Meeting for lunch, Bendrix compels Sarah to join him at Rules, their old restaurant. Sarah asks Bendrix to look her husband up occasionally, concerned he might be lonely. Bendrix manages to keep his bitterness under wraps, advising her to see a doctor for a cough he observes. He notices a man with a young boy in tow watching him and upon returning home, Bendrix is called on by this man, whose name is Parkis and has been assigned by the detective agency to report on Sarah's coming and goings.Bendrix recalls being introduced to his beautiful and charming ex-lover by her husband, who he'd met at a party in the summer of 1944 and is curious to study for a future book. He invites Henry's wife to dinner for the purpose of picking her brain about her hapless civil servant husband. Walking Sarah down Maiden Lane to the tube station, Bendrix delivered a fumbling kiss without any expectation of going to bed with her. When the author invites Sarah to a screening of a movie based on one of his books, she comes without Henry. At dinner afterward, Maurice and Sarah fall in love over a bowl of onions.Exempted from military service due to a bad leg, the war in Europe becomes a backdrop for Bendrix's obsession for Sarah, which proceeds through the air raids on London in June 1944. The lovers share little concern of their passion being exposed to Henry, but is tempered by their realization that ultimately, the affair will come to an end. Mr. Parkis determines that Sarah has been stealing away to an apartment at 16 Cedar Road. Bendrix learns that the tenant is a street preacher named Richard Smythe. Studying a diary which Parkis gets his hands on, Bendrix discovers Sarah is hardly carrying on an affair with Smythe, but seeking spiritual salvation.He is jealous of the past and the present and the future. His love is like a medieval chastity belt; only when he is there, with me, in me, does he feel safe. If only I could make him feel secure, then we could love peacefully, happily, not savagely, inordinately, and the desert would recede out of sight. For a lifetime perhaps.If one could believe in God, would he fill the desert?I have always wanted to be liked or admired. I feel a terrible insecurity if a man turns on me, if I lose a friend. I don't even want to lose a husband. I want everything, all the time, everywhere. I'm afraid of the desert. God loves you, they say in the churches, God is everything. People who believe that don't need admiration, they don't need to sleep with a man, they feel safe. But I can't invent a belief.Graham Greene writes with precision in the way he considers jealousy, with the corporeal and spiritual costs of a romance in which nothing is ever enough for one man. Even when playing out against atmospheric conditions like the rain and fog on a London winter, or an air raid with V1 rockets raining down on the city during one rendezvous, the novel's busiest activity takes place in the souls of the lovers. This approach might be most satisfying to those who enjoy introspective novels.

The religious discussions made me feel like I was holding a chisel against my head and the author was hammering it.The film industry has returned to Graham Greene for material for nearly as long as there's been a film industry andThe End of the Affairhas been adapted to film twice. In 1955, a U.K. production directed by Edward Dmytryk starred Deborah Kerr as Sarah Miles, Van Johnson as Bendrix and Peter Cushing as Henry Miles. In 1999, Columbia Pictures mounted a version adapted and directed by Neil Jordan featuring Ralph Fiennes as Bendrix, Julianne Moore as Sarah Miles and Stephen Rea as Henry Miles. Perhaps intending to appeal to the same audienceThe English Patient, I far prefer that film's embrace of an affair during wartime rather than religious screed., error: Love is in the air--or maybe anxiously repressed--in February and my romantic literature jag continues withThe End of the Affair, the 1951 doomed romance by Graham Greene. This was my first exposure to Greene's fiction and while I was struck by the celebrated British author's intricate prose, keeping time like a Swiss clock, this novel is deficient in story, forgoing action for the reflections of its melancholy male narrator. These musings proceed from revealing to unceasing and finally, I just wantedThe End of the Affairto end. The experience of reading this book was like listening to a 192-page voice mail message from an ex-boyfriend who hasn't moved on.The story begins on\"a wet black January night on the Common, in 1946\"with our narrator, successful novelist Maurice Bendrix, signaling a fellow Londoner he recognizes in the rain. The man is Henry Miles, a civil servant whose contribution, as Bendrix sees it, is moving from assistant secretary in the Ministry of Pensions to assistant secretary in the Ministry of Home Security. Bendrix invites Henry for a drink out of morbid curiosity for news of Henry's wife Sarah, his ex-lover who Bendrix hasn't seen since June 1944 and never gotten over. Bendrix is full of barely repressed antipathy, both for Sarah and her pathetic husband, but as an author, is valued by Henry as a listener.Unable or unwilling to consider that Bendrix's friendship with his wife might have developed into a love affair, Henry invites Bendrix to his home while Sarah is out for a walk. He confides that he's been deeply troubled by the fear that his wife might leave him. He shows Bendrix a letter in which a friend recommends a private detective. Bendrix offers to handle the transaction, musing\"Jealous lovers are more respectable, less ridiculous than jealous husbands. They are supported by the weight of literature. Betrayed lovers are tragic, never comic.\"Henry burns the letter and tells Bendrix to forget it, but the writer has memorized the Vigo Street address of the private detective.What an odd collection the trusted professions are. One trusts one's lawyer, one's doctor, one's priest, I suppose, if one is a Catholic, and now I added to the list one's private detective. Henry's idea of being scrutinized by the other clients was quite wrong. The office had two waiting-rooms, and I was admitted into one. It was curiously unlike what you would expect in Vigo Street--it had something of the musty air in the outer office of a solicitor's, combined with a voguish choice of reading matter in the waiting-room which was more like a dentist's--there wereHarper's BazaarandLifeand a number of French fashion periodicals, and the man who showed me in was a little too attentive and well-dressed. He pulled me a chair to the fire and closed the door with great care. I felt like a patient and I suppose I was a patient, sick enough to try the famous shock treatment for jealousy.After his interview with the private detective, Bendrix returns home and is notified by his landlady that he received a call from Mrs. Miles. Meeting for lunch, Bendrix compels Sarah to join him at Rules, their old restaurant. Sarah asks Bendrix to look her husband up occasionally, concerned he might be lonely. Bendrix manages to keep his bitterness under wraps, advising her to see a doctor for a cough he observes. He notices a man with a young boy in tow watching him and upon returning home, Bendrix is called on by this man, whose name is Parkis and has been assigned by the detective agency to report on Sarah's coming and goings.Bendrix recalls being introduced to his beautiful and charming ex-lover by her husband, who he'd met at a party in the summer of 1944 and is curious to study for a future book. He invites Henry's wife to dinner for the purpose of picking her brain about her hapless civil servant husband. Walking Sarah down Maiden Lane to the tube station, Bendrix delivered a fumbling kiss without any expectation of going to bed with her. When the author invites Sarah to a screening of a movie based on one of his books, she comes without Henry. At dinner afterward, Maurice and Sarah fall in love over a bowl of onions.Exempted from military service due to a bad leg, the war in Europe becomes a backdrop for Bendrix's obsession for Sarah, which proceeds through the air raids on London in June 1944. The lovers share little concern of their passion being exposed to Henry, but is tempered by their realization that ultimately, the affair will come to an end. Mr. Parkis determines that Sarah has been stealing away to an apartment at 16 Cedar Road. Bendrix learns that the tenant is a street preacher named Richard Smythe. Studying a diary which Parkis gets his hands on, Bendrix discovers Sarah is hardly carrying on an affair with Smythe, but seeking spiritual salvation.He is jealous of the past and the present and the future. His love is like a medieval chastity belt; only when he is there, with me, in me, does he feel safe. If only I could make him feel secure, then we could love peacefully, happily, not savagely, inordinately, and the desert would recede out of sight. For a lifetime perhaps.If one could believe in God, would he fill the desert?I have always wanted to be liked or admired. I feel a terrible insecurity if a man turns on me, if I lose a friend. I don't even want to lose a husband. I want everything, all the time, everywhere. I'm afraid of the desert. God loves you, they say in the churches, God is everything. People who believe that don't need admiration, they don't need to sleep with a man, they feel safe. But I can't invent a belief.Graham Greene writes with precision in the way he considers jealousy, with the corporeal and spiritual costs of a romance in which nothing is ever enough for one man. Even when playing out against atmospheric conditions like the rain and fog on a London winter, or an air raid with V1 rockets raining down on the city during one rendezvous, the novel's busiest activity takes place in the souls of the lovers.

At times the story seemed to get bogged down and Ms. Stiefvater's normally melodic prose became a little heavy handed. And while the alternating narrative added depth to the story, it occasionally made for some bumpy transitions. Again (yes, it happened in all three books). But most of these things are forgivable as, overall, Ms. Stiefvater's writing is lovely and the world she created is vivid and alive.So why the two stars? Well, now we get to the unforgivable stuff. For starters, everything worked out a little too neatly and yet, surprisingly, there were some plot threads left completely and utterly abandoned.First, let's take the situation with Grace's parents. There's zero resolution with them. None. It seemed as though there might be some, but it never quite got there and eventually the entire thread was simply dropped. Not fair, Ms. Steifvater, just because you paint yourself into a corner doesn't mean your audience should suffer. Get a grip, figure it out, spend more time in re-writes, don't just toss it away because it's more convenient that way. That's simply cheating.Second issue: the wolves. There's a hugely dramatic scene at the end of this novel, with an aerial hunt involving Mr. Culpeper. Wolves are killed. We learn of two characters that were definitely killed off and others eluded to, but it's unclear who survived. This left me scratching my head and feeling, again, a little cheated.

In one breath seeming to overcome his trauma and heartbreak, and in the next he's moping and griping that his life is worthless without Grace. In this installment he's reached a whole new level of morose and it's not very becoming. Ms. Stiefvater, you've turned Sam from sweet and affectionate to sadly pathetic. In your words, in this novel, Sam is truly a leaky womb.Fifth: Officer Koenig (introduced briefly in Shiver). Eleventh hour he just strolls up and says \"Hi Grace and Sam, why don't you and your werewolf buddies mooch off me for the rest of your lives at this sweet little resort I own miles from nowhere\"? And there's no explanation/motivation to save the wolves other than his moderate dislike for Culpeper. This stretches the bounds of plausibility to a whole new level. And, oh, what's that you ask?

The characters reap rewards they have neither struggled for nor earned. They are subjected to hardships that simply vanish with no plausible explanation. They encounter tumultuous relationships which conveniently vanish into the ether. They are ostensibly left squeaky clean, because they did nothing to earn the grit they should have been slathered in.

The joy was not solely due to the dynamics between the two, but because I enjoyed watching them struggle and evolve independently of each other.

            "Translation failed for: I have to write this review, even though it hurts.Jameswas one of my most anticipated releases of 2024. You guys know I typically don't anticipate books at all. But this year both Danez Smith and Rémy Ngamije are blessing us with new books, so I actually took some time to look into other books that would be published this year. This is how I came to hear ofJames. Everyone and their mamma was raving about this newHuckleberry Finnretelling, how funny it is, how clever, how perfect. This book has an 4.65 (!!!!) average rating on Goodreads. In reviews, people act like Percival Everett is the second incarnation of Christ himself. To say that I was HYPED for this book is an understatement. I was so ready to love it!Sure, I had some questions as to whyHuckleberry Finnwas chosen in the first place, as it's quite the progressive text, and despite its flaws, Jim is a well-fleshed out character, but I love seeing Black people thrive so I was more than willing to go on this ride. Turns out all of ya'll are liars, and this is actually not only one of the worst books I've ever read, it's also one of the most useless retellings. Jean Rhys is turning in her grave because she does not want to witness this. Anyways, to bring some order into this chaos, I actually decided to split this review into different sections and talk about what I liked (not much, welp) and what I didn't (brace yo'self).Writing styleLet's start light because writing style is always hella subjective BUT I reaaaally didn't vibe with Everett's writing style. It is sooo straight-forward and simple, I cannot deal with it. James is a 300-page novel and I'm convinced I read it within 4-5 hours, and I am a very slow reader. It went by so quick??? And that's because 80% of this novel is dialogue. Everett doesn't know what descriptions are. You can flip to any random page and all you will see is dialogue. And I know some of you will actually like the book for it – and I respect that – but I want more pomp, more introspection, more landscape... just MORE.I also really didn't think that this was funny. Sure, I laughed maybe 3 times, but overall, this is not written with aaaany humor. \"The correct incorrect grammar\" did nothing for me, Huck being unable to understand Jim when he spoke standard English did nothing for me... it really wasn't giving. They have this one stupid exchange: Huck: \"Why are you talking like that?\" Jim: \"Are you referring to my diction or my content?\" And I really just hate it, because NO ONE is talking like that. It's so over the top and silly.And it's really such a shame because I LOVE the first sentence of this novel: \"Those little bastards were hiding out there in the tall grass.\" It's sooo good, and could've set the tone for an essential piece of rewriting... alas!CharacterisationWhew, chile. This is the big one. The reason why I was interested in this retelling thatJamesis supposed to be, is to get more insight into the characters we already know from Twain's novel; mainly, of course, James. The TITULAR character. Who is this man? What motivates him? What are his fears, his desires, his struggles? Why is he the way that he is? Percival Everett never manages to make him come off the page. At the end of this book I'm none the wiser. I don't know who this man is. At the beginning of the book (p. 35) there's this beautiful quote:\"I was as much scared as angry, but where does a slave put anger? We could be angry with one another; we were human. But the real source of our rage had to go without address, swallowed, repressed. They were going to rip my family apart and send me to New Orleans, where I would be even farther from freedom and would probably never see my family again.\"Unfortunately, this is one of the only moments of introspection we get in this whole 300-page long novel. Everett never makes us feel Jim's fears or his anger. It's a damn shame. I didn't really care what was happening to him, and that's a feat in and of itself, because terrible fucking things were happening to him... I wasn't able to connect to any other characters either, welp.What Everett does to his female characters is truly mind-boggling. None of them are well fleshed out. All (!) of them are used as devices to fuel Jim's story along. I'm truly baffled that very few reviewers seem to have a problem with that. Let's start with Jim's wife Sadie and his daughter Elizabeth. We as readers never get to know them. All we're supposed to know about them is that Jim loves them and wants to reunite with them. They are simply used as a motivation for Jim to run away and his desire to free them. We never explore their relationship and bond. Especially with a reveal that comes later in the book (I'll talk about it in the last section of this review due to spoilers), I felt like we really needed to explore his marriage better... because WTF? What did Sadie say to all of this? When and how did she and Jim get together?But most appalling are Everett's use of Sammy and Katie. Sammy is a young Black woman that Jim and Norman free during one of their stops. Sammy reveals to them that she was repeatedly raped by her white overseer since she was a child. Something that is just so so horrible and it actually made me close the book for a second because I really struggle with reading about such heavy topics. But instead of giving Sammy's characters any purpose, Everett has her shot 10 pages later during their flight, only for Jim and Norman to have a conversation about freedom, with Jim spewing the bullshit that at least now she \"died free\". Excuse me? That death is the best she could've hoped for? Fuck that!I felt a similar rage when Everett introduces the character of Katie, only for Jim to witness her being raped by the white overseer Mister Hopkins. That made me so damn mad. First of all, why did you have to describe her rape in detail on the page?? Just exploitative and unnecessary. And why don't you give this woman any thoughts, any story beyond this? I kid you not, she is simply introduced to be raped, so that Jim can muster up the courage/find the rage to murder Hopkins afterwards. It is so uncomfortable.Plot/Narrative devicesThe plot was pretty cheap with Jim going from A to B to C, always encountering shitty people along the way, but I guess the original wasn't much more original in that regard either. So whilst the plot wasn't engaging for me, the thing that really didn't work for me were the narrative devices that Everett was using. I just didn't like them. I didn't like Jim's dream-conversations with the philosophers. I get they were there to show the hypocrisy in philosophical thought but they were NOT funny, and there were decidedly too many of them. I didn't like that the big reveal (of how Jim and Huck are linked) came so late in the book, it should've been revealed way earlier in order for Everett to explore it further. I also really didn't like the pacing and felt like the truly exciting stuff happened during the last 20 pages when Jim finally got to the plantation where his wife and daughter were enslaved. I really liked that bit.Purpose/IntentionI'm just really confused by Everett's intention. Whatwasthe purpose of writing this novel? Parts of it are supposed to be realistic (historical fiction) but then there are other parts that are so fucking unrealistic, but Everett never truly leans into magical realism/fantasy. I feel like he truly missed the mark. In regards to the ending, I love that Jim became an avenger, or how he said it: \"I am the angel of death, come to offer sweet justice in the night. I am a sign. I am your future. I am James.\"I'm sure it's not just me but I find novels/fiction set during the time of enslavement to be really hard to stomach. I can watch documentaries all the time and am willing to learn and educate myself, but fiction can quickly feel exploitative. That's why I love authors who are willing to take a risk and shake things up a bit. A perfect example would be Wayétu Moore'sShe Would Be King. The novel reimagines the foundation of Liberia, but instead of solely focusing on the horrors and the plight of Black people, Wayétu gives some of her Black characters special powers, like superhuman strength or invisibility, which empowers them (and the reader), and makes reading the story bearable and triumphant. Everett tries the same with the ending, with pistol-swinging James freeing all the slaves from the plantation, and I loved that bit (as unrealistic as it was, that's the kinda shit I wanna see!!!), but it feels lacklustre because the rest of the story is not that. It almost comes out of nowhere.In terms of purpose, I also feel likeJamesadds almost nothing of substance to Twain'sHuckleberry Finn. The only thing (SPOILER INCOMING) is the reveal that Huck is Jim's son. There are parts of that that I like (first and foremost, it explains why this Black enslaved man takes so many risks/sacrifices so much for this random \"white\" boy in Twain's novel) but there are more parts that I don't like (Why wasn't colorism explored then? Why did we never get a look at Jim's relationship to Huck's mom? WHO WAS THIS WOMAN? I desperately need to know, but Everett never answers these questions...). It was just really poorly done.You guys know how much I love books written in the literary tradition of writing back. Jean Rhys'Wide Sargasso Seaand Daoud'sMeursault, contre-enquêteadd so much to their source materials (Jane EyreandL'Étrangerrespectively). They take characters that are on the fringes of these narratives and finally give them a voice. I don't feel like Everett's James is much louder than Twain's Jim, or more human than him. Not that much was added to his character. Reading this actually has me convinced that we need a feminist retelling for Huck's mom. Ahhhh.Anyways, I ordered another retelling last week –The Silence of the Girls– let's hope it's better than this., error: I have to write this review, even though it hurts.Jameswas one of my most anticipated releases of 2024.

And that's because 80% of this novel is dialogue. Everett doesn't know what descriptions are. You can flip to any random page and all you will see is dialogue. And I know some of you will actually like the book for it – and I respect that – but I want more pomp, more introspection, more landscape... just MORE.I also really didn't think that this was funny. Sure, I laughed maybe 3 times, but overall, this is not written with aaaany humor. \"The correct incorrect grammar\" did nothing for me, Huck being unable to understand Jim when he spoke standard English did nothing for me... it really wasn't giving. They have this one stupid exchange: Huck: \"Why are you talking like that?\" Jim: \"Are you referring to my diction or my content?\" And I really just hate it, because NO ONE is talking like that. It's so over the top and silly.And it's really such a shame because I LOVE the first sentence of this novel: \"Those little bastards were hiding out there in the tall grass.\" It's sooo good, and could've set the tone for an essential piece of rewriting... alas!CharacterisationWhew, chile. This is the big one. The reason why I was interested in this retelling thatJamesis supposed to be, is to get more insight into the characters we already know from Twain's novel; mainly, of course, James. The TITULAR character. Who is this man? What motivates him? What are his fears, his desires, his struggles? Why is he the way that he is? Percival Everett never manages to make him come off the page. At the end of this book I'm none the wiser. I don't know who this man is. At the beginning of the book (p. 35) there's this beautiful quote:\"I was as much scared as angry, but where does a slave put anger? We could be angry with one another; we were human. But the real source of our rage had to go without address, swallowed, repressed. They were going to rip my family apart and send me to New Orleans, where I would be even farther from freedom and would probably never see my family again.\"Unfortunately, this is one of the only moments of introspection we get in this whole 300-page long novel. Everett never makes us feel Jim's fears or his anger. It's a damn shame. I didn't really care what was happening to him, and that's a feat in and of itself, because terrible fucking things were happening to him... I wasn't able to connect to any other characters either, welp.What Everett does to his female characters is truly mind-boggling. None of them are well fleshed out. All (!) of them are used as devices to fuel Jim's story along. I'm truly baffled that very few reviewers seem to have a problem with that. Let's start with Jim's wife Sadie and his daughter Elizabeth. We as readers never get to know them. All we're supposed to know about them is that Jim loves them and wants to reunite with them. They are simply used as a motivation for Jim to run away and his desire to free them. We never explore their relationship and bond. Especially with a reveal that comes later in the book (I'll talk about it in the last section of this review due to spoilers), I felt like we really needed to explore his marriage better... because WTF? What did Sadie say to all of this? When and how did she and Jim get together?But most appalling are Everett's use of Sammy and Katie. Sammy is a young Black woman that Jim and Norman free during one of their stops. Sammy reveals to them that she was repeatedly raped by her white overseer since she was a child. Something that is just so so horrible and it actually made me close the book for a second because I really struggle with reading about such heavy topics. But instead of giving Sammy's characters any purpose, Everett has her shot 10 pages later during their flight, only for Jim and Norman to have a conversation about freedom, with Jim spewing the bullshit that at least now she \"died free\". Excuse me? That death is the best she could've hoped for? Fuck that!I felt a similar rage when Everett introduces the character of Katie, only for Jim to witness her being raped by the white overseer Mister Hopkins. That made me so damn mad. First of all, why did you have to describe her rape in detail on the page?? Just exploitative and unnecessary. And why don't you give this woman any thoughts, any story beyond this? I kid you not, she is simply introduced to be raped, so that Jim can muster up the courage/find the rage to murder Hopkins afterwards. It is so uncomfortable.Plot/Narrative devicesThe plot was pretty cheap with Jim going from A to B to C, always encountering shitty people along the way, but I guess the original wasn't much more original in that regard either. So whilst the plot wasn't engaging for me, the thing that really didn't work for me were the narrative devices that Everett was using. I just didn't like them. I didn't like Jim's dream-conversations with the philosophers. I get they were there to show the hypocrisy in philosophical thought but they were NOT funny, and there were decidedly too many of them. I didn't like that the big reveal (of how Jim and Huck are linked) came so late in the book, it should've been revealed way earlier in order for Everett to explore it further. I also really didn't like the pacing and felt like the truly exciting stuff happened during the last 20 pages when Jim finally got to the plantation where his wife and daughter were enslaved. I really liked that bit.Purpose/IntentionI'm just really confused by Everett's intention. Whatwasthe purpose of writing this novel? Parts of it are supposed to be realistic (historical fiction) but then there are other parts that are so fucking unrealistic, but Everett never truly leans into magical realism/fantasy. I feel like he truly missed the mark. In regards to the ending, I love that Jim became an avenger, or how he said it: \"I am the angel of death, come to offer sweet justice in the night. I am a sign. I am your future. I am James.\"I'm sure it's not just me but I find novels/fiction set during the time of enslavement to be really hard to stomach. I can watch documentaries all the time and am willing to learn and educate myself, but fiction can quickly feel exploitative. That's why I love authors who are willing to take a risk and shake things up a bit. A perfect example would be Wayétu Moore'sShe Would Be King. The novel reimagines the foundation of Liberia, but instead of solely focusing on the horrors and the plight of Black people, Wayétu gives some of her Black characters special powers, like superhuman strength or invisibility, which empowers them (and the reader), and makes reading the story bearable and triumphant. Everett tries the same with the ending, with pistol-swinging James freeing all the slaves from the plantation, and I loved that bit (as unrealistic as it was, that's the kinda shit I wanna see!!!), but it feels lacklustre because the rest of the story is not that. It almost comes out of nowhere.In terms of purpose, I also feel likeJamesadds almost nothing of substance to Twain'sHuckleberry Finn. The only thing (SPOILER INCOMING) is the reveal that Huck is Jim's son. There are parts of that that I like (first and foremost, it explains why this Black enslaved man takes so many risks/sacrifices so much for this random \"white\" boy in Twain's novel) but there are more parts that I don't like (Why wasn't colorism explored then? Why did we never get a look at Jim's relationship to Huck's mom? WHO WAS THIS WOMAN? I desperately need to know, but Everett never answers these questions...). It was just really poorly done.You guys know how much I love books written in the literary tradition of writing back. Jean Rhys'Wide Sargasso Seaand Daoud'sMeursault, contre-enquêteadd so much to their source materials (Jane EyreandL'Étrangerrespectively). They take characters that are on the fringes of these narratives and finally give them a voice. I don't feel like Everett's James is much louder than Twain's Jim, or more human than him. Not that much was added to his character. Reading this actually has me convinced that we need a feminist retelling for Huck's mom. Ahhhh.Anyways, I ordered another retelling last week –The Silence of the Girls– let's hope it's better than this. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

I had dealt with YA creepers such as Edward Cullen and YA douchebags such as Jace Lightwood/Wayland/whatever before, but none of them had ever driven me so mad...the actual review: penned after I'd finished the bookRating: 2.5 stars for this book.Let me tell you once more that at the beginning, I had expected myself to like this book, the writing is quite good even though I have my doubt about the subject matter:\"What? That dude kidnaps this girl and he expects her to love him? And it's supposed to be a Young Adult book?!\"To be honest, the plot of Stolen sounds more like those online erotica which I can easily found on many different NC-17 websites.So, how does the story actually turn out?In fact this is a difficult book to rant,I like the opening of the story, and Gemma, the kidnapped victim's struggle to grip onto her sanity and how she made her final decision. I also like the author's description of wildness of the Australian Outback. These are the bright-spots of the book. Plus I appreciate the author for NOT sugarcoating Ty, the kidnapper into some dreamboat or attractive bad boy, in fact she had made it quite clear that what the kidnapper did was wrong.However, I'm pissed off that in the middle of the story, the author had made a handful of clumsy attempts to draw readers' sympathy to Ty by giving him one big fat sorry-ass backstory.I'M VERY SORRY, BUT YOU CAN'T JUSTIFY KIDNAPPING AND STALKING WITH A BAD, FUCKED UP CHILDHOOD,PERIOD. I REFUSE TO BUY THIS GUILT TRAP, MS. CHRISTOPHER!I'm equally pissed off by how unrealistic many of the details and setting are in the book. The author, Ms. Christopher had made Gemma's kidnapping in Bangkok airport and she being spirited away to the Australian Outback soundways too easy.Plus I can't believe Ty, an orphan who had been fending for himself ever since he was 19 years old could somehow manage to buy a farmhouse and stored whatever food and supplies he needed in it. Not only buying the farm, Ty, a homeless teenager, somehow also managed to afford staying in British for years and stalking Gemma in his spare time, AND he also managed to afford buying plane tickets, fake ID, fake passport and a truck for his kidnapping plan. Wow, none of these seem to be realistic to me.Gemma and Ty's characters also do nothing to redeem this story for me. Although I appreciate Gemma for not giving up and actually fighting back, still from start to end I don't have a grip on her personality and for many times she comes off as a bit of a whinny. She seems to be unhappy with her life, her parents and friends but she never clearly explains what her problem with them is,SO WHAT IS SHE COMPLAINING ABOUT ANYWAY!?On the other hand, Ty makes me so mad that I want to knock his skull in while screaming\"DIE! FUCKER, DIE!\"for being such a totally selfish and creepy kidnapper.WHO ARE YOU? WHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO KIDNAP A GIRL SO YOU CAN *SAVE* HER FROM HER FAKE, PATHETIC LIFE!!!????I don't care if a kidnapper cried in his sleep, I don't care whether he is emotionally vulnerable or not, I only care about him lying to a girl and telling her that her parents are selfish and don't love her enough to come looking for her; I only care about him being arrogant enough to think he can steal a girl and CHANGE her for the better. And because he is such an irredeemable fucker, I find it unacceptable for Gemma to moon over Ty, his well built body and the supposed \"wonders\" he had showed her. She really disgusted me at this point.I also can't stand Ty's cornering Gemma by surrounding the farm with chicken's fences like he is trapping some animal.Goodness, this fucker makes me sick.Therefore you can imagine how much shock I was inwhen I saw on discussion board that some readers actually blame Gemma for being \"heartless\" toward Ty. OMG! WHAT ALTERNATIVE UNIVERSE ARE YOU FOLKS LIVING IN!?Aside from Ty's unacceptable behaviors, I also don't think Ty's character is well built, and as a kidnapper he isn't even realistic. It looks like the author couldn't decide what to do with him, therefore sometime he becomes this lonely lost boy who only wants Gemma's company, sometime the author seems to want us to feel bad for Ty even though his actions (lying to Gemma about her parents, stalking her, forcing her to do things she doesn't want to, etc) show that he clearly has the making of a cold blooded criminal. Damn, that's so messed up.Last but not least, Stolen is supposed to be a long letter written by Gemma to Ty, but this \"letter format\" writing doesn't work. Gemma's voice sounds too cool, level-headed and distant, which doesn't look convening given how much the girl had gone through.Once again, I suggest you to readThe Collectorinstead. It's a much worthy read.PSS: A wonderful article by a fellow Goodreads friend:http://openmindedskeptic.blogspot.hk/..., error: Pre-review:I must confess, I'm still in the middle of the book and I'm already at the verge of giving up.Stolen: A Letter to My Captorannoys me so much.At first I thought I'd like this story, because I'm deeply interested with Stockholm Syndrome and the conflicts between kidnapped victim and the kidnapper...and not to mention I had also tried my hand on writing yaoi fanfic with similar themes.

            "Translation failed for: This is a series that has been on my to-read list for years as it is well loved by the vast majority of my Goodreads friends. I decided to finally make a start to it since the Netflix TV adaptation is due later in 2019. Reading book series before watching the TV adaptations worked out fantastic for me with Game of Thrones and Altered Carbon. Sadly, The Last Wish was a bit of a flop. I still think Netflix might get an OK TV series out of this but only if the use the concept as a basic template because the plots, worldbuilding, and the characters in this book were lacking anything deep or original.I must admit to being a bit wary going into The Last Wish as I knew in advance it was a collection of short stories focusing on the adventures of the Witcher, Geralt. Generally I prefer serial to episodic as a story format. My feeling is the former offers the chance to tell a deeper more compelling story. Surprisingly I ended up having a bunch of issues with the book but the short story format was not one of them. I felt like Andrzej Sapkowski did a good job of giving the various short stories a coherent structure. It started with a short story of Geralt battling a monster and then recovering from his injuries in a temple. While he was recovering he reminisced about other times in his life. The result was we got a bunch of short stories that got broken up by brief flashbacks into the \"present\" of the story. I felt that really worked!The stories in this collection follow the adventures of Geralt, a Witcher, as he travels the land taking jobs as a sort of monster slaying mercenary. The Witcher moniker is more than just a title though as Geralt has some magical ability of his own as well as a few (as yet unexplained) mutations that make him a bit more than human. The premise was OK in theory but the story itself fell flat as pretty much everything about it was lacking.The worldbuilding was OK but never quite managed to be anything special or particularly interesting. The fantasy setting here was pretty generic of any fantasy series that use fairytales as the building blocks. Some of the creatures and stories were mildly interesting but there was absolutely nothing here that was in any way original. I've read this all before and often in a lot slicker fashion in a bunch of other books and series over the years. The Witchers had potential but the truth is we learned very little about them in this collection.The characters were also a massive problem. Geralt was bland and completely throwaway. Each short story could have featured a different Witcher or random lead character and it would not have hurt this book in the slightest. Geralt had little in the way of personality and I never had any reason to get emotionally invested in his character in the early to middle parts of the book. By the end he was still bland but by then I actively disliked him. There were only two support characters of note in Dandilion and Yennifer. Both characters sucked and I hated them from the get go. Both were awful people so it was impossible to invest in them as characters I was supposed to be rooting for. It was impossible to invest in Dandilion after he tried to use two wishes tokill a rival and magically rape a woman that had caught his eye. What a piece of shit!. Yennifer was almost as bad.One thing I never noticed in any of the reviews I read for The Last Wish was the disturbing nature of the main characters and a few of the stories. I was expecting some old school misogyny and flat characterisation given that this is basically a no brain, action based, monster squashing anthology and we definitely got both those things with this one but I was caught out by some of the more disturbing elements of the story. Geralt was basically a fantasy version of James Bond. So this story had a lot of the same issues as Bond in the way that the female characters were just sex objects for Geralt to leer at or fuck his way through. That was mildly annoying but fairly standard stuff for anyone who has read any old school fantasy. More disturbing was the fact that the very first short story started with Geralt leering at a sexualized 14 year old girl! On top of that we had theattempted magical rape by Dandilion and an actual magical rape perpetrated by Geralt at the end of the book via his \"last wish\" as well as Yennifer's mind rape of a bunch of the characters. I'm honestly not sure what Sapkowski was aiming for with this stuff, maybe it was a shitty attempt at humour? If so it fell flat and the fact that Sapkowski never sold any of this stuff as a problem disturbed me. How are we meant to root for characters who are worse than most villains I've come across? You may think that is not a problem as morally grey characters are all the rage nowadays but it actually is a problem in this story as these guys are being sold to the reader as characters we are supposed to like and root for. I ended with the feeling that Sapkowski and I had a very different view of morality mostly due to the fact that he was trying to sell me Jamie Lannister like he was Clark Kent. It was bizarre! Then there was the cringe-inducing fact that all woman sorcerers were bitter ugly woman who used magic to enhance their beauty at the cost of their reproductive organs shrivelling away to nothing. That was creepy and fucked up!All in all I was really disappointed by this one as my pre-read expectations had been pretty high due to all the hype and love this series enjoys. Perhaps I struggled with this more as I have never played any of the computer games so came with no inbuilt positive inclinations or nostalgia? I ended up a bit sad all I got was a fairly generic throwaway fantasy book that was hindered all the more by the inclusion of a few more disturbing elements.I'm not sure if I'll press on with this series or not. Normally I'd just pull this plug at this point but I've definitely read worse over the years and that Netflix TV adaptation is still looming along with the claim (from all and sundry) that the series really gets better when the series arc kicks in on the third book.Rating: 2.5 stars.

            "Translation failed for: –2.5 starsFirst of all I want to say that I think it's unfair that this book is in the GCA Semifinals in Young Adult Fantasy when it hasn't even released yet. GR messing up these awards every year is nothing new, but it still bugs me. A book that has been released for months now, should be able to have that spot. I would have said this regardless if I likedThese Violent Delightsor not, I just think other books that have already been released may deserve the exposure more.Edit: Not surprise that it didn't make it into the final round, cause how? No one has read it. This book should have been included in the awards for next year likeThe Queen of Nothingis this year, but it's GR so it will never make sense 🤷🏽‍♀️***R E V I E WTake this review with a grain of salt, because lately I can't seem to enjoy any book. My concentration span in quarentine is around 10 minutes max. If my attention is not catch by that time, it's lost. That being said I'm someone who under normal circumstances gets easily bored. 🙈So far there are way more positive reviews forThese Violent Delights, so I'm pretty sure that I'm the odd one here and have anunpopular opinion.

Is this a lie or the truth? Is this a ploy or your heart reaching for me?”↳PLOTThese Violent Delights is set in 1926 Shanghai. The city is unofficially divided into two territorties. One belongs to theScarlet Gangand the other belongs to theWhite Flowers. These two rival gangs have been ruling Shanghai with an iron fist since forever. Now a madness is spreading throughout the city with members of both gangs dying by clawing out there throats. The story is all about finding the monster who is spreading this madness around the city. ThereforeJuliette Cai, heir of the Scarlet Gang, andRoma Montagov, heir of the White Flowers, have to work together to find a cure.↳WHAT WAS MEH:I'm partly to blame, because I'm putting too much hope into the romance aspect of these young adult fantasy books when it's not the focus of the story. I've only readthis heart-stopping debut is an imaginative Romeo and Juliet retelling\"and knew I had to read this book.. Romeo and Juliet?? Sign me up!A love like theirs was never going to survive in a city divided by hatred.Juliette and Roma are in rival gangs–forbidden aspect? check.They have a past together, but then they betrayed each other–angst? check.Reunited to work together to solve a mystery–yearning and longing? check.On paper everything looks great, but the excecution was lacking and I know that it's partly on me and expecting to much of a romance in a book where it's not the main focus. The romance is a very small subplot. For a good amount of the times Juliette and Roma don't have scenes with each other, but are with their respective gang. The romance aspect didn't really start until maybe the last third of the book. The longing and yearning I was hoping fore was almost non-existent. Every time they had a scene together, I felt exactly nothing.. where was the angst?One would think there would be so much tension leading to the explanation of the betrayal, but it wasn't. The Romeo and Juliet retelling was disappointing, not even the names that were almost the same could help.“Just leave me here,” he said with a groan. “How are you this bad?” Juliette asked in disbelief. “I thought you were Russian.”“I am Russian, not an alcoholic,” Roma muttered.The romance can not be great, if half of ship is totallyBLAND. I see this trend in YA books where the heroine is this kickass and powerful characters and then there is the Hero who just breathes and does nothing ordinary. That's Roma for you. As the heir of the White Flower he has to act tough, but he's acutally such a softie which is fine, but why couldn't he be more exciting???!!! Only for a little.I don't know if it's inteded or not, but Juliette character arc was pretty fleshed out. We got all her thoughts on colonialism, backstory on how she was send to the US for educational purposes, her dynamics with her cousins and parents and her place in the gang. Compared to Juliette Roma was background noice. There was not much on his background and if this is something that is more explored in the next book, then I apologize in advance for critisizing this.“So you,” Roma went on fiercely, “cannot fool me any longer. You are the same indomitable girl I would have laid my life down to save. I made my choice to believe in you—now you make yours. Will you keep fighting, or will you crumble?”Speaking of characters, this book had quite a few, but the most important one next to Roma and Juliette were their cousins. Roma closest relationships are with Benedikt and Marshall, while Juliette is pretty close with her cousins Kathleen and Rosalind. While I love reading about different family dynamics/relationships I didn't care enough about any of them. For that reason it was boring to read the chapters where Kathleen/Rosalind/Benedikt/Marshall were wandering around Shanghai trying to help.And then there is the plot, I wasn't very fond of. The whole \"running around Shanghai finding the monster who spreads the madness\" plot was not going anywhere. There were a couple subplots that started, but got lost somewhere. It's annoying how in most YA fantasy books for 80% of the book nothing really happens. The characters run around in circle and accomplish next to zero and in the last few chapters everything happens at once. Twist left and right and then the book ends when it is at its peak! 😬“I am more concerned with why people were tearing their throats out in this house in the first place—”“It’s the madness,” Juliette interrupted. “It’s here, and it could be a viral contagion. We need to ask the other maids who were in contact with the victims to remain in their rooms for a few days.”To read about these things during this year. Not that great. It's not the author's fault tbh, cause I doubt she knew what was coming when she wrote this book.↳WHAT WORKED WELL:“My name was too Chinese for the West,” Juliette continued, a wry smile on her lips. She didn’t know why her face had morphed itself into amusement. She was anything but amused. “You know how it is—or maybe you don’t. A temporary thing for a temporary place, but now the temporary thing is burrowed in so deep it cannot be removed.”Colonialism plays a huge part and Chloe Gong did a great job of portraying this. Foreigner like the British, French, Russians etc. were all over Shanghai to a point were the main character Juliette felt like a stranger in her own country. She came back to Shanghai after her parents send her abroad to study in the US. Now that she's back, Juliette's trying to navigate life. Other themes like racism and sexism were explored in this book too.The Chinese had built the pit, gathered the wood, and lit the match, but it was the foreigners who had come in and poured gasoline upon every surface, letting Shanghai rage into an untamable forest fire of debauchery.Juliette shading white people and hating on white supremacy throughout the entire book? LOVED THAT. Just things I love to read about and one of the biggest reasons I could push through this book.It was the entitlement that drove these men forward. Entitlement that encouraged their wives to place a delicate handkerchief to their nose and sniff, wholeheartedly believing the tirade was deserved. They believed themselves the rulers of the world—on stolen land in America, on stolen land in Shanghai. Everywhere they went—entitlement.Juliette was avery relatablecharacter for me. Even though, Juliette is the heir to the Scarlet Gang, she had to work extremely hard to get where she is now. Juliette is tough and dangerous to prove to her parents and all the other gang members that she can get the job done. Tyler, one of her counsins, is trying to get Juliette's position, therefore Juliette has to work harder not to make any mistakes and prove that she's the right heir to the Scarlet Gang. As an asian kid, I think, a lot of people will be able to relate to her character to a degree. Having to work harder to prove your parents that you're getting shit done. Otherwise they still treat you like a kid even though you can be 30 or 55.Books that end with a cliffhanger are always the worse. I didn't expect anything less from this book, but unfortunately I'm not interested enough in any of these characters or plot to continue with this series.*ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review, error: –2.5 starsFirst of all I want to say that I think it's unfair that this book is in the GCA Semifinals in Young Adult Fantasy when it hasn't even released yet. GR messing up these awards every year is nothing new, but it still bugs me. A book that has been released for months now, should be able to have that spot. I would have said this regardless if I likedThese Violent Delightsor not, I just think other books that have already been released may deserve the exposure more.Edit: Not surprise that it didn't make it into the final round, cause how? No one has read it. This book should have been included in the awards for next year likeThe Queen of Nothingis this year, but it's GR so it will never make sense 🤷🏽‍♀️***R E V I E WTake this review with a grain of salt, because lately I can't seem to enjoy any book.

            "Translation failed for: Initial reaction:Honestly, I'm feeling rather gutted and not in a constructive way with \"Losing Hope\". Holder's account, noted against Sky's, does retread a lot of ground in the story to the point of where in places it feels repetitive (much like Jamie McGuire's \"Walking Disaster\" did with Travis being in the primary seat versus Abby.).I realize it's a challenge to write a companion story that \"flips the script\" or tells a variant version of a same story, but usually the strength in being able to tell an alternate story is to offer new grounds of intrigue and insight specific to the character you're writing the perspective point in. I'll admit there was some potential with that considering Holder reflects on his sister's death and has to deal with the rumors about his person and his own family issues, but I'll admit in the whole time that I followed Holder in this, it was like reading someone's account at arms length and the major measures that shaped him were only with respect to Les's death and Hope's disappearance. Not to mention that I don't think there was anything that new added to the cast at large in this account - the characters had very little dimensions and connectivity, and the mystery was not so much compelling as the first account because you already know what happens in so many measures. Plus, there were some revelations given here that I had a very hard time believing, much like in the first book.So, I'm torn. I don't know whether to give this 1 star or 1.5 stars. I definitely do not think it was as strong as the first book in what it provided, but I need to think about what the experience gave me as to how I'll rate it in the end. Suffice to say, I'm disappointed.Full review:I'm going to start this review with some words on singular stories told from multiple vantage points. In a given scheme of events, despite similarities, no two people have the same interpretation or stakes in a given environment. It takes a level of complexity to be able to tell a similar story from multiple perspectives, plus give weight to the surrounding players who have stakes in that respective story, without repetition. You may have *some* repeating events, but when you repeat a given scenario, it's to highlight details or call attention to things that may not have been seen before or give weight to the measure at hand (usually both). One of the movies I've seen in the past several years that I thought did it well was, aptly titledVantage Point. And to make a reference of an anime series I also thought did the multi-perspective juggling well, one I've rewatched in recent weeks, wasDurarara!!Now you might tell me \"Rose, those are completely different stories and scenarios versus the story that Colleen Hoover's telling here,\" and you would be correct, but there's a reason why I point it out. Both of the examples I cited above tell a single story from multiple viewpoints in one expansion, or a collection of intersecting stories set in one environment but with shared experiences. This is very hard to pull off.You would think if you gave one perspective character a story of their own and then attempt to tell the same story from a different character's perspective in that same environment that it would be easier, because you have more wiggle room to develop them in a separate account, but it presents a similar problem in that you have to challenge yourself not to repeat information there, and carry the story based on that person's account and their respective stakes and experiences. Not to mention, if you have shared characters between both stories, you have to develop them as well.\"Losing Hope\" is a companion novel to Colleen Hoover's \"Hopeless\". I'm going to tell you straight off the bat that you cannot read this novel without reading the first one. It does not stand alone and quite frankly, it does not stand alone well. I said the same thing with another New Adult author this past year - Jamie McGuire, who wrote a companion novel to her book \"Beautiful Disaster\" called \"Walking Disaster.\" Both McGuire and Hoover suffer from the same problems with trying to retell their stories of romance by trying to \"flip the script\" and tell the same story from the hero's perspective. But the thing needed to carry such stories is that you need a strong characters to carry the weight of the full narrative and you need to have variance in the story enough to where you're not blindly rehashing events without good reason.To give Hoover credit compared to McGuire's narrative, at least there wasan attemptto develop Holder's character in this work, particularly with respect to the loss of his sister, the loss of his childhood best friend (Hope), and trying to fit himself back to sorts after his behavior lends to rumors that run every which way but loose.I didn't think Holder's account was enough to carry this entire novel (maybe if it was a novella, but it would depend on the focal points), and you could tell where Hoover retraced details from the previous novel to the point where it was tediously trying to evoke the same emotions that were so potent from Sky's perspective in the previous novel. Sadly, that wasn't to be.Holder starts the novel in a rough place just after losing his twin sister, and he lashes out in his grief. Some of it rubbed me the wrong way (i.e. sleeping with Les's best friend shortly after she died, and then blaming it on Les). He keeps a journal in the book that belonged to his sister, and some of that was fine for summarizing details that were in the previous story alongside new details that fleshed out his childhood experiences, but at the same time, I didn't understand why that couldn't have been applied more to avoid some of the repetition that was in the narrative.I had problems with how Holder preoccupied himself over both Hope and Les to the point that's all his character really encompassed. When Sky comes into the picture, apart from the bargaining he does over her identity, it doesn't provide much that's new. Some of the conversations are verbatim except for supplementing his thoughts during those scenes, but not given enough weight or dimension to see significance there. It's nothing that those who have already read the first novel don't know apart from a few exceptions. The narrative isn't as intimate character-wise as Sky's account (and oddly, Holder still feels like he's telling his grief in many points here instead of coming to terms with it gradually. He sounds a little more like he's 18 here, but it's still hard to find focus with.) It's the same way with him telling of his love for Sky - I don't feel it, I'm informed of it, many times. Mostly telling, not showing.The larger cast of \"Losing Hope\" is underdeveloped and not given much scene time. I thought Sky's presentation here was threadbare at best. And Breckin makes a brief appearance in the novel to serve as a bridge between Holder and Sky when they're apart, but apart from his puppeteering as a \"Gay Mormon\" - he's not really a functional character here. Worse, there's one scene where it seems like he's okay with a character making a homophobic statement to him - I didn't understand that at all.Towards the end of the novel, a revelation's made where Holder finds out his mother knew who kidnapped Hope and withheld the information from him after she (along with Les) came across Hope and her aunt in a diner. That was a MAJOR hole in the story for events, because how would Hope not remember her aunt begging the other family not to tell anyone? It didn't make sense and was hard to buy when Hope had no recollection of anything from her past and she would've been old enough to remember that encounter, even if she was ushered in the vehicle at the time. I don't know, I had a hard time buying that among other details in the work.The melodrama was as problematic in this novel as the former, but with notably weaker character resonance and little offering in the way of substantated story. In the end, I was disappointed with it.Overall score: 1.5/5Note: I received this as an ARC from NetGalley, from the publisher Atria Books., error: Initial reaction:Honestly, I'm feeling rather gutted and not in a constructive way with \"Losing Hope\".

            "Translation failed for: Final rating: 2/5 stars“...there is no way of truly knowing one’s heart until one is put to the test.”⚠ Rewritten the review.This book didn't work out for me.Seriously, the hell did i just read?It was so wrong, and on so many levels. I have no other idea how to say this. But this book isjust wrong.I wanted to love this book, but we were not meant to be.LIKED:☑ world building and idea in generalDISLIKED:☒ Characters, especially Anna. Although, for everyone else, most of them were just okay, so dislike part goes for my lack of emotional attachment. In short - I didn't care about any of them.☒ Story.This review contains slight spoilers!► STORY:\"Dukes are the only demons allowed to possess human bodies. Each Duke commands a legion of demon whisperers who haunt the earth. The whisperers are called the Legionnaires. We sometimes just refer to them as spirits. Between the Dukes and the Legionnaires, there are six hundred and sixty-six demons on earth.”I did the math. “So, twelve Dukes, six hundred fifty-four whisperers, or Legionnaires... where do the Nephilim figure in?”“We’re just a by-product. We don’t count as human, but also don’t qualify as being part of the demon Legionnaires. We work for our fathers and keep our mouths shut. That’s it.”This is basically the story. And the idea is themost unique concept of angels and demons. This I appreciated, but the execution was bad. Really bad. As for the actual synopsis, just read the GR's one, because my brain cells are fried.► CHARACTERS:Almost all of the characters are evil. Which is the point. Major point. And this is how the story is....really evil.I think the author overused point of good and evil in this book. While in between she made characters who were shades of gray. Ok, that was the point, i get it, but she overused the goodness in Anna, and also made it like Kaidan did not have even slightest choice. Interesting. If you wanted real, i mean real, kickass bad boy, who is very very evil because he must be is Jericho Barrons fromFever. And recently, Holland fromA Darker Shade of Magic. I'm sorry but I was really not fan of Kaidan.♦Anna: Anna is the daughter of Belial - Duke of Substance abuse with occupation of physical addictions; primarily drugs and alcoholthat being a type which makes people drink themselves to the point of idiocy or something worse. Either she is going to cry like a baby, orbe eviltrying to be evil (in this way: \"i don't want to do it because i can - but because i must\". ) She is whiny, i-want-to-kill-the-heroine type of character, which is why she is so.......... annoyiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing. I understand, she is part angel too, but she is overly sensitive and cries for everything! P.s. also, incredibly naive.♦Kaidan: As for Kaidan,son of Pharzuph - Duke of Lust with occupation of craving for carnal pleasures of the body; sexual desire outside of marriage,that being whoring, he was just ok to me - but I really hated the fact that he had to continue doing his \"role\" as a \"whore\" because of his father, and even after he fell in love with Anna.Edit:After reading bothSweet Evil Extra #1&Sweet Evil Extra #2, i actually started to slightly like Kaidan. So it went fromHate=>ok=>like=>love.I say, this book would be so awesome, had it been in alternating POVs.♦Kopano, son of Alocer - Duke of Wrath with occupation of spurning love, opting for destruction; quick to anger; unforgivingthat being a type to start fights, was cool, and maybe it would be more interesting if Anna ended up with him, instead of hooking up with Kaidan. He was cool, he has interesting sin, but still........a monk.......really? Really? Still wonders why he hadn't been killed for it.♦Marna & Ginger: As for Marna & Ginger, daughters of Astaroth - Duke of Adultery with occupation of breaking marriage vows; cheating on one’s spousethat being just what it said, cheating people.- Marna was cool, i liked her, and i felt sorry for her. As for Ginger, Marna's twin......... i don't know, she was so-so.♦Blake:I didn't see any point in Blake, son of Melchom - Duke of Envy with occupation of desire for others’ traits, status, abilities, or situations; jealousy; coveting:this being i have no freaking clue, except for having best things and dating cool girls. Lucky him., except that he has the best sin of them all, which is practically, doing nothing.► OVERALL:I'm sorry, but this book just didn't work out for me. Fantastic idea - really loved it, but I disliked the characters, and felt no attachment to any of them. Most of my friends loved it. But I just can't - there are just so many things wrong. P.S. This book is full of trigger warnings, so be careful.Maybe one day I finish it. But I really doubt it.► REVIEW(S) RELATED TO THIS BOOK:◈Sweet Evil (The Sweet Trilogy, #1)◈Sweet Peril (The Sweet Trilogy, #2), error: Ocena końcowa: 2/5 gwiazdek „...nie ma sposobu, aby naprawdę poznać czyjeś serce, dopóki nie zostanie wystawione na próbę.”⚠ Przerobiona recenzja. Ta książka mi nie wyszła. Serio, do cholery, właśnie przeczytałem? To było tak złe i na tak wielu poziomach. Nie mam innego pomysłu, jak to powiedzieć. Ale ta książka jest po prostu zła. Chciałem pokochać tę książkę, ale nie byliśmy sobie przeznaczeni. PODOBAŁO SIĘ: ☑ budowanie świata i pomysł w ogóle NIE PODOBAŁO SIĘ: ☒ Postacie, szczególnie Anna. Chociaż dla wszystkich innych większość z nich była po prostu w porządku, więc część niechęci dotyczy mojego braku emocjonalnego przywiązania. Krótko mówiąc - nie obchodził mnie żaden z nich.☒ Fabuła.Ta recenzja zawiera drobne spoilery!► HISTORIA:\"Książęta są jedynymi demonami, którym wolno opętać ludzkie ciała. Każdy Książę dowodzi legionem demonicznych szeptów, którzy nawiedzają ziemię. Szepty nazywane są Legionistami. Czasami po prostu nazywamy ich duchami. Pomiędzy Książętami i Legionistami na Ziemi jest sześćset sześćdziesiąt sześć demonów.\"Zrobiłem obliczenia. \"Więc dwunastu Książąt, sześćset pięćdziesiąt cztery szepty lub Legionistów... gdzie są Nefilim?\"\"Jesteśmy tylko produktem ubocznym. Nie zaliczamy się do ludzi, ale też nie kwalifikujemy się do demonicznych Legionistów. Pracujemy dla naszych ojców i trzymamy język za zębami. To wszystko.\"To jest w zasadzie historia. A pomysł jest najbardziej unikalną koncepcją aniołów i demonów. To doceniłem, ale wykonanie było złe. Naprawdę złe. Jeśli chodzi o faktyczne streszczenie, po prostu przeczytaj GR, bo moje komórki mózgowe są smażone.► POSTACIE: Prawie wszystkie postacie są złe. O to właśnie chodzi. O co chodzi. O co chodzi. I tak właśnie wygląda ta historia... naprawdę zła. Myślę, że autorka nadużyła w tej książce punktów dobra i zła. W międzyczasie stworzyła postacie, które były odcieniami szarości. Okej, o to chodziło, rozumiem, ale nadużyła dobroci w Annie, a także sprawiła, że ​​Kaidan nie miał nawet najmniejszego wyboru. Interesujące. Jeśli chciałeś prawdziwego, mam na myśli prawdziwego, kopniaka złego chłopca, który jest bardzo, bardzo zły, bo musi taki być, to Jericho Barrons z Fever. A ostatnio Holland z A Darker Shade of Magic. Przepraszam, ale naprawdę nie byłem fanem Kaidana.♦Anna: Anna jest córką Beliala - Księcia Uzależnień z zajęciem uzależnień fizycznych; głównie narkotyków i alkoholu, co jest typem, który sprawia, że ​​ludzie piją do granic idiotyzmu lub czegoś gorszego. Albo będzie płakać jak dziecko, albo będzie zła, próbując być zła (w ten sposób: \"nie chcę tego robić, bo mogę - ale dlatego, że muszę\".) Jest płaczliwą, chcę-zabić-bohaterkę, dlatego jest taka.......... irytującaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii. Rozumiem, ona też jest częściowo aniołem, ale jest przewrażliwiona i płacze z powodu wszystkiego! P.s. jest też niesamowicie naiwna.♦Kaidan: Jeśli chodzi o Kaidana, syna Pharzupha - Księcia Pożądania, którego zajęciem jest pożądanie cielesnych przyjemności; pożądanie seksualne poza małżeństwem, czyli dziwkarstwo, był dla mnie w porządku - ale naprawdę nienawidziłam faktu, że musiał kontynuować swoją \"rolę\" jako \"dziwka\" z powodu swojego ojca, i nawet po tym, jak zakochał się w Annie.Edycja: Po przeczytaniu zarówno Sweet Evil Extra #1, jak i Sweet Evil Extra #2, zaczęłam trochę lubić Kaidana. Więc poszło z Nienawiść=>ok=>lubię=>kocham.Powiedziałabym, że ta książka byłaby niesamowita, gdyby była w naprzemiennych POV-ach.♦Kopano, syn Alocera - Księcia Gniewu z zajęciem odrzucania miłości, wybierając zniszczenie; szybki w gniewie; nieprzejednany, że bycie typem, który wszczyna kłótnie, było fajne, i może byłoby ciekawiej, gdyby Anna skończyła z nim, zamiast wiązać się z Kaidanem. Był fajny, ma interesujący grzech, ale mimo to... mnich... naprawdę? Naprawdę? Nadal zastanawia się, dlaczego nie został za to zabity.♦Marna i Ginger: Jeśli chodzi o Marnę i Ginger, córki Astarotha - Księcia Cudzołóstwa, których zajęciem jest łamanie ślubów małżeńskich; zdradzanie współmałżonka, co jest dokładnie tym, co mówiono, zdradzanie ludzi.- Marna była fajna, lubiłam ją i było mi jej żal. Jeśli chodzi o Ginger, siostrę bliźniaczkę Marny... nie wiem, była taka sobie.♦Blake: Nie widziałem żadnego sensu w Blake'u, synu Melchoma - Księciu Zazdrości, którego zajęciem jest pożądanie cech, statusu, umiejętności lub sytuacji innych; zazdrość; pożądanie: o tym nie mam zielonego pojęcia, poza posiadaniem najlepszych rzeczy i umawianiem się z fajnymi dziewczynami. Ma szczęście., z wyjątkiem tego, że ma najgorszy grzech ze wszystkich, czyli praktycznie nicnierobienie.► OGÓLNIE: Przykro mi, ale ta książka po prostu mi nie wyszła. Fantastyczny pomysł - naprawdę mi się podobał, ale nie lubiłam postaci i nie czułam przywiązania do żadnej z nich. Większość moich przyjaciół to uwielbiała. Ale ja po prostu nie mogę - jest po prostu tak wiele rzeczy nie tak. P.S. Ta książka jest pełna ostrzeżeń, więc bądź ostrożny. Może kiedyś ją skończę. Ale naprawdę w to wątpię.► RECENZJE ZWIĄZANE Z TĄ KSIĄŻKĄ:◈Sweet Evil (The Sweet Trilogy, #1)◈Sweet Peril (The Sweet Trilogy, #2) --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: You can also see this review on my bloghere. :DWhere to start... Well, I'd like to say first of all, that this was disappointing. I was expecting way more out of this book from the positive reviews I've been seeing all over the net. Some of you may know that I hardlyeverdown a book. But this just didn't cut it for me. It had definite flaws all throughout the book that were cliche and just downright frustrating.As for the history/plot in the book, I think it was the only thing that kept me reading, because it was a pretty cool take on angels and demons. The seven deadly sins are in demon form--also known as Dukes--except sloth and gluttony. Those two have been ranked under one form. And there's six addition sins in demon form as well; lying, murder, hatred, theft, adultery, and substance abuse. Also, humans have guardian angels, Nephilim can seem in them, but Anna just started out seeing a white puff of smoke beside the human since she hasn't trained for her \"work.\" Ididlike that idea, it was something I hadn't read before.The main heroine, Anna Whitt, is the daughter of Belial, Duke of Substance Abuse. And I didn't like her, just to put it bluntly. I don't even get her behavior, since she was raised like a southern Bella Swan that basically pants for drugs and alcohol. And she had no idea what was going on with who she really was. I have my limits with weak characters, and Anna met that limit within the first few chapters. She was way too...good.I know how that sounds, but it was just a headache to get through her nice bullshit. And there was a huge thing about her being a virgin. They treated that like it was a sin all on its own, which to me, isn't right. Then,when she got to work with her dad on her alcohol limitit was just a cluster-fuck. Especially when she went into the bar to...work...or whatever she calls it. To me it's just being a floozy drunk.As for Kaidan Rowe, the main hero, is a total arrogant asshole. But it's expected since his father is the Duke of Lust. So there wasn't no surprise there. He's in a band as the drummer, as that's just the icing on the cake. He's got so many fangirls, he can't even count since he's screwed them all. He's the biggest man-whore I've read about, and he didn't even try to hide it that he was since he calls it \"work.\" I don't even know what else to say about him, other than I didn't like him one bit. He knew he was hot shit and didn't care about his reputation. I'm pretty sure his inner self was like:For the other characters, Jay has to be my favorite out of the whole book. He's nice, cute, and he looks out for people when they apparently don't need looking out for. Meaning Anna.Since she's got the entire Nephilim world protecting her it seems.My second favorite is Kopano, son of the Duke of Wrath. Believe it or not, he was a sweetie pie. I was hoping him and Anna would share a little kiss or two. But nooooo, Anna being all hung up on Kaidan's whore-self made her go into lock down mode on her feelings for anyone. Like Bella Swan, when Kaidan left her, she didn't eat, sleep, or communicate with friends. I didn't like the twins--Marna and Ginger--or Blake, there's not really much to say about them other than Ginger was a conniving bitch and Marna was the exact opposite. Then there's Patti. I don't really feel anything for her. Because she sent her adoptive daughter on a road trip, alone, with--apparently--the hottest guy in the whole freaking universe, who also happens to be a demon. Yeah. That's an awesome way to deal with this situation, ay?I know I've read a lot of YA books that have dealt with the use of alcohol, sex, and some drugs, but this was just full-blown drug use and alcoholism. It was making me sick even thinking about it, to be honest. It was invoking teen drinking, drugs, and sex. Big time. There was a couple of scenes where Kaidan was pushing Anna to loose her virginity. But it was to \"test her limits\" though. Which to me, is making me feel confused for her, seeing as he was on her one minute then pushing her away the next. There were some parts in which they almost did go all the way, but Kaidan was like \"oh I don't want to take your virginity in a ratty motel room.\" like that's stopped you before.... But it's always \"make an exception for the good girl who's got to save man-kind.\" And to tell the truth, I almost expected Kaidan to push her too far.There was one part in the book where Anna and a bunch of Kaidan's friends were at an after party after one of Kaidan's shows, and they were drinking and playing truth or dare. Kaidan dared Anna to kiss Kopano, causing Miss Anna to knock Kaidan over in his chair. She was just about to leave when one of the twins was like, \"Kaidan! Get over here!\" for an apology.I heard him approach through the long blades of grass, Marna and Jay must have walked away, because when I looked up, it was only the two of us. He stared down and nudged an old tree stump with his foot.\"Sorry,\" he said, concentrating on giving the stump another good thump.Wow. An apology. I felt myself soften.\"I'm sorry, too, about the whole chair-flipping thing.\"Am I the only one who thinks Kaidan deserved a good kick in his ass? If I were Anna, I would have kick him where the sun don't shine, and laughed about it. I hate it when this happens, where the hero does something stupid and caused the heroine to feel shitty, then he apologizes like a 6-year-old does when he pisses outside of the training toilet.I don't know if I'll read the next books, it's highly unlikely. The book ended off in a weird cliffhanger though, and it left me like, \"That's fucking it? That's the end of the book?\" So yeah, I don't know., error: You can also see this review on my bloghere. :DWhere to start... Well, I'd like to say first of all, that this was disappointing.

Congratulations,my heart is officially made of Tungsten Carbide and I have the emotional functionality of a lobotomy patient.Kuang’s writing can still verge on childish and immature at times. It’s not nearly as prominent as in the two previous books in the trilogy but it’s still there. Rin will often say or do something ridiculous or over-the-top which only ever feels like a transparent attempt at fan-service. On top of this, many of the characters have the same voice, which I can only assume is Kuang’s own voice coming through too strongly. I criticised Stephen King for the same thing in ‘The Shining’ so at least Rebecca’s in good company there.For example, I would expect the members of the trifecta to be sagacious and wise but more often than not they come across as petty and mocking just like… Pretty much every other character in the series. Kuang’slack of skill and experience in writing diverse charactersresults in these characters never quite reaching their potential.Rin is still unbearable but I’ve come to terms with thatand don’t wish to spend a great deal of time discussing her character. For more detailed thoughts on Rin, see my review for ‘The Dragon Republic’. All I will say here is that, through the entire journey, she has beena purely reactive protagonist. More often than not, being roused to action by the events surrounding her rather than being the instigator of events and then taking credit for whatever outcome falls into her lap. This series could’ve been a lot better with multiple POVs.The pacing is all over the shop!You know that scene where Schwarzenegger drives a car for the first time in‘Twins’and just alternates rapidly between pedal to the metal and pumping the breaks, that’s this book!There are 3 climaxesin this book and they’re all incredibly underwhelming and undermine the compelling build-up that pre-empts them.The first isthe awakening of Rigaand the culmination of everything we’d learned about the Trifecta. The leadup to this was good. We’d received morsels of information regarding the Trifecta throughout the whole trilogy. I was extremely curious to meet the all-powerful Riga that Daji and Jiang spoke so highly of, we were finally going to get the band back together and then in the blink of an eye… It was over! We met Riga who was really just a one-dimensional douchebag, Rin decided, now that it was too late, that maybe awakening Riga wasn’t the best idea (never mind the fact that Kitay had told her that about 1500 times), Jiang had a self-sacrificial moment that was completely devoid of any emotion and fell completely flat, and then the Hesperians and the Trifecta blew each other to smithereens… The end. Goodbye Trifecta. Ciao. Hasta la vista! I just… I don’t get it! What was the point of that whole sub-plot?!The second (anti) climaxis Rin’s “defeat” of The Republic, Nezha and the Dragon of the Grotto. Again, the bloody Hesperians come in with their damn Dirigibles (If I never hear that word again, it’ll be too soon) and their large-scale Shock Therapy and render a Deity into a whimpering Lizard. Kuang tried to produce a bit of emotion through the deaths of the two newbie Shamans but that brings me to another issue.Who introduces new characters in the final 200 pages of a book?(Chakraborty, but I’ll leave her out of this) We’d met them very briefly earlier in the book but really, who are these people?! I don’t care about them! There was a whole new recruit training section 200 pages before the end of a trilogy… You just… You don’t do that!The last of these 3 (the ending) was serviceable but predictable.After the second climax, Kuang spends probably close to 100 pages on exploring the after effects orby-products of Warand how civil-war, in particular, can tear a Country and its inhabitants apart. I actually thought this was very well done. The bleakness of these chapters leaves no doubt that there are no Victors in War. The only drawback of this section was that it felt quite rushed as Kuang was trying to fit commentary on such a massive subject into a tight leadup to the finale. This really exacerbated the pacing issues of the book. There was also a clumsily placed scene in which Rin exacts revenge on Petra from the Gray Company. I’m not sure what Kuang was playing at here but, to me, it just felt like acompletely gratuitous revenge scenewith the catharsis of killing off a character that we never really got the chance to hate, being the only true objective.I’m pretty sure I mentioned this in my review for ‘The Dragon Republic’ but theconstant reference of Sun Tzu and ‘The Art of War’in this book is ridiculous! It’s scattered throughout the whole book but only really irritated me when I noticed at the start of Chapter 5 that his name was mentioned 6 times in 4 pages. Whenever strategy was discussed, somebody would always mention Sun Tzu’s principles. We get it! You’ve read ‘The Art of War’, can you stop dragging me out of the story to explain its key principles! Kuang also names Zhuangzi at one stage. He is a Taoist philosopher, responsible for one of the two foundational texts of Taoism, the other being Lao Tzu’s ‘Tao Te Ching’. It’s not the end of the world but I would’ve thought in Fantasy, you would, perhaps, use these almost mythic figures as inspiration but not directly reference their real-world texts.With so many references to Sunzi’s Military treatise I was surprised to find such a starkstrategic fallacyin the latter parts of the novel. Rin comes to the assumption that Nezha must have spies inside her army and says,”The question was whether she could limit how much they knew”… Of course, you can Rin! One of the absolute staples of that book that everyone seems to keep mentioning is the importance of espionage:Dead spiesAre those for whomWe deliberately createFalse information;They then pass it onTo the enemySee, simples! When Nezha forced a confrontation in Xuzhou, would it not have been the obvious choice to mislead him into believing you were sending the full force of your army to Xuzhou but covertly send a small cohort of soldiers, along with Papaji, to the Grotto to poison the Dragon? It might not have worked but it certainly seems like the obvious strategy! Some short Papaji POV scenes would’ve worked brilliantly if thrown in amongst the chaos of the battle in Xuzhou!Ultimately, Kuang’s debut series is far from perfect but it is a fast and enjoyable read. It’s also a great way for a younger readers to, hopefully, become inspired to further educate themselves on the tragic modern history of China. In my opinion, it’s the perfect transition novel for those looking to branch out from YA to Adult Fantasy.”Ideological purity is a battle cry, it’s not the stable foundation for a unified country.”, error: The Burning God - 2 ⭐The Dragon Republic - 3 ⭐The Poppy War - 4 ⭐* 21/12/21 - Rating updated from 3 to 2.

This series could’ve been a lot better with multiple POVs.The pacing is all over the shop!You know that scene where Schwarzenegger drives a car for the first time in‘Twins’and just alternates rapidly between pedal to the metal and pumping the breaks, that’s this book!There are 3 climaxesin this book and they’re all incredibly underwhelming and undermine the compelling build-up that pre-empts them.The first isthe awakening of Rigaand the culmination of everything we’d learned about the Trifecta. The leadup to this was good. We’d received morsels of information regarding the Trifecta throughout the whole trilogy. I was extremely curious to meet the all-powerful Riga that Daji and Jiang spoke so highly of, we were finally going to get the band back together and then in the blink of an eye… It was over! We met Riga who was really just a one-dimensional douchebag, Rin decided, now that it was too late, that maybe awakening Riga wasn’t the best idea (never mind the fact that Kitay had told her that about 1500 times), Jiang had a self-sacrificial moment that was completely devoid of any emotion and fell completely flat, and then the Hesperians and the Trifecta blew each other to smithereens… The end. Goodbye Trifecta. Ciao. Hasta la vista! I just… I don’t get it! What was the point of that whole sub-plot?!The second (anti) climaxis Rin’s “defeat” of The Republic, Nezha and the Dragon of the Grotto. Again, the bloody Hesperians come in with their damn Dirigibles (If I never hear that word again, it’ll be too soon) and their large-scale Shock Therapy and render a Deity into a whimpering Lizard. Kuang tried to produce a bit of emotion through the deaths of the two newbie Shamans but that brings me to another issue.Who introduces new characters in the final 200 pages of a book?(Chakraborty, but I’ll leave her out of this) We’d met them very briefly earlier in the book but really, who are these people?! I don’t care about them! There was a whole new recruit training section 200 pages before the end of a trilogy… You just… You don’t do that!The last of these 3 (the ending) was serviceable but predictable.After the second climax, Kuang spends probably close to 100 pages on exploring the after effects orby-products of Warand how civil-war, in particular, can tear a Country and its inhabitants apart. I actually thought this was very well done. The bleakness of these chapters leaves no doubt that there are no Victors in War. The only drawback of this section was that it felt quite rushed as Kuang was trying to fit commentary on such a massive subject into a tight leadup to the finale. This really exacerbated the pacing issues of the book. There was also a clumsily placed scene in which Rin exacts revenge on Petra from the Gray Company. I’m not sure what Kuang was playing at here but, to me, it just felt like acompletely gratuitous revenge scenewith the catharsis of killing off a character that we never really got the chance to hate, being the only true objective.I’m pretty sure I mentioned this in my review for ‘The Dragon Republic’ but theconstant reference of Sun Tzu and ‘The Art of War’in this book is ridiculous! It’s scattered throughout the whole book but only really irritated me when I noticed at the start of Chapter 5 that his name was mentioned 6 times in 4 pages. Whenever strategy was discussed, somebody would always mention Sun Tzu’s principles. We get it! You’ve read ‘The Art of War’, can you stop dragging me out of the story to explain its key principles! Kuang also names Zhuangzi at one stage. He is a Taoist philosopher, responsible for one of the two foundational texts of Taoism, the other being Lao Tzu’s ‘Tao Te Ching’. It’s not the end of the world but I would’ve thought in Fantasy, you would, perhaps, use these almost mythic figures as inspiration but not directly reference their real-world texts.With so many references to Sunzi’s Military treatise I was surprised to find such a starkstrategic fallacyin the latter parts of the novel. Rin comes to the assumption that Nezha must have spies inside her army and says,”The question was whether she could limit how much they knew”… Of course, you can Rin! One of the absolute staples of that book that everyone seems to keep mentioning is the importance of espionage:Dead spiesAre those for whomWe deliberately createFalse information;They then pass it onTo the enemySee, simples! When Nezha forced a confrontation in Xuzhou, would it not have been the obvious choice to mislead him into believing you were sending the full force of your army to Xuzhou but covertly send a small cohort of soldiers, along with Papaji, to the Grotto to poison the Dragon? It might not have worked but it certainly seems like the obvious strategy! Some short Papaji POV scenes would’ve worked brilliantly if thrown in amongst the chaos of the battle in Xuzhou!Ultimately, Kuang’s debut series is far from perfect but it is a fast and enjoyable read. It’s also a great way for a younger readers to, hopefully, become inspired to further educate themselves on the tragic modern history of China. In my opinion, it’s the perfect transition novel for those looking to branch out from YA to Adult Fantasy.”Ideological purity is a battle cry, it’s not the stable foundation for a unified country.” --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

The first part (\"Human\") kept me fairly intrigued, but I felt my interest wane with each successive chapter.

In a world of mainstream fiction and media dominated by male main characters, why would such a thing (a strong female main character) bug me? Well, I believe that a story shouldn't get propsjustfor having a strong female character as a lead.

            "Translation failed for: **SPOILERS BELOW**This review may seem a bit negative, but I really didn't think that this book was bad... I just thought it was a little too \"stretched\" for my liking. I 100% believe that it is possible for this little boy to have gone to heaven & seen Jesus Christ & seen relatives from the other side of the veil. I also believe that it was possible for him to see things that were occurring to his parents while he was in surgery. However, I find a few things that the author talked about a little hard to swallow. For these reasons, I feel like the author maybe \"exaggerated\" a little bit - I mean (lets be honest) when we are telling a really compelling story to our friends/family, we all tend to over-embellish details so that our story seems more cutting-edge and gripping for the listener. While I think that this little boy had an INCREDIBLE experience, I feel like there were a lot of details that were a little \"too drawn out\" which may have helped the author really promote this book. Let me elaborate:1. \"Jesus loves the Children\" - Any 4 year old boy (or younger) is going to have this engrained in his head growing up. It is going to be something that parents, teachers, family, friends, babysitters, etc. share with children. They share this because they want to teach children about their own faith, they want their children to have a strong conviction of the Savior and live such Christlike principles, and they also share this because of how much it is re-iterated in the Bible. I know and I believe that Jesus loves the children... but just because Colton goes around saying this \"non-stop\" doesn't necessarily mean that was what the Savior told Colton up there. I believe that the Savior shows others he loves little children through his actions, and while he may have said to Colton that he loved the little children and therefore he loves him... I don't think that the Savior told him that he needed to make sure everyone on earth understood that principle through this little boy.2. \"Oh yeah...\" I feel like over and over in this book every time the author wanted to teach a religious principle, it was echoed by his son saying, \"Oh yeah... I learned that in Heaven.\" Examples include, \"Oh yeah, they do too have swords in heaven.\", \"Oh yeah, Jesus told me that he told you to personally become a pastor.\", \"Oh yeah, Jesus told me that if you don't accept him in your heart that you aren't going to heaven.\", \"Oh yeah, even though you've never told me a story about what Heaven looks like, this is what it looks like.\", \"Oh yeah, there is going to be a war in heaven.\" , \"Oh yeah, Jesus showed me that you were fighting in it Daddy.\" \"Oh yeah, even though I never met my future brother, I met my so-called, supposed to be sister who appeared the same age as me.\", \"Oh yeah, Dad didn't you know that God the Father & the Son & the Holy Ghost are three separate beings?\" (The list could continue). But the only point that I am trying to make is that all of these topics that Colton supposedly \"brought-up on his own\" just seems a little to coincidental that they were religious principles that the author was trying to teach the reader. Don't get me wrong, and think that I'm a pessimistic atheist, I actually am a devout Christian - and I believe a lot of the things that were written in this #2 section - but it just seemed a little off to me that the little boy just so happened to have all of these very long conversations with God & Jesus while he was gone & that all the things he talked about fit into this authors \"sermon.\"3. My little boy didn't know the word for... Just because Colton didn't know the word for \"sash\" & \"throne\" doesn't mean that he wasn't taught this before hand. He probably was - children learn a lot more through picture books than we give them credit for - so don't act like it was a big revelation that he was teaching you what he saw when in reality, he probably saw it several times before his experience in Heaven.4. Pops & Sister. I believe 100% that you can have experiences with deceased relatives on the other side of the veil - and I believe that Colton was telling the truth when it was explained that he saw his \"pops\" in his prime age (about 30's). But I have a really hard time believing that he saw his older sister as a sibling typed age - when she was miscarried - it just seems a little back-words and inconsistent with the author's theories... but then again I think that there is a lot we don't know about Heaven & Hell.5. I don't believe for a single second that Colton saw Satan. Really???!!!??? Satan in Heaven... um... that seems like a huge HUGE contradiction to everything that is taught in the Bible. If the author claims that we have to \"accept Jesus into our hearts to enter into heaven\" then what the crap is Satan doing up in Heaven? And angels with swords guarding heaven so that he can't enter? It seemed a little far-fetched for me. Almost like it was a retaliation by Colton to get back at his sister for saying that there weren't swords in heaven. A little light-bulb went off in his head saying, \"Yes too there are swords in heaven, and everyone makes such a big deal about what I tell them about Heaven, that I'll just tell them there are swords up there and they will believe me.\"6. And I don't believe for a single second that Colton saw Armageddon. Isn't that supposed to be a mystery when this war is supposed to take place. What would be the use of Prophets if we had little 4 year old boys telling us when it was going to occur. Once again - a little exaggerated.7. At two different points in the book Colton describes heaven as white & gold & beautiful... but then again with colors that we have never seen in this world. I just had a hard time deciding which one was true.Anyways - I really did think that this book was alright - there were just too many \"really???\"s to swallow. Like I said earlier, I believe a lot of concepts that were shared in this book - just not to the same extent that the author exploited them. Maybe my attitude would be different if I had a child which experienced Heaven at the age of 4.On a positive note, I did like the story about Miracles, how prayers are answered, Jesus' appearance, and miracles of tithes & offerings which were shared in this book., error: **SPOILERS BELOW**This review may seem a bit negative, but I really didn't think that this book was bad... I just thought it was a little too \"stretched\" for my liking. I 100% believe that it is possible for this little boy to have gone to heaven & seen Jesus Christ & seen relatives from the other side of the veil. I also believe that it was possible for him to see things that were occurring to his parents while he was in surgery. However, I find a few things that the author talked about a little hard to swallow. For these reasons, I feel like the author maybe \"exaggerated\" a little bit - I mean (lets be honest) when we are telling a really compelling story to our friends/family, we all tend to over-embellish details so that our story seems more cutting-edge and gripping for the listener. While I think that this little boy had an INCREDIBLE experience, I feel like there were a lot of details that were a little \"too drawn out\" which may have helped the author really promote this book. Let me elaborate:1. \"Jesus loves the Children\" - Any 4 year old boy (or younger) is going to have this engrained in his head growing up. It is going to be something that parents, teachers, family, friends, babysitters, etc. share with children. They share this because they want to teach children about their own faith, they want their children to have a strong conviction of the Savior and live such Christlike principles, and they also share this because of how much it is re-iterated in the Bible. I know and I believe that Jesus loves the children... but just because Colton goes around saying this \"non-stop\" doesn't necessarily mean that was what the Savior told Colton up there. I believe that the Savior shows others he loves little children through his actions, and while he may have said to Colton that he loved the little children and therefore he loves him... I don't think that the Savior told him that he needed to make sure everyone on earth understood that principle through this little boy.2. \"Oh yeah...\" I feel like over and over in this book every time the author wanted to teach a religious principle, it was echoed by his son saying, \"Oh yeah... I learned that in Heaven.\" Examples include, \"Oh yeah, they do too have swords in heaven.\", \"Oh yeah, Jesus told me that he told you to personally become a pastor.\", \"Oh yeah, Jesus told me that if you don't accept him in your heart that you aren't going to heaven.\", \"Oh yeah, even though you've never told me a story about what Heaven looks like, this is what it looks like.\", \"Oh yeah, there is going to be a war in heaven.\" , \"Oh yeah, Jesus showed me that you were fighting in it Daddy.\" \"Oh yeah, even though I never met my future brother, I met my so-called, supposed to be sister who appeared the same age as me.\", \"Oh yeah, Dad didn't you know that God the Father & the Son & the Holy Ghost are three separate beings?\" (The list could continue). But the only point that I am trying to make is that all of these topics that Colton supposedly \"brought-up on his own\" just seems a little to coincidental that they were religious principles that the author was trying to teach the reader. Don't get me wrong, and think that I'm a pessimistic atheist, I actually am a devout Christian - and I believe a lot of the things that were written in this #2 section - but it just seemed a little off to me that the little boy just so happened to have all of these very long conversations with God & Jesus while he was gone & that all the things he talked about fit into this authors \"sermon.\"3. My little boy didn't know the word for... Just because Colton didn't know the word for \"sash\" & \"throne\" doesn't mean that he wasn't taught this before hand. He probably was - children learn a lot more through picture books than we give them credit for - so don't act like it was a big revelation that he was teaching you what he saw when in reality, he probably saw it several times before his experience in Heaven.4. Pops & Sister. I believe 100% that you can have experiences with deceased relatives on the other side of the veil - and I believe that Colton was telling the truth when it was explained that he saw his \"pops\" in his prime age (about 30's). But I have a really hard time believing that he saw his older sister as a sibling typed age - when she was miscarried - it just seems a little back-words and inconsistent with the author's theories... but then again I think that there is a lot we don't know about Heaven & Hell.5. I don't believe for a single second that Colton saw Satan. Really???!!!??? Satan in Heaven... um... that seems like a huge HUGE contradiction to everything that is taught in the Bible. If the author claims that we have to \"accept Jesus into our hearts to enter into heaven\" then what the crap is Satan doing up in Heaven? And angels with swords guarding heaven so that he can't enter? It seemed a little far-fetched for me. Almost like it was a retaliation by Colton to get back at his sister for saying that there weren't swords in heaven. A little light-bulb went off in his head saying, \"Yes too there are swords in heaven, and everyone makes such a big deal about what I tell them about Heaven, that I'll just tell them there are swords up there and they will believe me.\"6. And I don't believe for a single second that Colton saw Armageddon. Isn't that supposed to be a mystery when this war is supposed to take place. What would be the use of Prophets if we had little 4 year old boys telling us when it was going to occur. Once again - a little exaggerated.7. At two different points in the book Colton describes heaven as white & gold & beautiful... but then again with colors that we have never seen in this world. I just had a hard time deciding which one was true.Anyways - I really did think that this book was alright - there were just too many \"really???\"s to swallow. Like I said earlier, I believe a lot of concepts that were shared in this book - just not to the same extent that the author exploited them. Maybe my attitude would be different if I had a child which experienced Heaven at the age of 4.On a positive note, I did like the story about Miracles, how prayers are answered, Jesus' appearance, and miracles of tithes & offerings which were shared in this book. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: EDIT:01/13/13 Just saw how wrong some of my grammar were in this review and how I did not properly explained why I only gave this book 2 stars. So, I guess I shall rewrite it. Anyway, as of now, I shall warn you about this review I wrote. 1st: It is angsty. 2nd: there are a lot of wrong grammars. 3rd: I failed to explain my side logically. 4th: I think I misunderstood the ending (but that still didn't change my perspective to this whole trilogy). 5th: If you LOVE the ending of this book, I recommendNOTto continue reading any further. This review is full of rants towards that matter. So, until I rewrite this, you can't read this.BUTif you also dislike the ending, and reading quite a lot of wrong grammars is okay with you, then you may proceed. We might have the same perspective in this book.My Review:Ok, I must admit, I only like this book. Not love or anything beyond like (which is unusual for the last two books of the Kane Chronicles trilogy totally made me a fan girl). This series made me interested in mythologies and discover Rick Riordan (who is my number one favorite author) and check out his other books and read one of the best book series in the world, thePercy Jackson and the Olympiansseries that totally live up in my expectations and gave every avid fan of Percabeth their satisfaction. But this… Oh Hades! Don’t even get me started on the Walt/Sadie/Anubis love triangle! Anyway, I’d like to reserve the criticisms for later. Let’s focus first on the positive side, shall we?I enjoyed this book. I would have given it five stars if I didn’t read what happened to Walt and Anubis. If you’re in love with Zarter (Zia/Carter) you’ll appreciate this book as much as I do (but sadly, I’m more in love with Sanubis and again, I’ll tell you later why I only gave this book three stars). There are some scenes that made me crack up like this:“That’s my boy!” Set shouted. “Shut up, Father,” Anubis said.Isn’t Anubis adorable? If you didn’t crack up on that one, well, you haven’t read the whole situation why they said that. So, I don’t blame you. Getting out of topic again eh? Back to the topic, there are so many unexpected things happening. It’s not that bad for a last book (though the ending hinted something for some future books) it totally live up to my expectations (if you don’t count the love triangle of Sadie). We met more and more Egyptian gods like Shu (ah, my favorite Egyptian god after Anubis) and Hapi. Where’s Tefnut? She’s my favorite Egyptian goddess and didn’t even appear in any book in this trilogy! It also helps us to know more about the world of Egyptian mythology with the Land of Demons, sheut (aka shadows being part of our soul) and many more. In romance, Rick Riordan did a great job on Zarter. I couldn’t help but to squeal whenever they have moments!Criticism part. My criticism is not about how the book is written, plot and/or other things but on the love triangle between Walt/Sadie/Anubis. I DISLIKE IT!!! Ever since I started reading The Red Pyramid, whenever Sadie and Anubis have moments, I always squeal, highlight them on the book and rereading it all over again and even adding some comments! I had (take note of the past tense) love Sanubis with all my life! Forbidden love always interest me and I had only read few forbidden loves that actually live up to my expectations like the true love between Ash and Meghan from theIron Feyseries. Now, that’s what I call a very interesting forbidden love! They did everything so that they can be together and Ash even went to the End of the World to have a soul so that he’ll be with Meghan forever! But this… Urgh! The Sanubis in this book is aTOTAL disappointment!Oh come on! Give me a break! I know thatAnubis made Walt as his host that made the dying boy’s life expand and both end up with Sadie and that they’re two inhabiting one body that are just in harmony thanks to their similarities and their feelings for Sadie and everything.Puh-lease! THIS IS NOT WHAT AN ADDICTED SANUBIS FAN LIKE ME EXPECT! Why can’t the Egyptian gods just offer Sadie immortality and be a goddess to be with Anubis? After all Sadie deserved it! Why can Greek gods offer Percy immortality thanks to the heroic deeds (just like Sadie and Carter did) he did and Egyptians can’t? Because they can’t and Greeks can? Give me a break! I had supported Kane Chronicles since the first book was published. I waited for a year for the Throne of Fire and waited another one for the last book, hoping to find more Sanubis that’ll satisfy my needs. But no! It issoobvious that Sadie and Walt ended up together! And it is totally heartbreaking for a Sanubis fan like me. Walt had his own advantages! It’s his body, so when he kiss Sadie, it’s his own pleasure not Anubis’s! And Anubis? He’s just there watching them even if he’s in the same body. Poor boy! He doesn’t deserve that! I am so glad the book didn’t reach Philippines! I’m so glad I just found this in the internet! I’m so glad I spent my money I intend to buy for this book to my mom on Mother’s Day. As aonceSanubis fan, I won’t buy this book. And I thought Kane Chronicles is a great series! I don’t like RR’s new writing style in Romance, the protagonist ending up with his second love not the first.Anyway, that’s where my rant about romance ends. If there’s a new book in this series (which I slightly doubt but the ending totally says that there’s a next one) I’m not going to buy it unless I’ll find it interesting (which I highly doubt). That’s all.Though if RR will write a next book about a crossover between Kane Chronicles and Percy Jackson and the Olympians, I might buy it. Again, it hinted on the ending about Long Island and everything.Before I go, here’s the last chapter of the book. Thought you might wanna know what I meant with the Sanubis/Salt and hinted stuff.HE’D CHANGED HIS LOOK AGAIN.His amulets were gone except for one- theshenthat matched mine. He wore a black muscle shirt, black jeans, a black leather duster, and black combat boots-a sort of mix of Anubis’s and Walt’s styles, but it made him look like someone entirely different and new. Yet his eyes were quite familiar-warm, dark brown, and lovely. When he smiled, my heart fluttered as it always had.“So,” I said, “is this another goodbye? I’ve had quite enough goodbyes today.”“Actually,” Walt said,” It’s more of a hello. My name’s Walt Stone, from Seattle. I’d like to join the party.”He held out his hand, still smiling slyly. He was repeating exactly what he’d said the first time we met, when he arrived at Brooklyn House last spring. Instead of taking hand, I punched him in the chest. “Ow,” he complained. But I doubt that I’d hurt him. He had quite a solid chest. “You think you can just merge with a god andsurpriseme like that?” I demanded. “Oh by the way, I’m actually two minds in one body. I don’t appreciate being taken off guard.”“I did try to tell you,” he said. “Several times. Anubis did too. We kept getting interrupted. Mostly by you talking a lot.” ““No excuse.” I folded my arms and scowled as best as I could. “My mum seems to think I should go easy on you because this is all very new to you. But I’m still cross. It’s confusing enough, you know, liking someone, without their morphing into agodwhom I also like.”“So you do like me.”“Stop trying to distract me! Are you truly asking to stay here?” Walt nodded. He was very close now. He smelled good, like vanilla candles. I tried to remember if that Walt’s scent or Anubis’s. Honestly, I couldn’t recall.“I’ve still got a lot to learn,” he said. “I don’t need to stick with charm-making anymore. I can do more intensive magic-the path of Anubis. No one’s ever done that before.”“Discovering new magical ways to annoy me?”He tilted his head. “I could do amazing tricks with mummy linen. For instance, if someone talks too much, I could summon a gag-““Don’t you dare!”He took my hand. I gave him a defiant scowl, but I didn’t take back my hand. “I’m still Walt,” he said. “I’m still mortal. Anubis can stay in this world as long as I’m his host. I’m hoping to live a good long life. Neither of us ever thought that was possible. SO I’m not going anywhere, unless you want me to leave.”My eyes probably answered for me:No, please. Not ever.But I couldn’t very well give him the satisfaction of me saying that out loud, could I? Boys can get so full of themselves.“Well,” I grumbled,” I suppose I could tolerate it.”“I owe you a dance.” Walt put his other hand on my waist-a traditional pose, very old-fashions, as Anubis had done when we waltzed at the Brooklyn Academy. My Gran would’ve approved.“May I?” he asked.“Here?” I said. “Won’t your chaperone Shu interrupt?”“Like I said, I’m mortal now. He’ll let us dance, though I’m sure he’s keeping an eye on us to make sure we behave.”“To make sureyoubehave,” I snipped. “I’m a proper young lady.”Walt laughed. I supposed it was funny.Properwasn’t the first word normally used to describe me.I pounded his chest again, though I’ll admit not very hard. I put my hand on his shoulder. “I’ll have you remember,” I warned,” that my father if your employer in the Underworld. You’d best mind your manners.”“Yes, ma’am,” Walt said. He leaned down and kissed me. All my anger melted into my shoes.We started to dance. There was no music, no ghostly dancers, no floating on air-nothing magic about it. Freak watched us curiously, no doubt wondering how this activity was going to produce turkeys to feed the griffin. The old tar roof creaked under our feet. I was still quite tired from our long battle, and I hadn’t cleaned up properly. No doubt I looked horrid. I wanted to melt into Walt’s arms, which is basically what I did.“So you’ll let me stick around?” he asked, his breath warm on my scalp. “Let me experience a typical teenage life?”“I suppose.” I looked up at him. It took no effort at all to slip my vision fort at all to slip my vision into the Duat and see Anubis there, just under the surface. But it really wasn’t necessary. This was a new boy in front of me, and he was everything I liked. “Not that I’m an expert myself, but there is one rule I insist on.”“Yes?”“If anyone asks you if you’re taken,” I said,” the answer ifyes.”“I think I can live with that,” he promised.“Good,” I said. “Because you don’t want to see me be cross.”“too late.”“Shut up and dance, Walt.”We did-with the music of a psychotic griffin screaming behind us, and the sirens and horns of Brooklyn wailing below. It was quite romantic.So there you have it.We’ve returned to Brooklyn House. The various catastrophes plaguing the world have lessened-at least somewhat-and we are dealing with an influx of new initiates as the school year gets properly under way.It should be obvious now why this may be our last recording. We’re going to be so busy training and attending school and living our lives, I doubt we’ll have time or reason to send out anymore audio pleas for help.We’ll put this tape in a secure box and send it along to the chap who’s been transcribing our adventures. Carter seems to think the postal service will do, but I think I’ll give it to Khufu to carry through the Duat. What could possibly go wrong?As for us, don’t think our lives will be all fun and games. Amos couldn’t leave a mob of teens unsupervised, and as we don’t have Bast anymore, Amos has sent a few adult magicians to Brooklyn House as teachers (read: chaperones). But we all know who’s really in charge-me. Oh, yes, and perhaps Carter a little bit.We’re not done with trouble, either. I’m still worried about that murderous ghost Setne, who’s on the loose in this world with his devious mind, horrible fashion sense, and the Book of Thoth. I’m also puzzling over my mother’s comments about rival magic and other gods. No idea what that means, but it doesn’t sound good.(Skip the last part), error: EDIT:01/13/13 Just saw how wrong some of my grammar were in this review and how I did not properly explained why I only gave this book 2 stars.

            "Translation failed for: Dear Son:The Too-Little-Too-Late Dilemma of Marilynne Robinson’s GileadIt’s deceptively tempting to approach a book like Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead, and see only the main character’s theological musings. After all, in a novel about an old man reminiscing about faith and family, there’s a plethora of weighty spiritual content; everything from careful exegesis of Genesis 22 to references to Karl Barth’s Epistle to the Romans. Needless to say, this is no simple “I remember when…” fable of love and loss. Issues are being grappled with, weighed and eschewed. However, to review the novel from a theological stance cannot merely mean discussing old John Ames’ opinions on war, forgiveness or predestination. That job belongs primarily to his congregants and family within the narrative. The question I, the reader, encountered was of the theology of a book wherein the entire premise is of a man wishing to leave a testament of his “better self” (p. 202) for his seven year old, but spends his final days journaling, instead of spending time with his son. This is the battle I fought with John Ames and Marilynne Robinson throughout my reading.It began when I realized that about every four pages I found myelf drowsing off to sleep, or thinking of topics far beyond the narrator’s journal entries. As I had approached the novel with great enthusiasm (fiction at last!) I wondered what could be sending my mind off into orbit. Why the dissociation? From the frustration with not being able to stay focused from page to page, paragraph to paragraph, soon emerged actual anger. I found myself choosing to put the book down and find other activities, almost as if to spite the narrator. Something was wrong. I was refusing to sit passively and listen.With a little reflection, this is what I discovered. I was incredibly angry that John Ames was writing on and on about how much he loved his son and his wife and how he wished he wasn't about to die, and there he was, “reflecting” instead of living! Enter the transference. I realized how little tolerance I had for the “nobility” of a strong, silent-type preacher man finally unloading the deepest parts of his heart and soul onto paper, instead of through interaction. The drowsiness coming over me was of not wanting to listen to this man write. I wanted to see him take action. I didn’t want to honor him by reading his last testament, because I do not respect the idea that somehow, as long as you say what you feel before you die, it doesn’t matter how little you expressed to those around you until that point. The book brought up anger with my father, his father, and the generations of quiet, long-suffering, missionary-type men I am descended from. Though I am not a man, nor very quiet, I know about long-suffering, and I could not suffer the boredom or veiled anger that lay between the lines of John Ames’ memoirs. I wanted to rip the journal from his hands, and essentially, tell Marilynne Robinson that I refuse to applaud her character’s poetry, theology or self-reflection, when he is in essence, taking the easy way out of sharing himself.I’ll admit, there are plenty of passages in the novel that show Ames’ growth and interaction with others. Even the fact that he married late in life reveals that he was unsatisfied persisting in the loneliness of listening to baseball games on the radio, writing sermons and hiding from neighbors when they knocked on his door. However, all his loving descriptions of sunsets, children’s laughter and the smell of raindrops, appear hollow the moment he starts describing his son playing outside as he writes. In that the entire purpose of the novel is for this aging father to express his heart to his son, for all the descriptions of moments of communion, (p. 103), I gained no sense whatsoever of how this father related to his son. Every human interaction Ames (Robinson) writes is marked by constraint, weariness and shy civility. The aching lack of intimacy in this novel made every page a grueling ordeal to wade through. “Take action!” I shouted. “Stop writing!”I’m left to wonder what Robinson feels about her main character. I sense that she adores his humble (though never naïve) faith, and the grace he tries to offer others. But the portrait she paints, or at least the format she has chosen to use, counteracts any message I might derive from the old preacher’s wisdom and experience. By writing the story as a last testament in-progress, Robinson has created an utterly passive character, a true bystander of the life he is narrating. I don’t believe this was her goal. We are clearly supposed to revel in the homely and kindly spiritual reflections of a faithful old coot that is continually surprised by beauty. But for this passive bystander, I felt mostly pity, and quite a bit of anger.Another perspective, however, is that Robinson has rightly captured the unfortunate experience of so many pastors, especially of Ames’ (and my grandfather’s) generation: that of distance and objectivity. My grandfather once spoke of a minister he served under who believed it was un-Christian for a minister to befriend his congregants because it would cloud his ability to pastor. Can we even imagine a pastor who would not eat supper at a parishioner’s home? Does Ames’ loner quality, his reticence to become entangled, simply reflect the expectations put on a country preacher? This was the time (and the concept persists in some realms) where the pastor was expected to run every aspect of the church. Ames’ statement that everyday felt essentially like Sunday because once one sermon was over, it was already time to work on the next (p. 232-233), reflects the overburdened lifestyle of one who is expected to shepherd whole congregations by sheer determination and will power- with no rest or support system other than other local pastors (Boughton). This symptomatic lone wolf quality made it difficult for me to believe Ames’ speculations on relationships, because I could hear his strained resentment trying to come out. (It finally emerges somewhat in regards to being given a godson without his consent, and over Jack Boughton’s flagrant disrespect for others).I have not written much of Ames and Jack Boughton, mostly because the character was introduced far too late in the novel to bear the climactic significance it was clearly supposed to have. The real story should have been how Ames chooses to reveal himself and be present with his young son, not his struggle to give grace to his black sheep of a godson. That is indeed significant, but is again, un-served by the journal format of the book. The developing story of Jack Boughton’s struggles have no place in Ames’ letters to his son. Confined by Robinson’s poorly chosen device, the last fourth of the book (despite being the most readable) breaks the rules set in the beginning of Ames writing to his son. Instead, the reader encounters Robinson’s clunky exposition about the life of a character we have not been effectively convinced to care about. Overall, this is my greatest criticism for the novel, both artistically and theologically: it’s nearly impossible to care for these characters when they are introduced as part of an avoidant old man’s journal entry. The richer story to be told here is that of an old man opening his heart through action and engagement with his community, after a long life of loneliness. In order to experience this part of the story, Robinson needed to give us voices other than Ames to listen to. Ames’ emotional distance in interpersonal relationships makes his spiritual and poetic ruminations fall short of the impact Robinson so clearly intended. This novel made my heart ache; wanting the silent men in my life to get up from their journals, and actually say what they’re thinking. And this, perhaps, is too much to require of a novel. Is it too much to require of these old men as well? Isn’t the real point of a last testament the admittance that too much has gone unsaid? Should we celebrate a theology that waits too long to speak?, error: Dear Son:The Too-Little-Too-Late Dilemma of Marilynne Robinson’s GileadIt’s deceptively tempting to approach a book like Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead, and see only the main character’s theological musings. After all, in a novel about an old man reminiscing about faith and family, there’s a plethora of weighty spiritual content; everything from careful exegesis of Genesis 22 to references to Karl Barth’s Epistle to the Romans. Needless to say, this is no simple “I remember when…” fable of love and loss. Issues are being grappled with, weighed and eschewed. However, to review the novel from a theological stance cannot merely mean discussing old John Ames’ opinions on war, forgiveness or predestination. That job belongs primarily to his congregants and family within the narrative. The question I, the reader, encountered was of the theology of a book wherein the entire premise is of a man wishing to leave a testament of his “better self” (p. 202) for his seven year old, but spends his final days journaling, instead of spending time with his son.

            "Translation failed for: || 2.0 stars ||Well, damn. This was incredibly disappointing...I don’t even really know where to start with this review, because I feel like I have so many complaints.First and foremost, let’s start with one of the book’s most glaring issues: the writing was genuinelybad. It’s as plain and simple as that. This whole thing dragged like crazy and I was just so bored most of the time. Not only that, the writing was also painfully shallow. Nothing and no one had depth: all of the characters were completely one-dimensional and the plot failed to be interesting or engaging in any way.Speaking of the characters, let’s go on with my complaints by talking about our failure of a main character. I don’t know what happened to Violet between this one and the previous book, but I don’t recognize her whatsoever. She used to be the perfect balance of kind and bad-ass with a clever and sharp mind to boot! But now this girl we all knew and loved disappeared completely and instead we got this whiny, insecure idiot without a single rational thought going on inside that annoying brain of hers. I suddenly couldn’t stand her anymore!Same goes for Xaden: he suffered from major character assassination as well. He used to be strong, smart, mysterious, intriguing, and swoony as hell, but that was all gone now. Xaden turned into the most flat character ever, and he had no depth whatsoever. He truly felt like a robot to me, and I lost all interest in him. He is gone for most of the book, and at first I really missed his presence, but after a while, I was just bored every time he came on page, because I knew he would be the same repetitive and annoying character he was during all his other scenes, so I kind of didn’t care anymore if he was gone or not.The fact that both Violet and Xaden turned into insufferable characters is probably a big reason as to why their romance was terrible in this book too. First of all, after the end of the first book Ineededto get some groveling from Xaden, but did we get that here? No. Not even for a second. Xaden wasn’t sorry, he wasn’t regretful, he wasn’t trying to earn back Violet’s trust. No. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t even fight for Violet to forgive him. He was just... waiting. Not lifting a single finger to get back the woman he supposedly loves. He was so cocky in knowing that Violet would crawl back to him anyway that he refused to do anything to speed up the process. He just waited. And I guess he was right, because our spine-less heroine did indeed take him back without getting anything in return: no promises, no trust. Just nothing.Which obviously leads to a very unhealthy relationship between them where they don’t trust each other and in which they refuse to communicate. EVER. All they do is be horny and have sex, but they never actually talk anymore. They don’t confide in each other and neither do they let themselves fully open up to the other. Their entire relationship was just shallow, boring and irritating. I no longer liked anything about it. And then we even got some goddamn other woman drama, and my patience just vanished! I hated it.Now, when it comes to the side characters I don’t even know where to begin, because I feel like none of them were written well or with any depth to them. It’s like the author could never seem to focus on more than a few characters at the same time, so whenever she wanted to pay attention to one side character, all the other side characters just fell away. For example: at the beginning of this book we have quite a lot of focus on Imogen, and I was really seeing some amazing progress between her and Violet. I thought I saw the start of a beautiful friendship forming between them. But then, the moment Rhiannon started coming back into the fold (after being ignored in the first part), Imogen completely fell away again and her relationship with Violet never picked up. It’s like the author couldn’t handle Violet having more than one close female friend; she couldn’t focus on both at the same time. And therefore, neither Imogen or Rhiannon ever truly felt like friends to Violet because they were often suddenly ignored in her inner monologue or in the story. They were more like decoration, like tools to further the story along. Thus, none of Violet’s friends ever feel like real characters on their own..I loved the dragons in the first book; they were my favourite part of the entire book. But now, I couldn’t care less. Tairn used to be this sassy, grumpy dad-type, but now he was just a flat, monotone character with no real personality. Everything he said was repetitive, and his entire character just seemed way too simple and lacking any sort of depth. When it came to Andarna, I genuinely think her entire character was butchered. She used to be this cute and precious little baby, and now she turned into someone annoying, bitchy and arrogant without any meaningful connection to Violet. She was like an entitled teenager, and there’s a reason why nobody likes those.Of course, there were also other characters of whom I was really looking forward to seeing their story develop, but I didn’t get anything remotely satisfying when it came to them. Liam’s sister was only in a few scenes and in most of them she was just flat-out exasperating; everything about her character was anti-climactic.More importantly however, I feel like Dain just got completely ignored during this entire book. He used to be Violet’s best friend for such a long time and after it is revealed he didn’t even really do anything to betray her, Violet doesn’t remotely seem to care?? She doesn’t think about him and she doesn’t give him the time of day... she sort of forgives him but not really?? It was so weakly developed and I honestly expected more. It was, once again, very anti-climactic.Long story short, the only reason I somewhat enjoyed this book, and why I even finished it, is because I still felt a semblance of attachment to the story and these characters after book one, but even that wasn’t enough to keep me engaged for long enough. I couldn’t help but skim near the end of this book, because I was just so bored. I genuinely didn’t care anymore, and this book was just way too long for no reason.

It’s like the author could never seem to focus on more than a few characters at the same time, so whenever she wanted to pay attention to one side character, all the other side characters just fell away. For example: at the beginning of this book we have quite a lot of focus on Imogen, and I was really seeing some amazing progress between her and Violet. I thought I saw the start of a beautiful friendship forming between them. But then, the moment Rhiannon started coming back into the fold (after being ignored in the first part), Imogen completely fell away again and her relationship with Violet never picked up. It’s like the author couldn’t handle Violet having more than one close female friend; she couldn’t focus on both at the same time. And therefore, neither Imogen or Rhiannon ever truly felt like friends to Violet because they were often suddenly ignored in her inner monologue or in the story. They were more like decoration, like tools to further the story along. Thus, none of Violet’s friends ever feel like real characters on their own..I loved the dragons in the first book; they were my favourite part of the entire book. But now, I couldn’t care less. Tairn used to be this sassy, grumpy dad-type, but now he was just a flat, monotone character with no real personality. Everything he said was repetitive, and his entire character just seemed way too simple and lacking any sort of depth. When it came to Andarna, I genuinely think her entire character was butchered. She used to be this cute and precious little baby, and now she turned into someone annoying, bitchy and arrogant without any meaningful connection to Violet. She was like an entitled teenager, and there’s a reason why nobody likes those.Of course, there were also other characters of whom I was really looking forward to seeing their story develop, but I didn’t get anything remotely satisfying when it came to them. Liam’s sister was only in a few scenes and in most of them she was just flat-out exasperating; everything about her character was anti-climactic.More importantly however, I feel like Dain just got completely ignored during this entire book. He used to be Violet’s best friend for such a long time and after it is revealed he didn’t even really do anything to betray her, Violet doesn’t remotely seem to care?? She doesn’t think about him and she doesn’t give him the time of day... she sort of forgives him but not really?? It was so weakly developed and I honestly expected more. It was, once again, very anti-climactic.Long story short, the only reason I somewhat enjoyed this book, and why I even finished it, is because I still felt a semblance of attachment to the story and these characters after book one, but even that wasn’t enough to keep me engaged for long enough. I couldn’t help but skim near the end of this book, because I was just so bored. I genuinely didn’t care anymore, and this book was just way too long for no reason. All in all, this was one big disappointment to me.'The Empyrean' series:1.Fourth Wing- 4.5 stars2. Iron Flame - 2.0 stars --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

There's always some conflict around the corner to trip you up and send you back to square one (or often, square negative one). So, while this book gives you such excellent advice as \"learn from failure\", \"make profitable deals\", and \"work hard for yourself\", it doesn't actually give you a system or method to make money.This seems a strange irony to me, as this book is clearly marketed to people who are not smart enough to realize that they should 'work hard and not give up' if they want to succeed, but who are smart enough to be able to figure all the rest of the logistics out by themselves.Now, there are supplementary books that give a lot more in-depth information, but they still tend to fall into similar traps.

For these types, self-help and new age books act like a surrogate (or additional) religion: bolstering their self-esteem and making them feel as if their dreams are truly within reach.Then, years go by and the dream draws no nearer.

This makes them feel self-satisfied and complacent, so they end up doing nothing until suddenly, months later, they realize they're no closer to their goal.

            "Translation failed for: Fun fact, this book caught my attention because the title looked gay.I kept reading despite this because I've officially started MBA courses and I recognize that if I won't find something to love in Business, I will not be able to complete this degree, let alone succeed. That is a shame because people's amazed faces when I share my degrees is such an ego boost (which I desperately need cause cheers for crippling imposter syndrome).In short chapters, Kiyosaki shares the financial education he received from \"rich dad\", the father of one of his friends. He compares it to the financial advice his own father gave him. The argument is that most people stay unhappy with their financial situation because they don't own any assets and they end up working for others, rather than for themselves. While his own father encourages him to seek an education and a stable job, his rich father helps him become financially educated.The book is written in a very accessible way. It's clear that his target audience is frustrated people who lack knowledge and he definitely manages to make his messages come across. However repetitive, this book is short and easy.I fear this is the end of positive things I can say on this book. As others have pointed out, Kiyosaki recognizes the importance of professionals and educated people and yet, consistently bashes them. Much of this book is filled with condescending and rude rhetoric towards intellectuals and the working class.Here's the thing. Labor is necessary. With this in mind, not everyone will be able to apply these lessons because ultimately, in our current age, you're still going to need someone down the line doing the actual labor. Jeff Bezos can get richer with his assets but his entire company rests on the people working in delivery and packaging. So really, Kiyosaki's condescension makes little sense. His own company requires lawyers, accountants, etc, who are all educated people. Without workers, both educated and not, Kiyosaki's \"financial education\" means nothing. He can say these people are in the \"rat race\", that they're forever working for someone else but what he proposes seems to be \"let's gain wealth on the backs of others!\".Really, I hesitate to stand behind the \"eat the rich\" crowd but damn, studying business is making me an actual communist.In fact, I found myself grateful that I'm studying Politics, Philosophy and Economics before approaching Business. At least Economics has the dignity to pretend that it's for the benefit of others, that the market benefits from greed. Business seems to be a field for people who simply want to be rich and powerful without caring about the societal impact of their behavior (whoops, is this the right attitude to succeed in my MBA?).Now, up until the fifth chapter, I was able to excuse this book as greed inducing and that's it. However, in the fifth chapter, Kiyosaki gets into taxes. He rightfully points out that rich people don't pay taxes so that the weight of taxes fall on the shoulders of the middle class. At this point, I had hoped Kiyosaki was ready to look at the social impact of his ideas.Obviously not. Instead, Kiyosaki claims that this will always be the case because the rich are able to evade taxes. This is a confusion of normative and descriptive. It is true that the rich do not pay taxes however, is this what we ideally want? Somehow, Kiyosaki seems to feel that since the rich do tax evasion, we should all strive to be like the rich and evade tax. Doesn't it make more sense for the government to force the rich to pay the taxes?Kiyosaki seems to suggest that it's inevitable that the rich will find loopholes. However, when corporations have such an impact on politics in the US (for example, if you still have some faith in the American democracy,read this paper!), it should come as surprise to no one that they evade tax. This means that the group who is screwing people over is the rich (*coughs* rich dad is a thief), and not the government, unlike how Kiyosaki wishes to present it.Then, he talks about healthcare and old age care. Again, he portrays some of the challenges the middle class faces yet he pretty much lost the last bits of my respect when he referred to American healthcare as \"socialized\". My dude, have you looked at other developed democracies?Really, the American centric nature of this book was too much for me. Like, come on, your defunct welfare state is not something to be proud of. There are other forms of capitalism which are not socialism and do include social benefits. There are other ways to build an economy.Things don't improve from here. The book ends with more ego-stroking. To conclude, yes, financial education matters but part of financial education should be some form of social thinking. Basically, Economics and Business can't be studied alone, this is a recipe to creating selfish villains, poor dad was right all along.What I'm Taking With Me- Don't even get me started on his comments on unions.- I just have so much disdain for business. For example, in my reading today, the textbook cheerfully pointed out that some airlines have \"informal job descriptions\" where workers \"pitch in!\". The flight attendants also help clean the plane and the pilots also load luggage so the company is very cost efficient. Or in other words, the airline essentially robs workers fair payment from the labor they do. This shouldn't be applauded. Frankly, this should be illegal, what the heck does an informal job description mean? #Elizabeth_Anderson_is_right- Well, time to continue my finance homework.

His own company requires lawyers, accountants, etc, who are all educated people. Without workers, both educated and not, Kiyosaki's \"financial education\" means nothing. He can say these people are in the \"rat race\", that they're forever working for someone else but what he proposes seems to be \"let's gain wealth on the backs of others!\".Really, I hesitate to stand behind the \"eat the rich\" crowd but damn, studying business is making me an actual communist.In fact, I found myself grateful that I'm studying Politics, Philosophy and Economics before approaching Business. At least Economics has the dignity to pretend that it's for the benefit of others, that the market benefits from greed. Business seems to be a field for people who simply want to be rich and powerful without caring about the societal impact of their behavior (whoops, is this the right attitude to succeed in my MBA?).Now, up until the fifth chapter, I was able to excuse this book as greed inducing and that's it. However, in the fifth chapter, Kiyosaki gets into taxes. He rightfully points out that rich people don't pay taxes so that the weight of taxes fall on the shoulders of the middle class. At this point, I had hoped Kiyosaki was ready to look at the social impact of his ideas.Obviously not. Instead, Kiyosaki claims that this will always be the case because the rich are able to evade taxes. This is a confusion of normative and descriptive. It is true that the rich do not pay taxes however, is this what we ideally want? Somehow, Kiyosaki seems to feel that since the rich do tax evasion, we should all strive to be like the rich and evade tax. Doesn't it make more sense for the government to force the rich to pay the taxes?Kiyosaki seems to suggest that it's inevitable that the rich will find loopholes. However, when corporations have such an impact on politics in the US (for example, if you still have some faith in the American democracy,read this paper!), it should come as surprise to no one that they evade tax. This means that the group who is screwing people over is the rich (*coughs* rich dad is a thief), and not the government, unlike how Kiyosaki wishes to present it.Then, he talks about healthcare and old age care. Again, he portrays some of the challenges the middle class faces yet he pretty much lost the last bits of my respect when he referred to American healthcare as \"socialized\". My dude, have you looked at other developed democracies?Really, the American centric nature of this book was too much for me. Like, come on, your defunct welfare state is not something to be proud of. There are other forms of capitalism which are not socialism and do include social benefits. There are other ways to build an economy.Things don't improve from here. The book ends with more ego-stroking. To conclude, yes, financial education matters but part of financial education should be some form of social thinking. Basically, Economics and Business can't be studied alone, this is a recipe to creating selfish villains, poor dad was right all along.What I'm Taking With Me- Don't even get me started on his comments on unions.- I just have so much disdain for business. For example, in my reading today, the textbook cheerfully pointed out that some airlines have \"informal job descriptions\" where workers \"pitch in!\". The flight attendants also help clean the plane and the pilots also load luggage so the company is very cost efficient. Or in other words, the airline essentially robs workers fair payment from the labor they do. This shouldn't be applauded. Frankly, this should be illegal, what the heck does an informal job description mean? #Elizabeth_Anderson_is_right- Well, time to continue my finance homework. Can you guys believe I've started to keep track of the stock market? What's happening to me??-------------------------------Life in a post (???)

However, after a more careful revision and after re-reading a couple of passages, I decided this should get a solid two-star rating. The reason is simple: a one star rating, by my mind, is for a book I deem incomparably stupid and written by an imbecile who can't put a couple of words together to form an at least decent story. I have given one star ratings before, and after looking through them, I have to admit that, in my opinion, they were totally deserved.\"The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared\" is notthatbad. I didn't find anything I particularly liked about the book, or anything that would be considered \"good\" in terms of fiction, but one of my criteria for giving something one star is that it has to have horrible writing. The kind filled with adverbs (Stephen King is right, you know), where there's no sentence longer than four words, where there's no development in style or even a good old fashioned bit of text thatsorta-really-actuallyresembles another piece of writing. It wasn't like that with Jonasson's book; the writing isn't especially disgusting or in any way a horrible experience. Most of it could be turned on to the decent side, if he would just pay more attention to details. That's why, in the end, this gets two little golden shining stars.For starters, this book is absurd. And not absurd in the fictional way, not fantasy-absurd. No. Real absurd. There's nothing plausible about this work. I know, after reading it, that it was probably meant to be absurd and that in general fiction is supposed to touch on situations that might not be real, but Jonasson went out of his way to make this one really test your patience! And, frankly, it does just that - it doesn't appeal to your imagination, rather it punches your endurance right in the face and yells at her until you finally decide you've had enough. Now, don't bust my balls over this. Fiction - I do know - is notreal. But at least with good fiction, the author tries to make it as plausible as possible. In here, the absurdity was multiplied by the horrifying sense of humor that the author seemed to enjoy.I won't even bother with a full synopsis, I'll just strike through what I though were really bad moments.Apparently, Allan (the centenarian the title of the book is referring to) saved and had an eccentric dinner with general Franco, during which they came to be on first-name terms. After that, he was commanded by Roosevelt to create a bomb (hello there, nuke); he spent some time in libraries, researching in order to understand the chemical reactions that Americans were using for their weapons, and he single-handedly solved the biggest problem they had: controlling a nuclear fission. Between two sessions at that most secret library, he would serve coffee at Oppenheimer's table. While being there, as a waiter, he decided to suggest to Oppenheimer to split the uranium in two equal parts and detonate the bomb before it reached the destination. At the exact same time, Vice President Truman sort of walked into the room, found out what happened and declared Allan hero of the day, asking him to join in for a bite in Washington, at his favorite Mexican restaurant. After they drank a dubious amount of tequila, Allan and Truman were, of course, best buddies. The Vice President apparently amused Allan by imitating the pathetic attempts Roosevelt made when he tried to get up from his wheelchair. Funny, really, because some minutes later, the centenarian was there to hear the first announcement of Roosevelt's death.Does this whole scene seem plausible, in any way, to you?While we're on the subject of world leaders that Allan had dinner with, let's not forget to include Stalin and Mao; they really entertained him with amazing dinners, with the exception of Mao, who only had noodles to offer him.I mean, that always happens in normal life, right?At one point, it's also suggested that he was the one who ordered the bombing of Hiroshima, on the 6th of August 1945, though by my humble opinion, the author got the bomber model wrong. He says it's a B56, but it was a Boeing B29 Superfotress; the B56 is another kind of tactical bomber.Plus, Allan was apparently a highly intelligent man and could learn new languages in a matter of months. Originally, he was from Sweden. I understood the affinity for English, which is a simple language, for Spanish, which is not so simple but still a pretty straightforward one, but I stopped believing him at Chinese. For real, Jonasson? Also, because of how the 20th century went, I was positive he would also get to learn Russian - and I was in no way wrong. He picked it up, by his own saying, in a school named \"Gulag\". Nice joke, Jonasson. You're really making me laugh.It wasneverfunny. Not even \"sarcastic-smile\" funny. Not even \"you-should-smile-at-this-because-the-author-tried-to-be-witty\" funny. Never. Let me give you an example of what I had to sit through, page after page:\"The bad news\", said Julius, and lowered his voice a little, \"the bad news is that when we were well and truly pissed last night, we forgot to turn off the fan in the freezer-room.\"\"And?\" said Allan.\"And... the guy inside must be dead cold - or cold dead - by now.\"With a worried look, Allan scratched his neck while he decided whether to let the news of his carelessness spoil the day.\"Oh dear,\" he said. \"But, on the other hand, I must say that you've got these eggs just right, not too hard and not too runny.\"Yes. That is the wit this author brings to the table. Can't make much of it. I doubt many people can make much of it. It's nonsense, it's empty blabber, his dialogue is composed mostly of useless, senseless jokes that are supposed to evidentiate his character's philosophy of life.Which is, basically: \"it is what it is, therefore, what will be will be.\" I can't think of anything stupider than that. I'm ok with accepting what comes your way in life, but extending that philosophy to anything and everything in your path is mentally unhealthy and doesn't make for a very good fighter when life throws you something you have to struggle with.The characters' conscience seems to have been thrown out the window, because killing people becomes just a minor deficiency of their trip and is dismissed as unimportant. They never panic - they don't even scare at the sight of human bodies and they're as comfortable when disposing of them as a 50 year old experienced Russian mercenary.Then there comes an even more confusing part to the story - the elephant. Sonya (the elephant), seems to be an enriching element. Was it put into the story to give it depth? I don't know. But related to her was this book's funniest moment: the death of Bucket, a petty thief and a certified idiot. He threatened Allan with a gun, but then the centenarian man had the brilliant idea to make him slide and fall into one of Sonya's dumps and command the elephant to sit down... on top of the poor guy. Consequently, Bucket died, squashed by an elephant's butt.What was this particular Scandinavian smoking when he wrote this?!, error: My first impulse was to give this a one-star rating, and after about two seconds of thinking, I did exactly that.

            "Translation failed for: Before I start this review, I would just like to say that I understand the author was trying to make this as historically accurate as possible, and 13-year-olds getting married back in 1509 Venice is not unheard of, but this review is just my unfiltered reactions to this book, which honestly to me is like if the Kardashians had existed in the early 16th century.There will be spoilers. I'm pretty much summarizing this whole book because it's really something.The title of this book almost feels like a joke.The Virgins of Venice...more like Everyone is Pregnant in Venice.The book starts off with our MC Justina, who is in love with her brother's best friend, Luca. Luca loves her too and has proposed to her and they're just waiting for Luca's father to ask Justina's father, when Justina's father decides he has other plans. Justina's family is kind of broke. Her dad is bad at business and her brother is pretty useless as well. He starts off all nice, supporting Justina and Luca, but he's pretty much a womanizer and spends most of his time with his new fraternity, planning festas and mummaries, while also flirting with their Turkish slave Madelena. At this point in Venice I guess, if you have more than one daughter, you can only really afford the dowry for one, so the rest end up as nuns at a convent... SOThe plan is now for Justina to go to a convent and take vows to become a nun since she's more into reading and writing and would make a bad wife (*insert openeyecrylaugh emote* because apparently all of bookstagram should be sent off to a convent). Meanwhile, her 13 year-old-sister, who is a Child, should marry a man who sounds like twice her age because she's beautiful and blonde and would make a better wife?? No one can argue with Justina's father, including her mother, and we spend the first few chapters in horror watching Rosa, Justina's sister, panic about having to get married. Which honestly is a huge mood.To make matters worse, Rosa is in love with the family's Black gondolier. Now, you would think this is just a little crush. Because Rosa is only 13, there is no way it could be anything more than that. Well you thought wrong.Anyway, for some stupid reason, and apparently there is an actual source to back this up. The Zanes (who Rosa is marrying into) have agreed to consummate the marriage before the actual wedding. Why? I have no clue, but I'm gonna say its for the Drama. But it's actually more horrifying than anything, watching Justina and her family pretty much abandon this actual child, who is screaming and crying, in the Zane's house for her fiancé to do as he pleases.I've never watched Game of Thrones, but I'm assuming this is what the show is like.Rosa is miserable and barely speaks after that, which makes complete sense. I cannot imagine what she went through and then continues to go through after she gets married. After Rosa is off and married, Justina takes her vows and becomes a nun and is also rather miserable because she was the one who was supposed to get married and she misses Luca and wants to be with him.Rosa married into a very messed up family. They don't let her see her mom or sister, or let anyone visit unless Lord Zane (her husband) or his mother-in-law is there to supervise. It's blatant abuse. Rosa's husband \"visits\" her every night, sometimes multiple times, because all he cares about his having an heir, and he thinks because she's so young, she has plenty of time to give him a son. It's disgusting.Lord Zane's sister Zanetta is a nun at the convent and is actual pure evil. The convent had a recent election, and Zanetta's friend didn't end up winning, so she's bitter and walks around like she's the haram police (but make it Catholic) getting into everyone's business and trying to get them into trouble.A good middle portion of the book is kind of boring tbh. This book felt soooo long. I kept thinking I was further along than I was, only to find out I was barely 40% of the way through the book.Anyway, fast forward to literally everyone and their mother is pregnant.Rosa is pregnant and can finally sleep at night because her midwife has told her husband to be \"gentle\" with her *literally throws up*Luca had to get married super quickly cause the pope is going to attack Venice and excommunicate it from the Church, so he marries some random girl who apparently is boring and not as great as Justina, and she eventually gets pregnant.Justina's brother, Paolo, who Justina warned should be careful with Madelena because she is a slave and if she gets pregnant, their dad can do whatever he wants with her and throw her out onto the street, gets her pregnant of course.And then we have this whole drama with a courtesan who Justina's brother and dad have both frequented and did not pay her the 100 ducats she is owed. As a result, this courtesan has been sending letters asking for her money, which Justina finds, and in this letter, the courtesan gives her dad an ultimatum: give me my 100 ducats or I give me your eldest daughter and I will sell her virginity off to the highest bidder even though she's kind of ugly. Just perfect.To top all of this off...Paolo who is a womanizer and cannot just stick to one woman, went with a bunch of other guys and spent the night at another convent and got arrested. Bail is also 100 ducats. So Justina is freaking out because she knows her dad will chose her brother over her because he's the heir is trying to raise the money.Meanwhile, the family finds out about Madelena being pregnant, and Justina's dad decides to sell her to the courtesan instead who wants to make use of her after she's finished being pregnant. Yes, I know this book is really something. But the courtesan agrees to let Madelena live at the convent as Justina's maid until she has the baby. Paolo gets out of jail cause men never get punished for anything, and Luca pays off the courtesan because he and Justina have been secretly in touch through letters.Inside the convent, nothing is as it seems. Justina's aunt is also a nun and in a relationship with another nun, which Justina walks in on lol. Justina's next door cellmate is in a relationship with a carpenter. And yes, she also gets pregnant. Apparently its very normal for nuns to not really be nuns and have sex and then get pregnant and the Abbess apparently is chill with their babies being raised as orphans at the convent. She's kind of a cool Abbess. Zanetta and her posse wander around sneering at everyone and trying to listen in on your conversations.Justina's aunt pretty much tells Justina you gotta enjoy life and experience love and then ask for forgiveness from God. So Justina and Luca plan a whole outing together on her birthday. (Luca has been visiting the convent to give her updates on her family when her brother was in prison). Nothing actually happens because Luca is an honourable man, but to no one's surprise, this makes it much harder for either of them to stay apart.Justina also starts writing about life in the convent and everything she sees and hears around her, including what is happening with the Pope wanting to attack Venice, the secrets the nuns hide from the rest of the world and other heretical and sacrilegious things. She sends her writing to Luca, who thinks she's incredible and super intelligent (and I guess for her time period she would be, and the author does say her character is inspired by another nun who did publish her works), and he even helps her to find a publisher to publish her manuscript. I honestly felt like this version of Justina didn't fit well with the rest of her story. Justina, the writer is insightful and daring, arguing about the role of women in Venetian society. But irl she is completely different, mostly staying silent when Zanetta is bullying her and barely able to stand up for herself. At the same time, I feel like I’m also a completely different person in my writing than I am irl so I don’t know if I can judge.Anyway, to summarize the pregnant people in this book so far:>Rosa, Justina’s sister>Luca’s wife>Justina’s next-door cellmate>Madelena who is pregnant with Paolo’s childJustina’s next-door cellmate decides to run off with her carpenter now that she’s pregnant and sneaks off in the middle of the night. Before anyone can find out about this, an aqua alta occurs in Venice (pretty much a flood from high tides). And it just so happens Rosa is visiting at this time and her water breaks.Honestly, this was my favourite part of the book and that’s entirely because I’m an obgyn nurse. Justina rushes her off to the infirmary and tries to send a pregnant Madelena out to get their midwife, but the water is too high. So instead, Justina goes next door where Luca lives (yes, I know, very convenient), and it just so happens that Luca’s wife has gotten a new midwife who was just visiting. Luca calls Justina by her first name, which is Scandal and Luca’s wife notices. And then he offers to escort Justina and the midwife back.The midwife turns out to be Jewish (a lot of Jews escape Padua when it was attacked by the Pope and came to Venice), but they welcome her into the convent anyway cause they’re desperate. And then we get to the good stuff. The baby is in the wrong position, so the midwife performs an external cephalic version (which I was quite impressed with) and turned the baby head down. The baby eventually comes out and the midwife hands her over to the nun who runs the infirmary. There is no sound of a cry and instead the focus is returned to Rosa and trying to save her life. From the description it looks like she possibly had a postpartum hemorrhage because this involved a lot of fundal massages and whatnot, but Rosa does live (though the midwife informs her she will not be able to have more kids so I cannot imagine the damage this child did to this poor 13-year old kid), except the baby dies.I should add btw…Rosa’s mother-in-law came with her to the convent and is waiting to hear about this kid. Justina picks up the bundle, pulls back the cloth. And turns out…the baby is Black. I literally just sat there shook for a moment because it did not cross my mind that a 13 year old would willingly have sex because that is a child and I thought at most she had a huge crush on Teodor (the gondolier), but nope, apparently she wanted to feel what true love was before she was forced to marry Lord Zane and had sex with him.So now the panicking starts because Rosa’s mother-in-law will want to see her and the baby, even if the baby is dead. So they decide to tell her that the baby’s face is deformed because they had to pull the baby out quickly to save Rosa’s life, so that’s why the face is covered, and most likely no one will pull back the cover to see the baby’s skin colour. Rosa also wants them to bring Teodor to the convent so he can see his child he didn’t know existed.Rosa’s mother-in-law arrives, holds the bundle, informs Rosa that Lord Zane will like to see the baby too and they will bury her in their family graveyard. So everyone starts panicking again because surely they’ll see what the baby looks like at the funeral, so after Rosa’s mother-in-law leaves and Teodor comes to see the baby, they bury the baby in the convent graveyard with the excuse that Rosa is now seeking shelter at the convent from her husband (fair) and she wants the baby buried close to her since she refuses to go back to her husband.We get a scene later on with Lord Zane furious and at the convent demanding his wife be returned to him (he doesn’t care if she needs to heal and can’t even walk). But I love this Abbess and she stands him down and tells him to go ahead and call his lawyers, except she runs this convent and he can’t do anything. Justina and Rosa’s parents come, and her dad tries to convince her to go back to her husband, but Rosa decides to stay.We eventually get a scene where Paolo comes to tell Justina the news that he’s going to the battle front to do mostly admin work and he wants to bring Madelena with him for enjoyment purposes. Madelena is amazing and refuses. The courtesan has offered to buy her freedom, and she realizes she can do more with her freedom than she can as a slave mistress for a nobleman. She makes Paolo promise that if she has a boy he will find him an apprenticeship and if it’s a girl, she’ll get to stay at the convent with Justina. Paolo is upset for one second and then asks Justina where her next-door cellmate is because she’s really pretty. Anyway, I hate him a lot. All he cares about is pleasure and sex and he takes no consideration into how it affects the women around him. When Rosa was freaking out about her marriage, he just told her that she needs to get over it and adjust and it’ll be fine. And when she refuses to go back to Lord Zane after her delivery, he acts like he can’t understand why his 13-year old sister would feel uncomfortable around a man twice her age who is only interested in bedding her until he gets a son. He’s gross and I hate him.Luckily for us, he dies at the front like two pages later. And this is when things get spicy!Luca comes to deliver the news. Justina is upset for one second, and then she’s like “Screw it! I’m gonna have sex with Luca” and she tells Luca this, and Luca is like “omg yes let’s do this instead of crying over your brother/my best friend dying”. So they make plans for him to climb the wall and meet her in the courtyard at night.Now Justina thinks about telling Rosa and her aunt about her brother’s death, but realizes if she tells them, they’ll want to spend the night together praying and crying and that’ll ruin her sex plans of course. SO…she decides, whatever, she’ll tell them tomorrow morning and pretend she spent the night too upset to leave her room like 💀 I am all for hating Paolo, but seriously??Anyway, Luca sneaks over, they have sex like three times. Justina has a hard time staying quiet. Apparently, Luca’s wife doesn’t enjoy sex with him. I really cared about that.And then just when he’s about to leave, they open the door and there is Zanetta.I was waiting for a showdown between Zanetta and Justina, and this was the most disappointing thing in the entire world. She threatens to expose them. Venice has new laws that will result in Luca being exiled and he’s just gotten a great position in the Council and has a baby on the way (in case anyone forgot). And what happens to Justina is up to the Abbess, but pretty sure Zanetta would make her life hell. Zanetta also points out that she knows Justina’s aunt was in a relationship with her best nun friend, and that she has plans to become the next abbess. She also knows about Justina’s sacrilegious writing because she snoops around Justina’s room. And she knows about Justina sneaking off to meet Luca that one other time. And she’s starting to get suspicious about Rosa burying her baby in the garden…So instead of pushing her down the stairs or something, Justina ruins the lives of everyone around her. She promises to make her aunt not run for Abbess. She promises Zanetta that she will convince Rosa to go back to Lord Zane (Zanetta’s brother). She also promises to never see Luca again and to confess and repent. And finally, she promises to burn her manuscript.It was the stupidest thing I’ve ever read. And all we get after this is that Justina realizes Zanetta was in love with Luca all along and she’s bitter she never got to be with him and everyone around her was doing whatever they wanted with no consequences, so she is bitter and making everyone else’s lives miserable.So after throwing everyone under the bus, Luca leaves, Justina burns her manuscript, she confesses and then life moves on. She tells Rosa what happened, and Rosa is like “oh I was getting bored here and was thinking of going back anyway” like ???? girl you literally hate it there and were miserable?? At least you have ten times more freedom at the convent?? Justina’s aunt is like “okay fine, I won’t become abbess because after my girlfriend died I think everyone is suspicious we were together so I probably won’t win the election”. And that’s it.A few years pass. Rosa has a boy. How she gets pregnant and safely delivers a baby after the midwife said she couldn’t, I have no idea. But apparently now she really can’t get pregnant again, and she tells her mom that Lord Zane doesn’t visit her anymore and she’s been finally able to get some sleep 🥴 Her mom seems shocked that Rosa would be happy about this, which is such a mom thing. Madelena had a girl, and Justina’s mom is kind of warming up to Madelena because her daughter looks like Paolo a bit. Justina is writing again, but this time it’s less inflammatory and more about day-to-day life in the convent and she doesn’t plan to publish it anymore. Luca apparently took some of her manuscript before it was burned and has had it printed anonymously…something about educating your daughters and it’s causing quite a stir. Justina has forgiven her father for some reason, though technically it’s all his fault. She’s still in love with Luca, but nothing will happen with that and The End.It was a weird conclusion. This whole book was weird. And it was waaay too long. I honestly felt like I was watching a reality tv show set in early 1500s Venice. I wish we got more about the politics of the time. The Pope fighting and attacking cities and excommunicating them was definitely more interesting.Overall, 2 stars because of the external cephalic version and fundal massage. I hope this review is a good enough summary for those of you who don’t want to go through the trouble of reading this book., error: Before I start this review, I would just like to say that I understand the author was trying to make this as historically accurate as possible, and 13-year-olds getting married back in 1509 Venice is not unheard of, but this review is just my unfiltered reactions to this book, which honestly to me is like if the Kardashians had existed in the early 16th century.There will be spoilers. I'm pretty much summarizing this whole book because it's really something.The title of this book almost feels like a joke.The Virgins of Venice...more like Everyone is Pregnant in Venice.The book starts off with our MC Justina, who is in love with her brother's best friend, Luca. Luca loves her too and has proposed to her and they're just waiting for Luca's father to ask Justina's father, when Justina's father decides he has other plans. Justina's family is kind of broke. Her dad is bad at business and her brother is pretty useless as well. He starts off all nice, supporting Justina and Luca, but he's pretty much a womanizer and spends most of his time with his new fraternity, planning festas and mummaries, while also flirting with their Turkish slave Madelena. At this point in Venice I guess, if you have more than one daughter, you can only really afford the dowry for one, so the rest end up as nuns at a convent... SOThe plan is now for Justina to go to a convent and take vows to become a nun since she's more into reading and writing and would make a bad wife (*insert openeyecrylaugh emote* because apparently all of bookstagram should be sent off to a convent). Meanwhile, her 13 year-old-sister, who is a Child, should marry a man who sounds like twice her age because she's beautiful and blonde and would make a better wife?? No one can argue with Justina's father, including her mother, and we spend the first few chapters in horror watching Rosa, Justina's sister, panic about having to get married. Which honestly is a huge mood.To make matters worse, Rosa is in love with the family's Black gondolier. Now, you would think this is just a little crush. Because Rosa is only 13, there is no way it could be anything more than that. Well you thought wrong.Anyway, for some stupid reason, and apparently there is an actual source to back this up. The Zanes (who Rosa is marrying into) have agreed to consummate the marriage before the actual wedding. Why? I have no clue, but I'm gonna say its for the Drama. But it's actually more horrifying than anything, watching Justina and her family pretty much abandon this actual child, who is screaming and crying, in the Zane's house for her fiancé to do as he pleases.I've never watched Game of Thrones, but I'm assuming this is what the show is like.Rosa is miserable and barely speaks after that, which makes complete sense. I cannot imagine what she went through and then continues to go through after she gets married. After Rosa is off and married, Justina takes her vows and becomes a nun and is also rather miserable because she was the one who was supposed to get married and she misses Luca and wants to be with him.Rosa married into a very messed up family. They don't let her see her mom or sister, or let anyone visit unless Lord Zane (her husband) or his mother-in-law is there to supervise. It's blatant abuse. Rosa's husband \"visits\" her every night, sometimes multiple times, because all he cares about his having an heir, and he thinks because she's so young, she has plenty of time to give him a son. It's disgusting.Lord Zane's sister Zanetta is a nun at the convent and is actual pure evil. The convent had a recent election, and Zanetta's friend didn't end up winning, so she's bitter and walks around like she's the haram police (but make it Catholic) getting into everyone's business and trying to get them into trouble.A good middle portion of the book is kind of boring tbh. This book felt soooo long. I kept thinking I was further along than I was, only to find out I was barely 40% of the way through the book.Anyway, fast forward to literally everyone and their mother is pregnant.Rosa is pregnant and can finally sleep at night because her midwife has told her husband to be \"gentle\" with her *literally throws up*Luca had to get married super quickly cause the pope is going to attack Venice and excommunicate it from the Church, so he marries some random girl who apparently is boring and not as great as Justina, and she eventually gets pregnant.Justina's brother, Paolo, who Justina warned should be careful with Madelena because she is a slave and if she gets pregnant, their dad can do whatever he wants with her and throw her out onto the street, gets her pregnant of course.And then we have this whole drama with a courtesan who Justina's brother and dad have both frequented and did not pay her the 100 ducats she is owed. As a result, this courtesan has been sending letters asking for her money, which Justina finds, and in this letter, the courtesan gives her dad an ultimatum: give me my 100 ducats or I give me your eldest daughter and I will sell her virginity off to the highest bidder even though she's kind of ugly. Just perfect.To top all of this off...Paolo who is a womanizer and cannot just stick to one woman, went with a bunch of other guys and spent the night at another convent and got arrested. Bail is also 100 ducats. So Justina is freaking out because she knows her dad will chose her brother over her because he's the heir is trying to raise the money.Meanwhile, the family finds out about Madelena being pregnant, and Justina's dad decides to sell her to the courtesan instead who wants to make use of her after she's finished being pregnant. Yes, I know this book is really something. But the courtesan agrees to let Madelena live at the convent as Justina's maid until she has the baby. Paolo gets out of jail cause men never get punished for anything, and Luca pays off the courtesan because he and Justina have been secretly in touch through letters.Inside the convent, nothing is as it seems. Justina's aunt is also a nun and in a relationship with another nun, which Justina walks in on lol. Justina's next door cellmate is in a relationship with a carpenter. And yes, she also gets pregnant. Apparently its very normal for nuns to not really be nuns and have sex and then get pregnant and the Abbess apparently is chill with their babies being raised as orphans at the convent. She's kind of a cool Abbess. Zanetta and her posse wander around sneering at everyone and trying to listen in on your conversations.Justina's aunt pretty much tells Justina you gotta enjoy life and experience love and then ask for forgiveness from God. So Justina and Luca plan a whole outing together on her birthday. (Luca has been visiting the convent to give her updates on her family when her brother was in prison). Nothing actually happens because Luca is an honourable man, but to no one's surprise, this makes it much harder for either of them to stay apart.Justina also starts writing about life in the convent and everything she sees and hears around her, including what is happening with the Pope wanting to attack Venice, the secrets the nuns hide from the rest of the world and other heretical and sacrilegious things. She sends her writing to Luca, who thinks she's incredible and super intelligent (and I guess for her time period she would be, and the author does say her character is inspired by another nun who did publish her works), and he even helps her to find a publisher to publish her manuscript. I honestly felt like this version of Justina didn't fit well with the rest of her story. Justina, the writer is insightful and daring, arguing about the role of women in Venetian society. But irl she is completely different, mostly staying silent when Zanetta is bullying her and barely able to stand up for herself. At the same time, I feel like I’m also a completely different person in my writing than I am irl so I don’t know if I can judge.Anyway, to summarize the pregnant people in this book so far:>Rosa, Justina’s sister>Luca’s wife>Justina’s next-door cellmate>Madelena who is pregnant with Paolo’s childJustina’s next-door cellmate decides to run off with her carpenter now that she’s pregnant and sneaks off in the middle of the night. Before anyone can find out about this, an aqua alta occurs in Venice (pretty much a flood from high tides). And it just so happens Rosa is visiting at this time and her water breaks.Honestly, this was my favourite part of the book and that’s entirely because I’m an obgyn nurse. Justina rushes her off to the infirmary and tries to send a pregnant Madelena out to get their midwife, but the water is too high. So instead, Justina goes next door where Luca lives (yes, I know, very convenient), and it just so happens that Luca’s wife has gotten a new midwife who was just visiting. Luca calls Justina by her first name, which is Scandal and Luca’s wife notices. And then he offers to escort Justina and the midwife back.The midwife turns out to be Jewish (a lot of Jews escape Padua when it was attacked by the Pope and came to Venice), but they welcome her into the convent anyway cause they’re desperate. And then we get to the good stuff. The baby is in the wrong position, so the midwife performs an external cephalic version (which I was quite impressed with) and turned the baby head down. The baby eventually comes out and the midwife hands her over to the nun who runs the infirmary. There is no sound of a cry and instead the focus is returned to Rosa and trying to save her life. From the description it looks like she possibly had a postpartum hemorrhage because this involved a lot of fundal massages and whatnot, but Rosa does live (though the midwife informs her she will not be able to have more kids so I cannot imagine the damage this child did to this poor 13-year old kid), except the baby dies.I should add btw…Rosa’s mother-in-law came with her to the convent and is waiting to hear about this kid. Justina picks up the bundle, pulls back the cloth. And turns out…the baby is Black. I literally just sat there shook for a moment because it did not cross my mind that a 13 year old would willingly have sex because that is a child and I thought at most she had a huge crush on Teodor (the gondolier), but nope, apparently she wanted to feel what true love was before she was forced to marry Lord Zane and had sex with him.So now the panicking starts because Rosa’s mother-in-law will want to see her and the baby, even if the baby is dead. So they decide to tell her that the baby’s face is deformed because they had to pull the baby out quickly to save Rosa’s life, so that’s why the face is covered, and most likely no one will pull back the cover to see the baby’s skin colour. Rosa also wants them to bring Teodor to the convent so he can see his child he didn’t know existed.Rosa’s mother-in-law arrives, holds the bundle, informs Rosa that Lord Zane will like to see the baby too and they will bury her in their family graveyard. So everyone starts panicking again because surely they’ll see what the baby looks like at the funeral, so after Rosa’s mother-in-law leaves and Teodor comes to see the baby, they bury the baby in the convent graveyard with the excuse that Rosa is now seeking shelter at the convent from her husband (fair) and she wants the baby buried close to her since she refuses to go back to her husband.We get a scene later on with Lord Zane furious and at the convent demanding his wife be returned to him (he doesn’t care if she needs to heal and can’t even walk). But I love this Abbess and she stands him down and tells him to go ahead and call his lawyers, except she runs this convent and he can’t do anything. Justina and Rosa’s parents come, and her dad tries to convince her to go back to her husband, but Rosa decides to stay.We eventually get a scene where Paolo comes to tell Justina the news that he’s going to the battle front to do mostly admin work and he wants to bring Madelena with him for enjoyment purposes. Madelena is amazing and refuses. The courtesan has offered to buy her freedom, and she realizes she can do more with her freedom than she can as a slave mistress for a nobleman. She makes Paolo promise that if she has a boy he will find him an apprenticeship and if it’s a girl, she’ll get to stay at the convent with Justina. Paolo is upset for one second and then asks Justina where her next-door cellmate is because she’s really pretty. Anyway, I hate him a lot. All he cares about is pleasure and sex and he takes no consideration into how it affects the women around him. When Rosa was freaking out about her marriage, he just told her that she needs to get over it and adjust and it’ll be fine. And when she refuses to go back to Lord Zane after her delivery, he acts like he can’t understand why his 13-year old sister would feel uncomfortable around a man twice her age who is only interested in bedding her until he gets a son. He’s gross and I hate him.Luckily for us, he dies at the front like two pages later. And this is when things get spicy!Luca comes to deliver the news. Justina is upset for one second, and then she’s like “Screw it! I’m gonna have sex with Luca” and she tells Luca this, and Luca is like “omg yes let’s do this instead of crying over your brother/my best friend dying”. So they make plans for him to climb the wall and meet her in the courtyard at night.Now Justina thinks about telling Rosa and her aunt about her brother’s death, but realizes if she tells them, they’ll want to spend the night together praying and crying and that’ll ruin her sex plans of course. SO…she decides, whatever, she’ll tell them tomorrow morning and pretend she spent the night too upset to leave her room like 💀 I am all for hating Paolo, but seriously??Anyway, Luca sneaks over, they have sex like three times. Justina has a hard time staying quiet. Apparently, Luca’s wife doesn’t enjoy sex with him. I really cared about that.And then just when he’s about to leave, they open the door and there is Zanetta.I was waiting for a showdown between Zanetta and Justina, and this was the most disappointing thing in the entire world. She threatens to expose them. Venice has new laws that will result in Luca being exiled and he’s just gotten a great position in the Council and has a baby on the way (in case anyone forgot). And what happens to Justina is up to the Abbess, but pretty sure Zanetta would make her life hell. Zanetta also points out that she knows Justina’s aunt was in a relationship with her best nun friend, and that she has plans to become the next abbess. She also knows about Justina’s sacrilegious writing because she snoops around Justina’s room. And she knows about Justina sneaking off to meet Luca that one other time. And she’s starting to get suspicious about Rosa burying her baby in the garden…So instead of pushing her down the stairs or something, Justina ruins the lives of everyone around her. She promises to make her aunt not run for Abbess. She promises Zanetta that she will convince Rosa to go back to Lord Zane (Zanetta’s brother). She also promises to never see Luca again and to confess and repent. And finally, she promises to burn her manuscript.It was the stupidest thing I’ve ever read. And all we get after this is that Justina realizes Zanetta was in love with Luca all along and she’s bitter she never got to be with him and everyone around her was doing whatever they wanted with no consequences, so she is bitter and making everyone else’s lives miserable.So after throwing everyone under the bus, Luca leaves, Justina burns her manuscript, she confesses and then life moves on.

            "Translation failed for: Oh, what a difference the second half of a book can make.I want to be clear on this: when I was still only halfway through the book, I considered it a keeper. Penelope was wonderful: truly shy around anyone she didn't know well, with a few horribly painful/embarrassing moments in her life that Quinn actually took the time to show. I cringed in sympathy when Penelope came upon Colin just as he was telling his brothers that he wouldn't marry her and Penelope did what she could to preserve her dignity and not make it too obvious that he had just crushed her dreams. I enjoyed watching Penelope blossom as she resigned herself to being an old maid. Her friendship with Lady Danbury warmed my heart, and I loved it when they both confessed to attending horrible Smith-Smythe musicales so that the one Smith-Smythe girl who realized they were awful would have someone in the audience who was not making fun of her.I loved Colin, too. He was a nice guy, and never hurt Penelope on purpose. He felt miserable when she overheard him saying that he wouldn't marry her – it's just that he was too immature, at that point in his life, to know how to best handle the situation. Later on in their lives, when there was another moment when he could have accidentally hurt her feelings, she stopped him, and he took that time to think about the potential consequences of his actions and how Penelope might be hurt by them. Then he deliberately did his best not to hurt her. Colin wasn't in love with Penelope then and hadn't yet realized that a wonderful person had been right under his nose for years, but he still liked her, and I could have hugged him for the kind and thoughtful way he handled that moment.There's no way I can properly gripe about what Quinn did in the second half (last third?) of the book without spoiling things, so, if you don't like spoilers, stop reading this review at this point (or, more accurately, don't click the \"spoiler\" link).There are a few things I really hate coming across in romance novels. Widowed heroes or heroines still mourning the loss of their first spouses, babies and young children, very pregnant heroines, heroines whose physical description likens them to children, and...main characters who are writers. I've only encountered one author, Nora Roberts, who I can consistently trust to include any of these things without raising my hackles.Romancing Mister Bridgertonhas shown me that I can't add Quinn to my short list.I was wondering where the book was going to go when, a little over halfway through it, Colin was already giddily insisting upon marrying Penelope and trying to get it through her mother's skull that, yes, he really did want to marry Penelope and not her sister Felicity. Then I found out, as Quinn revealed the big secret: Penelope is Lady Whistledown, the woman who had been anonymously skewering the ton for 11 years.I could have lived with this revelation (although I was annoyed that Quinn kept the reader in the dark via artificial means, by simply never having Penelope think about it). In fact, I enjoyed some of the angst that came from Penelope wondering if Colin was ashamed of her because of her work as Lady Whistledown. However, I felt that Lady Whistledown and writing in general then hijacked the story.This book has a grand total of one sex scene, which occurs prior to Colin and Penelope's marriage. They spend 70 pages of the book married – most authors would have found a way to fit a sex scene, even a fade to black one, in those 70 pages. I'm usually on the side of “more sweet romantic moments, less sex,” so I wouldn't necessarily have minded that Quinn only included one sex scene, if it weren't for the fact that it felt like there could, maybe should, have been one, and it was glossed over. Here is the moment when the book really made me angry:“The wedding had been magical. It was a small affair, much to the dismay of London society. And the wedding night—well, that had been magical, too.And, in fact, marriage was magical, Colin was a wonderful husband—teasing, gentle, attentive...Except when the topic of Lady Whistledown arose.” (298)There were still 70 pages to go in the book. I had to reread the passage just to be sure that, yes, Quinn really had just glossed over Penelope and Colin's wedding, wedding night, and at least the first few days of their marriage...all because Lady Whistledown was suddenly the more important part of the book. Seriously??I finished the book because I do not DNF books when I'm that close to finishing them, but when I reached page 298 I decided that I could care less about all the Lady Whistledown stuff. I also began to find Colin's jealousy over Penelope being published (anonymously published, but still published) annoying. The writerly ego stroking scene that occurred when Colin finally let Penelope read his writings and she, of course, found them wonderful made me want to gag. That's probably a personal thing – I have a feeling that, if Colin had been worried about Penelope's reception of, say, his woodworking skills, I would have felt more sympathetic. Quinn just hit the wrong buttons with me when she made not one, but both her main characters writers, and then made that aspect an important part of the book. And, of course, Colin's writing was wonderful through and through – another thing that got my back up.Others may not feel the same way about the ending that I did.

But they didn't. I don't dislike them really, I'm just like “meh ok, go do your thing in your corner”. The secondary characers also had so much potential yet they eventually became a distant memory.

He’s literally the only reason I didn't call this book a dnf and spare myself the stress pimples., error: I’ve got like, two feelings about this book and not all of them are good.I'm trying to come to terms with the possibility that I will never form a meaningful emotional connection with a Marissa Meyer book like I did with The Lunar Chronicles. It's like my heart closes for maintenance when it comes to anything else written by this author. I don't know. There must have been a dimensional hiccup in the timeline—how else could I go from being unambiguously and obsessively 100% full scale high key addicted to her books to just....being an aggressively disinterested bystander?Aaaaad here's why:✨THE ‘MEH’ FACTOR:Renegades was one big conglomerate of timeworn clichés and hackneyed superhero tropes, which would have gotten me so pumped—like, who cares? it’s time to read about overthrowing the government and burning the patriarchy to the ground—if at least the MCs managed to scratch a line into my heart. But they didn't. I don't dislike them really, I'm just like “meh ok, go do your thing in your corner”. The secondary characers also had so much potential yet they eventually became a distant memory. They kind of just existed in the nook of the MCs', like some ghosts of goodwill. No witty banter to make them stand out or anything. There were like two characters who would’ve made this book a lot better but none of them were given enough backstory or enough page time..Honestly, I think the main problem is that when I think about this book…I don’t feel anything. My mind just blanks and all I feel is hollow wind blowing through my skull because it's just kind of there... trying so hard but failing to leave even the most basic impression upon my psyche. Yes, it was fun to read for a couple of pages but the love just isn’t there. Swipe left.✨IT WAS TEXTBOOK KIND OF LONGOne of the biggest disconnects from this book is how much pages it took. You could shrink up at least 40% of it into a little nice blot. Instead, it was too long and too introductory and I kept losing track of the story after 10 consecutive pages of redundant descriptions. I was just SO BORED. I couldn't read a couple of pages without also being on my phone watching vine compilations.✨C FOR CLICHE:I really wish there was a camera following me around 24/7 so whenever something completely predictable and unoriginal happened, so I could look directly into the camera like in The Office.• This is your painfullytypicalSupervillains vs Superheroes story.

I think this book will appeal to a lot of people, but at the same time will turn others off. I was, for the most part, turned off. I really don't think it is my kind of book, which is strange considering dystopian is my favorite sub-genre. And if I'm really being honest here, I feel a little conned by this being marketed as dystopian. Sci-Fi, yes. Dystopian, no. Maybe post-apocalyptic, but even that is pushing it. Recently, another GoodReads reviewerMargreviewed this book and her feelings regarding it's placement in the dystopian genre mirror my own.Aria lives in a world where her people live in pods and fear the outside world dubbed The Death Shop due to the cannibals and Aether storms that wreak havoc on the land. Her people spend almost all of their time in virtual reality Realms rarely attempting to live in the Real. One day Aria is exiled from her pod city, Reverie, and embarks on a journey with an outsider named Perry to find her way back into her society.The premise ofUnder the Never Skyvaguely reminds me ofThe Reality Bugbecause it has the same general idea of people in the future too busy in their virtual reality worlds to come outside and play. So, I was excited to readUnder the Never Skybecause the possibilities with it are endless and I applaud Rossi for going outside the YA \"box\" and doing something different. Unfortunately, I don't think that potential was really tapped into in this book. But I'm getting ahead of myself. What I really want to talk about is what I did like first.I did like the characters. In fact, I liked them all except for Aria. I think Perry was well-developed and I felt I could easily sympathize with his situation throughout the novel. Roar, a good friend of Perry's that we meet halfway through the book, was awesome. I loved his humor and I always felt like I enjoyed the scenes best that involved him. Aria fell short for me. I understand she was going through a lot in the story, but I never really felt connected to her. Though, admittingly, this could have to do with the fact that I'm not a fan of third person PoV narratives. Still, I found Aria rather annoying in the beginning. For example, there is one scene in the novel where she and Perry are stopping to rest in a cave and Perry tells her to stay in the cave so he can hunt. Now, Aria has zero survival skills because she has never needed them ever, but what does she do? She wanders on her own in search of berries. Did she stop to think they could be poisonous? NO. How about a wild animal mauling her to death? NO. Or maybe even getting lost? NO. As a result of her little adventure, she ends up getting her and Perry in a serious bind. So, along with survival skills, people living in pods also do not possess common sense either. *sigh* Thankfully, there *is* character growth for her and she did grow on me by the end of the book. I wouldn't call us BFFs, but I no longer had the urge to fling my Kindle across the room.I also enjoyed how Rossi played with the Outsiders having heightened senses. Perry, in particular, has a heightened sense of smell enabling him to smell emotions. That was pretty cool, but there were a few awkward parts with regards to this special skill. Like, say, knowing when your female companion is on her period. Yikes! Talk about uncomfortable. Other than that, there were times when it felt like he was one *sniff* away from becoming man's best friend. *sniff* Just throw him the damn ball, Aria!Whose a good boy, Perry? You are!That is pretty much where the \"likes\" end for me friends.So, let's cut to the chase and get down to it. Two words: World Building. If you are reading a dystopian novel there are a few things that are kinda, sorta important. We need to know what stuff is, how it works, why the world has come to be where it is, information about how the society is run, ect. You know, basic dystopian elements. That is where this book lacks the most. The reader is flung into the story, head first, without any background information. We don't know what caused Aria's society to live in pods. We know nothing about her society except that they have these realms. We know nothing about the Aether or the Unity. This is the most background information we are given:The Aether didn’t look like something that could put an end to the world, yet that had nearly happened during the Unity.And speaking of the Aether, that angered me the most. It is talked about ALL THE TIME, but it is NEVER EXPLAINED. What is an Aether storm? I don't know and neither will you. Unless, of course, you are a mind reader. If you are, please share the secrets of this universe with me! There were so many holes in the story that I justcould.not.compute. Throwing around capitalized words does not impress me.The writing style was another issue for me. I had a lot of trouble getting into the beginning. In fact, I almost wanted to give up, but I was told to stick with it because \"the beginning is rough, but it's worth it in the end.\" Hmm...Ok, yeah. I didn't see it that way. I'd say a little more than the first half is very rough. I found it difficult to keep up with what was going one because not a lot of time is used to describe what was happening.

            "Translation failed for: Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||Pinterest🦇 Read for theUnapologetic Romance ReadersHalloween 2018 Reading Challengefor the category of:A post-apocalyptic romance🦇When it comes to genres with a lot of hype, like romance and YA, there's a bit of an \"Emperor's new clothes\" phenomenon in that some people just seem to get sucked up into all of the praise and excitement and end up rating the bookhigherbecause of how their experience of reading it ties into the crowd mentality. I also think that with some of the so-called \"brainy\" books, people mistake confusion for intricacy. How else to explain why so many people thoughtLOSTwas brilliant? (Sorry if you likeLOST.)UNDER THE NEVER SKY has a bit of both when it comes to these two phenomenons. It came hot on the coattails of THE HUNGER GAMES's dystopian popularity, and despite its incredibly shoddy world-building (which I'll be talking about shortly), people have been praising it for being complex. Um, maybe, but that doesn't necessarily mean good. A knot can be complex, but if your instructions were supposed to be a bow and you did a knot anyway, and nobody around you can untangle it, you didn't really do what you were told to do, and it defeats the purpose.UNDER THE NEVER SKY is set in a post-apocalyptic world, on what I'm assuming is Earth. The sky is full of something called \"Aether,\" which I'm guessing is a solar storm. I'm also guessing that being in such close proximity to these probably-radioactive (again, never explicitly spelled-out) rays forced humanity into hiding. The heroine, Aria, is one of these: her people are the Dwellers and they live in pods that shield them from the desert and the skies, and to keep from growing insanely bored they have retreated into virtual reality worlds called Realms for their entertainment.On the other hand, you have Outsiders, or people who don't live in the pods and continue to forage in the ruins of humanity like hunter-gatherers. Dwellers derogatorily refer to them as Savages. They are tattooed, and a lot of them have X-Men-like powers, which I think they refer to as Scires. The hero, Perry, is one of these. He has two superpowers, the ability to smell \"tempers,\" or emotions, and acute vision. If this sounds familiar, yeah, it's a bit like what happened inTHE DARKEST MINDS, and I'm guessing it's because of radiation that humans ended up evolving like this, because what other explanation is there? The author certainly didn't provide insight into how humanity diverged, or why.The story kicks off when a bunch of teens go out to be wild, as teens do, and Aria ends up taking the fall for the leader's son. She gets kicked out of her pod, and left to die in the desert. Here, she meets Perry, who saved her from death already. The way she treats him is pretty awful and until they suddenly decide they are in love, both of them basically hate each others' guts. Aria thinks he's a meanie savage and Perry thinks she's an over-entitled shit who is too stupid to live. I must admit, my sympathies lay more with Perry - especially when Aria plunges headfirst into a coven of cannibals.I've read a lot of YA dystopian novels and I think UNDER THE NEVER SKY has more in common with the bad ones than the good ones. THE DARKEST MINDS andSHATTER MEalso featured dumb-as-dirt heroines in dystopian/post-apoc worlds where humans suddenly developed super powers for no apparent reason, and in both of those books as well as this one, the lazy world-building ruined the story for me because the abundance of plotholes kept pulling me out of the story to ask, \"WHY?\" I also think that if you're going to write a post-apocalyptic novel, you need to answer the hows and whys of how the world was destroyed. This is a qualm I had about the Ritchie sisters'THE RAGING ONES, where both the timeline of the inciting eventandthe world-building are equally unclear. You can have post-apocalyptic novels where the end world has little in common with the original. I think one of the crowning examples of this is A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ, which is told in three parts, and features society rebuilding itself in the wake of a nuclear holocaust, first as hunter-gatherers, then as a Medieval society, and then, if I remember correctly, as a futuristic one. Margaret Atwood's MaddAdam trilogy is another example, where genetic and technologic manipulation have basically caused society to implode, warping the natural into the unnatural. But both of these books, which I liked incidentally, had solid answers for the hows and the whys.UNDER THE NEVER SKY has some interesting ideas but fails to execute them properly. Too many things were left unanswered, and the story was not really all that different from other HUNGER GAMES copycats who wanted to create that same dystopian environment without adding the same amount of stakes, world-building, or character development. The result? A painful drag of a read.2 stars, error: Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||Pinterest🦇 Przeczytaj dla czytelników romansów bez skrupułówWyzwanie czytelnicze Halloween 2018 dla kategorii:Romans postapokaliptyczny🦇Jeśli chodzi o gatunki, w których jest dużo szumu, takie jak romanse i YA, istnieje zjawisko „nowych szat cesarza”, ponieważ niektórzy ludzie po prostu dają się wciągnąć w pochwały i emocje i ostatecznie oceniają książkę wyżej ze względu na to, jak ich doświadczenie czytania wpisuje się w mentalność tłumu. Myślę również, że w przypadku niektórych tak zwanych „mądrych” książek ludzie mylą zagmatwanie ze złożonością. Jak inaczej wytłumaczyć, dlaczego tak wiele osób uważa, że ​​LOST jest genialne? (Przepraszam, jeśli lubisz LOST.)UNDER THE NEVER SKY ma trochę obu, jeśli chodzi o te dwa zjawiska. Pojawił się na fali popularności dystopijnych Igrzysk Śmierci i pomimo jego niewiarygodnie tandetnego budowania świata (o czym wkrótce opowiem), ludzie chwalili go za złożoność. No cóż, może, ale to niekoniecznie oznacza, że ​​jest dobry. Węzeł może być skomplikowany, ale jeśli twoje instrukcje miały być kokardą, a ty i tak zrobiłeś węzeł, a nikt w twoim otoczeniu nie potrafi go rozplątać, to tak naprawdę nie zrobiłeś tego, co ci kazano, i to mija się z celem. UNDER THE NEVER SKY rozgrywa się w postapokaliptycznym świecie, na tym, co zakładam, że jest Ziemią. Niebo jest pełne czegoś zwanego „eterem”, co, jak przypuszczam, jest burzą słoneczną. Przypuszczam również, że bycie w tak bliskiej odległości od tych prawdopodobnie radioaktywnych (ponownie, nigdy nie jest to wyraźnie określone) promieni zmusiło ludzkość do ukrycia się. Bohaterka, Aria, jest jedną z nich: jej lud to Dwellers, którzy żyją w kapsułach, które chronią ich przed pustynią i niebem, a aby nie nudzić się do granic możliwości, wycofali się do wirtualnych światów zwanych Realms, aby się rozerwać. Z drugiej strony mamy Outsiders, czyli ludzi, którzy nie mieszkają w kapsułach i nadal żerują w ruinach ludzkości jak łowcy-zbieracze. Dwellers nazywają ich pogardliwie Savages. Są wytatuowani, a wielu z nich ma moce podobne do X-Men, które, jak sądzę, nazywają Scires. Bohater, Perry, jest jednym z nich. Ma dwie supermoce, zdolność wyczuwania „nastrojów” lub emocji i ostry wzrok. Jeśli to brzmi znajomo, tak, to trochę jak to, co wydarzyło się w THE DARKEST MINDS, i podejrzewam, że to z powodu promieniowania ludzie tak ewoluowali, bo jakie jest inne wytłumaczenie? Autor z pewnością nie dał wglądu w to, jak ludzkość się rozeszła, ani dlaczego. Historia zaczyna się, gdy grupa nastolatków wychodzi, by szaleć, jak to nastolatki robią, a Aria ostatecznie bierze na siebie winę za syna przywódcy. Zostaje wyrzucona ze swojej grupy i pozostawiona na śmierć na pustyni. Tutaj poznaje Perry'ego, który już ją uratował przed śmiercią. Sposób, w jaki go traktuje, jest okropny i dopóki nagle nie decydują, że są zakochani, oboje zasadniczo nienawidzą się nawzajem. Aria uważa, że ​​jest okrutnym dzikusem, a Perry uważa, że ​​jest przesadnie uprzywilejowaną dupą, która jest zbyt głupia, by żyć. Muszę przyznać, że moja sympatia leży bardziej po stronie Perry'ego - szczególnie, gdy Aria rzuca się głową w sabat kanibali. Przeczytałam wiele dystopijnych powieści młodzieżowych i myślę, że UNDER THE NEVER SKY ma więcej wspólnego ze złymi niż dobrymi. THE DARKEST MINDS i SHATTER ME również przedstawiały głupie jak but bohaterki w dystopijnych/postapokaliptycznych światach, w których ludzie nagle rozwinęli supermoce bez wyraźnego powodu, a w obu tych książkach, jak i w tej, leniwe budowanie świata zepsuło mi historię, ponieważ mnóstwo luk w fabule nieustannie wyciągało mnie z opowieści i pytało: „DLACZEGO?”. Myślę też, że jeśli zamierzasz napisać powieść postapokaliptyczną, musisz odpowiedzieć na pytania jak i dlaczego świat został zniszczony. To wątpliwość, którą miałem co do THE RAGING ONES sióstr Ritchie, gdzie zarówno oś czasu wydarzenia wyzwalającego, jak i budowanie świata są równie niejasne. Możesz mieć powieści postapokaliptyczne, w których świat końcowy ma niewiele wspólnego z oryginałem. Myślę, że jednym z koronnych przykładów jest A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ, która jest opowiedziana w trzech częściach i przedstawia społeczeństwo odbudowujące się po nuklearnym holokauście, najpierw jako łowcy-zbieracze, potem jako społeczeństwo średniowieczne, a następnie, jeśli dobrze pamiętam, jako futurystyczne. Trylogia MaddAdam Margaret Atwood jest kolejnym przykładem, w którym manipulacje genetyczne i technologiczne zasadniczo spowodowały implozję społeczeństwa, wypaczając to, co naturalne, w to, co nienaturalne. Ale obie te książki, które nawiasem mówiąc mi się podobały, miały solidne odpowiedzi na pytania jak i dlaczego. UNDER THE NEVER SKY ma kilka interesujących pomysłów, ale nie udaje mu się ich właściwie zrealizować. Zbyt wiele rzeczy pozostało bez odpowiedzi, a historia nie różniła się tak naprawdę od innych naśladowców HUNGER GAMES, którzy chcieli stworzyć to samo dystopijne środowisko, nie dodając tej samej ilości stawek, budowania świata lub rozwoju postaci.

Thank you a lot! |Blurb:Mare Barrow’s blood is red—the color of common folk—but her Silver ability, the power to control lightning, has turned her into a weapon that the royal court tries to control.The crown calls her an impossibility, a fake, but as she makes her escape from Maven, the prince—the friend—who betrayed her, Mare uncovers something startling: she is not the only one of her kind.Pursued by Maven, now a vindictive king, Mare sets out to find and recruit other Red-and-Silver fighters to join in the struggle against her oppressors.But Mare finds herself on a deadly path, at risk of becoming exactly the kind of monster she is trying to defeat.After a few days where I was supposed to make peace with certain things that happened in this book, I’ve come with the following conclusion:I have no idea how the fuck I’m supposed to feel about this story and I’m this close to give up on the whole thing.I’m utterly disappointed in Aveyard, to be quite honest. She had a chance to redeem herself with this book and she just threw it away. There were only two things I liked about this story and I’ll talk about them later. Let me explain why this turned out a disaster for me.Alright, you may not remember but when I finished readingRed QueenI said I needed Mare to level up and start being a cunning girl. She has potential but when it comes to explore she either is afraid or messes it up.I could not stand her at all.She was lowHIGHkey in a never ending sorry fest that had me wanting to stab her for like 99% of the book. I just didn’t get her! WHY WAS SHE MOPPING ABOUT?Oh, poor Mare, she was fooled by Maven. Oh, poor little girl, she was hurt. Sweet innocent child can’t trust anyone…I had to put the book down more than 7 times just because of her and her effing whining attitude.Oh, when she tried to be “bad-ass”? Whining tough wannabe. Mare was such a great disappointment my brain cannot wrap about how stupid she was during the whole book. I’m speechless.Now, I’d like to say something nice about her but I did not find anything and I have no motivation to just go ahead and try to search for something decent to say. Nope, just no. It was plain stupid how she was pinning after Maven. She had to fucking move on but keeping those letters? Stupid ass decision.EVERYTHING ABOUT MARE WAS DUMB AND DISSAPOINTING.She was just a little girl trying to play the ruthless boss.If there was something I hated the same or even more than Mare dumb as fuck Barrow was those tag lines and nicknames.Oh my god, I could find the wordsLightning girl, the shadow of the flame, the exiled prince, anyone can betray anyone…like 10 times in one single page and it made me want to punch someone. I kid you not, it was so repetitive and plain stupid. Aveyard tried so hard to make those names and quotes to work but they were way too much. It did not work.I missed Evangeline. She was such a threat and she was fun to read. I actually missed ALL THE VILLAINS. While our, uhm, heroes were traveling and recruiting people, they were facing problems BUT none of Maven’s actions in this book were as bad as in book one. Same with the queen.Where did the evil masterminds go?And because we didn’t have thatfast-pacing-we’re-going-to-diekind of thing, we got plenty of time to read all about Mare’s breakdowns, yay.On that note, the queen was killed so fucking easily I totally missed it. Like???Was that it?It was not only ridiculous but such a disrespect to the image I had of the queen. I just can’t believe she was killed that easy, you know? I was waiting for her to get up and start making people kill each other on the plane but nope.And I was bored. Utterly bored during the whole book. Like I said, I put it down several times because I honestly didn’t want to continue reading it. I felt like it was going nowhere and I hated that feeling.So, what I actually LIKED? Cal.I wanted Aveyard to explore him and let us know him better and she did. Thank you. He’s quite great and he really does not deserve Mare whatsoever. He’s so much more sensitive and strong than I thought he was and absolutely clever. He’s got a really sweet heart and he’s just so good. He could’ve been an amazing king.If there was something done right in this book, that was Cal’s characterization. I fell for the guy big time and I truly hope he gets to be happy in the end.The other thing I liked about this mess was Cameron, Shade and the very end. Yep, all that in one single category because the more I think about the book, the more pissed I get.I think that Cameron was, not only a strong addition, but also someone who gave a new purpose to the plotline. She was on point with a lot of things that Mare, selfish stupid Mare, could not see.Shade *sigh* I did not see it coming and I’m not happy about it.Look, I’m more than okay with deaths, seriously BUT his dead only served to what…? So Mare could wake the fuck up and do some shit? That was… ugh, I have no words. I’m just pissed.I appreciated what Shade added to the story and he was just a good guy. So no. I’m not happy with what happened to him but at the same time I’m happy I got to know him a bit more.Was it me or Fayre whatever her name is acted weird? I mean, I’m not talking about Shade’s death but I got the feeling she was hiding something. Is she pregnant? Are all the newbloods dying or something? Not only I don’t know what was the answer to what the eye guy said to her but that fishy feeling is still there.The end was unexpected? I mean, I knew Mare was going to pull a Tris Prior but I guess I didn’t expect Maven to treat her like a dog. I liked that. If Mare is stupid enough to suffer for that piece of shit, then she well deserves what’s coming to her.I mean:“I’m not blind. I watched you take the notes off the bodies. I thought you’d rip them up. But when you didn’t—I suppose I wanted to see what you were going to do. Burn them, throw them away, send them back dipped in Silver blood—but not keep them. Not read them while I slept next to you.”“You said you missed him too. You said so,” I whisper. I have to refrain from stamping my foot like a frustrated child.“He’s my brother. I miss him in a very different way.”Mare, I just…Aveyard’s storytelling did not improve either and I did not know if I was reading a sci-fi, paranormal or fantasy novel. I think it’s an issue when an author doesn’t have a particular style that fits with the genre they’re writing so that was a disappointment as well.Will I read the last book? Yeah, probably. I’m curious to see how this mess of a story is going to continue but for now I just want to forget about this book., error: | ARC kindly provided by Orion Publishing Group via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

I was born to kill a king, to end a reign of terror before it can truly begin.”I do not know how to start this review. Seriously.That's why it's been pending for over a month.And after A LOT of thinking, I realized why:*drumroll*Nothing really happens.Yes, nothing happens in this book.The plot= non-existentWhen Mare discovers that she is not the only one of her kind- red and silver both, she sets off to find fellow 'Newbloods' like her.Yes, that's the plot.Throw in some random stuff like: rebellions, deaths, killings, action scenes and some romance to make it ~interesting~ but honestly this book felt like a filler.Because it is a filler.If I had to summarize the plot properly, here's what I would say-Mare Barrow, is the FaCe oF tHe ReBeLlIoN. As the blur says,'If there’s one thing Mare Barrow knows, it’s that she’s different'.She is SpEsHuL, as she is red and silver both.In the previous book, she was kept in the Palace and was engaged to a Sliver Prince Maven (which again, doesn't really make sense as to why a red was given power, so Mare should have seen the betrayal coming but she is stupid so, never mind) and is betrayed by Maven (who frankly is the only one with a brain here, except for Farley. We stan Farley.)Towards the end of the book, they escape and now Mare is on the lookout for more like her, also called the Newbloods so that they can fight and face the Silvers.The entire first half of the book is full of plot conveniences and predictable storylines.It comprises of- \"Oh no, we have a problem! But this Newblood has a random special power that can save the day. YAY!!!\"Yes, that's what happens throughout the first half book.*Insert*some random fights and yelling between Mare and Cal and Mare having a few breakdowns and thinking over Maven and Kilorn (who is her childhood best friend, and is iN lOvE with her)Fortunately, the book getsslightlybetter in the middle portion assomethingstarts happening, and the last 20 pages are probably the best part of the book. (they were actually good)But this book is 400+ pages, and when only the last 20 pages of a 400+ page book is the best part, itsnota good sign.The world building= even more non-existentThere is no world building.Period.I could stop there, but let me emphasize.From book 1 we are told that there are different cites (?) all over this world where the Red's are forced to work and etc. etc. but that's all we get about it.I want to know more about this world and it's history, and was disappointed with what I got.The writing“Red Queen. The lightning girl. She lives. Rise, Red as dawn. Rise. Rise. Rise.”The writing was alright, but it is a recurring of the common catchphrases; 'red like the dawn' and 'little lightning girl' and I personally found the action scenes repetitive.\"And I am revealed for exactly what I am - a particularly stupid fish, moving from hook to hook, never learning my lesson.\"This is a pretty good summary of the book.So I don't really have much to say on the writing. It was alright, but it could have been better.The charactersMare“If I am a sword, I am a sword made of glass, and I feel myself beginning to shatter.”Mare Barrow, our protagonist.I don't know what to say about her.She's having a hard time yes, but I won't excuse her behavior.She is arrogant and power hungry.The entire time Mare is mopping about how bad her life is.\"I suppose I should get used to being alone too. Not in the world, but in here. In my heart.\"“Mare of the Stilts died the day she fell onto a lightning shield. Mareena, the lost Silver princess, died in the Bowl of Bones. And I don’t know what new person opened her eyes on the Undertrain. I only know what she has been and what she has lost, and the weight of it is almost crushing.”She isnotcompassionate at all, even towards the people she killed herself.“It isn't hard to let people die when their deaths give life to something else.”I get it. Mare is having a bad life. Don't tell me that every other page.Mare is not a morally-grey character or an anti-hero.She is just a MC who doesn't have many good traits. And that makes her unlikable.I would have technically called Mare flawed, but after some thinking I realized she is justa special snowflakecharacter who can do anything.Really.\"Part of me wants to hold my ground, to stand, to fight. My purple-and-white lightening will certainly make me a target and draw the jets away from the fleeing Guard. I might even take a plane or two with me. But that cannot be. I'm worth more than the rest, more than red masks and bandages.\"Mare's lightning can doanythingpossible, and that makes it so plot convenient. She hardly ever gets injured, and even when she does she recovers far too quickly.I do admire her for her strength, but I didn't like Mare much as I felt things were far too easy for her.I get that she feels guilt, but I never felt sympathetic towards her.And that is Mare Barrow.Cal“Every single thing I did, you stood behind me,” I say. “If I’m turning into a monster, then so are you.” [Mare]I found Cal to beflat, boring and someone with hardly any personality.(Don't come at me!)I was fine with Cal in book 1, I had no emotions for him whatsoever. I was hoping book 2 will change that, but it didn't.I seriously think Mare and Cal are carbon cutouts of each other. There's hardly any difference between them.Let's do this;Mare is physically strong- Cal is physically strong.Mare can fight- Cal can fight.Mare misses Maven- Cal misses Maven.Mare is stubborn-Cal is stubborn.Mare wants revenge-Cal wants revenge.Mare is a Mary sue-Cal is a Gary sue.I hate Mare-I hate Cal.Need I go on?My point is that I don't like Mare or Cal, and that's unfortunate considering they are the main characters.Let's just hope they get better.“No matter how much I might want to feel him, I cannot. I must keep my eyes ahead, and away from the fire of a fallen prince. I must freeze my heart to the one person who insists on setting it ablaze.”ShadeShade is Mare's brother. I liked him a bit but he didn't really have much of a personality. Still, I liked him a bit.FarleyFarley is the best character in this series for me, second only to Maven.I absolutely love her.She is anactualstrong character, unlike Mare.She trusted Maven in book 1, but that was a rookie mistake. We're gonna ignore that.And she's pregnant! So excited for that.I felt bad for her when Shade died.Maven“Maven lies as easily as he breathes, and his mother holds his leash but not his heart.”Maven is possibly one of the best villain's I've read.“He leans forward slightly, lips pulling back against his even, white teeth. It’s so aggressive and animalistic I expect to see fangs. “I am your rightful king, Silver-born for centuries,” he replies, seething. “The only reason you’re still breathing is because I can’t burn the oxygen from this room.”I do expect him to have some sort of redemption arc, because it just seems like he will.“Yesterday he was a prince; today he is king. I thought he was my friend, my betrothed, but now I know better.”The romanceI do not care about Mare's love life.But if Ihadto make a choice, I ship her with Maven.I don't like Mare and Cal together as I personally don't see much chemistry between them. But they are both boring, so I suppose they deserve each other in that way.Why does mare have to end up with someone anyways? She's like 17.(But this is YA, so obviously that won't happen)Audiobook CommentsI think the narration was alright, but it was a bit slow for me. I can’t tell if it was because of the book, or the narration was generally slow but I think you might have to speed it up. I recommend the audiobook otherwise!Why did I rate it 2 stars?Despite its flaws, I enjoyed some parts of it (the ending) so its a 2 star from me.Final thoughtsIf you were a huge fan of book 1, then you might like this book. I think this is the kind you will either hate, or love.I would recommend it only if you are ok with everything I mentioned above in books. :)I amstillreading book 3 to see where it goes.

I was born to kill a king, to end a reign of terror before it can truly begin.”I do not know how to start this review. Seriously.That's why it's been pending for over a month.And after A LOT of thinking, I realized why:*drumroll*Nothing really happens.Yes, nothing happens in this book.The plot= non-existentWhen Mare discovers that she is not the only one of her kind- red and silver both, she sets off to find fellow 'Newbloods' like her.Yes, that's the plot.Throw in some random stuff like: rebellions, deaths, killings, action scenes and some romance to make it ~interesting~ but honestly this book felt like a filler.Because it is a filler.If I had to summarize the plot properly, here's what I would say-Mare Barrow, is the FaCe oF tHe ReBeLlIoN. As the blur says,'If there’s one thing Mare Barrow knows, it’s that she’s different'.She is SpEsHuL, as she is red and silver both.In the previous book, she was kept in the Palace and was engaged to a Sliver Prince Maven (which again, doesn't really make sense as to why a red was given power, so Mare should have seen the betrayal coming but she is stupid so, never mind) and is betrayed by Maven (who frankly is the only one with a brain here, except for Farley. We stan Farley.)Towards the end of the book, they escape and now Mare is on the lookout for more like her, also called the Newbloods so that they can fight and face the Silvers.The entire first half of the book is full of plot conveniences and predictable storylines.It comprises of- \"Oh no, we have a problem! But this Newblood has a random special power that can save the day. YAY!!!\"Yes, that's what happens throughout the first half book.*Insert*some random fights and yelling between Mare and Cal and Mare having a few breakdowns and thinking over Maven and Kilorn (who is her childhood best friend, and is iN lOvE with her)Fortunately, the book getsslightlybetter in the middle portion assomethingstarts happening, and the last 20 pages are probably the best part of the book. (they were actually good)But this book is 400+ pages, and when only the last 20 pages of a 400+ page book is the best part, itsnota good sign.The world building= even more non-existentThere is no world building.Period.I could stop there, but let me emphasize.From book 1 we are told that there are different cites (?) all over this world where the Red's are forced to work and etc. etc. but that's all we get about it.I want to know more about this world and it's history, and was disappointed with what I got.The writing“Red Queen. The lightning girl. She lives. Rise, Red as dawn. Rise. Rise. Rise.”The writing was alright, but it is a recurring of the common catchphrases; 'red like the dawn' and 'little lightning girl' and I personally found the action scenes repetitive.\"And I am revealed for exactly what I am - a particularly stupid fish, moving from hook to hook, never learning my lesson.\"This is a pretty good summary of the book.So I don't really have much to say on the writing. It was alright, but it could have been better.The charactersMare“If I am a sword, I am a sword made of glass, and I feel myself beginning to shatter.”Mare Barrow, our protagonist.I don't know what to say about her.She's having a hard time yes, but I won't excuse her behavior.She is arrogant and power hungry.The entire time Mare is mopping about how bad her life is.\"I suppose I should get used to being alone too. Not in the world, but in here. In my heart.\"“Mare of the Stilts died the day she fell onto a lightning shield. Mareena, the lost Silver princess, died in the Bowl of Bones. And I don’t know what new person opened her eyes on the Undertrain. I only know what she has been and what she has lost, and the weight of it is almost crushing.”She isnotcompassionate at all, even towards the people she killed herself.“It isn't hard to let people die when their deaths give life to something else.”I get it. Mare is having a bad life. Don't tell me that every other page.Mare is not a morally-grey character or an anti-hero.She is just a MC who doesn't have many good traits. And that makes her unlikable.I would have technically called Mare flawed, but after some thinking I realized she is justa special snowflakecharacter who can do anything.Really.\"Part of me wants to hold my ground, to stand, to fight. My purple-and-white lightening will certainly make me a target and draw the jets away from the fleeing Guard. I might even take a plane or two with me. But that cannot be. I'm worth more than the rest, more than red masks and bandages.\"Mare's lightning can doanythingpossible, and that makes it so plot convenient. She hardly ever gets injured, and even when she does she recovers far too quickly.I do admire her for her strength, but I didn't like Mare much as I felt things were far too easy for her.I get that she feels guilt, but I never felt sympathetic towards her.And that is Mare Barrow.Cal“Every single thing I did, you stood behind me,” I say. “If I’m turning into a monster, then so are you.” [Mare]I found Cal to beflat, boring and someone with hardly any personality.(Don't come at me!)I was fine with Cal in book 1, I had no emotions for him whatsoever. I was hoping book 2 will change that, but it didn't.I seriously think Mare and Cal are carbon cutouts of each other. There's hardly any difference between them.Let's do this;Mare is physically strong- Cal is physically strong.Mare can fight- Cal can fight.Mare misses Maven- Cal misses Maven.Mare is stubborn-Cal is stubborn.Mare wants revenge-Cal wants revenge.Mare is a Mary sue-Cal is a Gary sue.I hate Mare-I hate Cal.Need I go on?My point is that I don't like Mare or Cal, and that's unfortunate considering they are the main characters.Let's just hope they get better.“No matter how much I might want to feel him, I cannot. I must keep my eyes ahead, and away from the fire of a fallen prince. I must freeze my heart to the one person who insists on setting it ablaze.”ShadeShade is Mare's brother. I liked him a bit but he didn't really have much of a personality. Still, I liked him a bit.FarleyFarley is the best character in this series for me, second only to Maven.I absolutely love her.She is anactualstrong character, unlike Mare.She trusted Maven in book 1, but that was a rookie mistake. We're gonna ignore that.And she's pregnant! So excited for that.I felt bad for her when Shade died.Maven“Maven lies as easily as he breathes, and his mother holds his leash but not his heart.”Maven is possibly one of the best villain's I've read.“He leans forward slightly, lips pulling back against his even, white teeth. It’s so aggressive and animalistic I expect to see fangs. “I am your rightful king, Silver-born for centuries,” he replies, seething. “The only reason you’re still breathing is because I can’t burn the oxygen from this room.”I do expect him to have some sort of redemption arc, because it just seems like he will.“Yesterday he was a prince; today he is king. I thought he was my friend, my betrothed, but now I know better.”The romanceI do not care about Mare's love life.But if Ihadto make a choice, I ship her with Maven.I don't like Mare and Cal together as I personally don't see much chemistry between them. But they are both boring, so I suppose they deserve each other in that way.Why does mare have to end up with someone anyways? She's like 17.(But this is YA, so obviously that won't happen)Audiobook CommentsI think the narration was alright, but it was a bit slow for me. I can’t tell if it was because of the book, or the narration was generally slow but I think you might have to speed it up. I recommend the audiobook otherwise!Why did I rate it 2 stars?Despite its flaws, I enjoyed some parts of it (the ending) so its a 2 star from me.Final thoughtsIf you were a huge fan of book 1, then you might like this book. I think this is the kind you will either hate, or love.I would recommend it only if you are ok with everything I mentioned above in books. :)I amstillreading book 3 to see where it goes.

            "Translation failed for: Shhh, I'm taking some quiet time.Kidding! I'll be honest. I avoided this book the first time it appeared, when the buzz had it popping up all over. But my introversion has been more than a bit disrespected lately and I was feeling a need for some affirmation. Alas, I'm not sure I found much helpful here.Part One is 'The Extrovert Ideal,' and looks at how the change from the 18th century ideal of personality to 20th century cult of personality emphasized extroversion as a valuable workplace trait. I liked the concept of the two, as the cultural evolution from one to the other makes a great deal of sense, but I'm not sure how accurate that may be. I feel like Americans--and perhaps everyone--has always been responsive to extroverted, charismatic people. Actually, that highlights an error in Cain's thinking, that shefrequently conflates traits.To give her credit, she admits from the beginning that there is no uniform definition of 'introversion.' At page 11, she finally defines her terms, but she unfortunately tends to define them in terms of examples:\"Still, today's psychologist tend to agree on several important points: for example, that introverts and extroverts differ in the level of outside stimulation that they need to function well. Introverts feel 'just right' with less stimulation, as when they sip wine with a close friend, solve a crossword puzzle, or read a book. Extroverts enjoy the extra bang that comes from activities like meeting new people, skiing slippery slopes, and cranking up the stereo.... Many psychologists would also agree that introverts and extroverts work differently. Extroverts tend to tackle assignments quickly. They make fast (sometimes rash) decisions, and are comfortable multitasking and risk-taking... Introverts often work more slowly and deliberately. They like to focus on one task at a time and can have mighty powers of concentration. They're relatively immune to the lures of wealth and fame.\"It's some slippery stuff, because she ends up conflating a number of characteristics, and that's where it can get really fuzzy. This lack of specificity also means relying on anecdotes of how introversion is a helpful trait. Later in the book, she does bring in studies about 'reactivity,' a genetic-based trait that she prefers to call, 'sensitivity.' I've seen the term before, inThe Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the World Overwhelms You, and a lot of it comes from research on reactiveness/responsiveness to stimulation and how that is then interpreted. To be sure, it's interesting stuff, but it doesn't necessarily apply to all introverts, as she points out,\"about 70% of sensitive people are [introverts]\"(page 145).After backtracking to explain the evolutionary basis for selection of sensitivity, she then attempts to tie sensitivity and conscientiousness together. It's a thin, tenuous line to get from introverted to evolutionary sensitivity to conscientiousness and then imply that that's the kind of person you want in your company. As singular issues, each of these is well-presented. She usually cites one researcher and gives an example of a famous person who changed the world with this trait (Eleanor Roosevelt represented the introverted, sensitive and conscientious person). But it feels like both sloppy logic and false aggrandizement. As an introvert, I no more want to be 'special' for these qualities that presumably go with my genetic and personality tendencies than I want to be disrespected.For no particularly good reason, except the fact that it described me better than I've ever been described before, I'm actually a fan of the Jungian-based personality assessment. I think I particularly responded to the Jungian analysis because rather than the two-axis basis, there's other traits that also affect how we interact with the world. I actually think there's quite a continuum between introversion and extroversion, and that these tendencies can be modified by learning, as Cain rightly points out in Section Two.So, aboutQuiet.I don't think it really added anything to my understanding on introversion and extroversion. In fact, I think it fell into a more extroverted (as she would say) analysis of having to prove the worth of the trait and using famous figures to support her examples only added to that perception.Quiet didn't give me the acknowledgement I was looking for, really, just a lot of cheerleading that I'm (still) a good person for being an introvert. Hopefully, for those new to discovering their introversion, this might encourage them to both understand and respect their approach. Just don't look for many tips.Read this book if:1) You suspect/know you are an introvert but feel badly about it2) You are an extrovert who doesn't get why introverts don't just get out more.For a more rigorous analysis, check out Kelly's review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..., error: Ciii, robię sobie chwilę ciszy. Żartuję! Będę szczery. Unikałem tej książki, kiedy pojawiła się po raz pierwszy, kiedy szum wokół niej sprawił, że wyskoczyła wszędzie. Ale moja introwersja została ostatnio trochę zlekceważona i czułem potrzebę jakiegoś potwierdzenia. Niestety, nie jestem pewien, czy znalazłem tu wiele pomocnego. Część pierwsza to „Ideał ekstrawertyka” i przygląda się, jak zmiana z XVIII-wiecznego ideału osobowości na XX-wieczny kult osobowości podkreślała ekstrawersję jako cenną cechę w miejscu pracy. Podobał mi się koncept tych dwóch, ponieważ ewolucja kulturowa od jednego do drugiego ma wiele sensu, ale nie jestem pewien, czy jest to dokładne. Czuję, że Amerykanie — i być może wszyscy — zawsze byli wrażliwi na ekstrawertycznych, charyzmatycznych ludzi. Tak naprawdę, to podkreśla błąd w rozumowaniu Cain, która często myli cechy. Trzeba przyznać, że od początku przyznaje, że nie ma jednolitej definicji „introwersji”. Na stronie 11 w końcu definiuje swoje terminy, ale niestety ma tendencję do definiowania ich w kategoriach przykładów: „Mimo to współcześni psychologowie zgadzają się co do kilku ważnych punktów: na przykład, że introwertycy i ekstrawertycy różnią się poziomem zewnętrznej stymulacji, której potrzebują, aby dobrze funkcjonować. Introwertycy czują się „w sam raz” przy mniejszej stymulacji, na przykład gdy popijają wino z bliskim przyjacielem, rozwiązują krzyżówkę lub czytają książkę. Ekstrawertycy lubią dodatkowy efekt, który daje im poznawanie nowych ludzi, jazda na nartach po śliskich stokach i puszczanie głośnego radia... Wielu psychologów zgodziłoby się również, że introwertycy i ekstrawertycy pracują inaczej. Ekstrawertycy mają tendencję do szybkiego podejmowania zadań. Podejmują szybkie (czasem pochopne) decyzje i dobrze czują się, wykonując wiele zadań na raz i podejmując ryzyko... Introwertycy często pracują wolniej i rozważniej. Lubią skupiać się na jednym zadaniu na raz i mogą mieć potężne zdolności koncentracji. Są stosunkowo odporni na pokusy bogactwa i sławy”. To trochę niejasnych rzeczy, ponieważ kończy na łączeniu kilku cech, i to jest miejsce, w którym może się to naprawdę rozmyć. Ten brak konkretów oznacza również poleganie na anegdotach o tym, jak introwersja jest pomocną cechą. Później w książce przytacza badania na temat „reaktywności”, cechy opartej na genetyce, którą woli nazywać „wrażliwością”. Widziałem już ten termin wcześniej, w The Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the World Overwhelms You, i wiele z tego pochodzi z badań nad reaktywnością/odpowiedzią na stymulację i tym, jak jest ona następnie interpretowana. Oczywiście, to ciekawe rzeczy, ale niekoniecznie dotyczą wszystkich introwertyków, jak wskazuje, „około 70% wrażliwych osób to [introwertycy]” (strona 145). Po cofnięciu się, aby wyjaśnić ewolucyjne podstawy selekcji wrażliwości, próbuje następnie powiązać wrażliwość i sumienność. To cienka, krucha linia, by przejść od introwertyzmu do ewolucyjnej wrażliwości na sumienność, a następnie zasugerować, że to jest rodzaj osoby, którą chcesz mieć w swoim towarzystwie. Jako pojedyncze kwestie, każda z nich jest dobrze przedstawiona. Zazwyczaj cytuje jednego badacza i podaje przykład znanej osoby, która zmieniła świat tą cechą (Eleanor Roosevelt reprezentowała introwertyczną, wrażliwą i sumienną osobę). Ale wydaje się to zarówno niedbałą logiką, jak i fałszywym wywyższaniem. Jako introwertyk nie chcę być bardziej „specjalny” ze względu na te cechy, które prawdopodobnie idą z moimi genetycznymi i osobowościowymi tendencjami, niż chcę być lekceważony. Bez żadnego szczególnie dobrego powodu, poza faktem, że opisuje mnie lepiej, niż kiedykolwiek wcześniej zostałem opisany, jestem w rzeczywistości fanem oceny osobowości opartej na Jungu. Myślę, że szczególnie zareagowałem na analizę Jungowską, ponieważ zamiast dwuosiowej podstawy, istnieją inne cechy, które również wpływają na sposób, w jaki wchodzimy w interakcje ze światem. Właściwie myślę, że istnieje dość duże kontinuum między introwersją a ekstrawersją i że te tendencje można modyfikować poprzez naukę, jak Cain słusznie zauważa w rozdziale drugim. Więc o Quiet. Nie sądzę, żeby to naprawdę cokolwiek dodało do mojego zrozumienia introwersji i ekstrawersji. W rzeczywistości myślę, że wpadli w bardziej ekstrawertyczną (jak by powiedziała) analizę konieczności udowodnienia wartości cechy i używanie znanych postaci do poparcia swoich przykładów tylko wzmocniło to postrzeganie. Quiet nie dała mi uznania, którego szukałam, naprawdę, tylko dużo dopingowania, że ​​jestem (nadal) dobrą osobą, będąc introwertyczką. Mam nadzieję, że dla tych, którzy dopiero odkrywają swoją introwersję, może to zachęcić ich do zrozumienia i uszanowania ich podejścia. Po prostu nie szukaj zbyt wielu wskazówek. Przeczytaj tę książkę, jeśli: 1) Podejrzewasz/wiesz, że jesteś introwertykiem, ale źle się z tym czujesz 2) Jesteś ekstrawertykiem, który nie rozumie, dlaczego introwertycy po prostu nie wychodzą częściej.

            "Translation failed for: Sometimes you get to the final book in a series, and it feels like a different author is writing it, that therealauthor who began the story back at book one packed a suitcase and got a one-way ticket to some far-off place. This is how I feel aboutMonsters of Men, which is really the proverbial nail in theChaos Walkingtrilogy's coffin.I've read several glowing reviews for this book, and I admit I struggle to see many of the things those readers are seeing. While everyone's entitled to their own opinions—enjoyment is subjective—I believe readers are less likely to enjoy this trilogy when the books are read consecutively. I can see how waiting a year between books might result in one forgetting the little bits and pieces Ness inserted into his world, and so their absence might not be so frustrating and noticeable. I don't believe I'dlikethis book with such a wait between readings, but I suspect I wouldn't find the problems as glaring as I do now. When reading the books back to back, the numerous technical flaws with Ness' writing are impossible to ignore.By far, Ness' biggest problem inMonsters of Menis technique. It's strange to say that, considering I so love his technique inThe Knife of Never Letting Go, but there's a vast difference, and I would saydeclining quality, between the first and last books of this trilogy.Ness continues his sloppy perspective-switching fromThe Ask and the Answer—and it unfortunately gets worse. Whereas most of the perspective-switching in book two was between chapters, it's betweenscenesinMonsters of Men. One 400-word scene switches to another 400-word scene from a different perspective, then back again, and on and on. If not for POV headings, readers would struggle to keep up. (Although, the characters spend so much time screaming each other's names that you're never entirely lost. VIOLA! TODD! VIOLA! MARCIA, MARCIA, MARCIA!) Typographical differences are meant to exist between the different points of view, too, but I found this was a little inconsistent for me in the ebook format for Nook. In other words, if you're dying to read this, do so in print.There's eventually so much perspective switching that Todd and Viola not only don't sound like themselves from previous books, they halfway morph into some near-schizophrenic first person point of view. Either Todd has an educated, though immature, female alter ego or Viola's got an illiterate, redneck boy living inside her. Neither feels quite right. Worse yet, Ness adds inanotherfirst person perspective. It should be said thatnot everything needs to be known about everyone at all times in a book. If a writer thinks otherwise, to any degree, he or she should almost certainly be writing in third person, not first. This is basic stuff, and I'm dismayed Ness had no editor come to his rescue.It's difficult for me to look past technical issues to see positives in character development, but I think Ness fails to deliver on this front, too. For Todd and Viola, I can see where he attempts to show development, but it's lost in the perspective chaos (no pun intended) and the ever-conveniently-changing plot device that the Noise becomes.Character development is far worse with Mayor Prentiss,Chaos Walking's bad guy who's meant to disturb readers with his near-unending cruelty and unhinged understanding of the world. I waited and hoped for some deep revelation about Prentiss and his behavior, but he really only becomes an idiotic,grinningsideshow. I should have known not to expect much when the bookopenedwith this dialogue:\"War,\" says Mayor Prentiss, his eyes glinting.\"At last.\"Mistress Coyle is a better-written bad guy. She's all about control and power, and readers know enough about her history to know some of the reasonswhyshe behaves the way she does. But Mistress Coyle is not the bad guy readers were introduced to in book one, and though she's of a similar nature to Prentiss, she is the lesser of evils, whether Ness intended for her to be or not.Yeah, she chooses to be a suicide bomber to prove a point, but she didn't try to kill every woman on the planet, now, did she?That Mistress Coyle is a mildly interesting and believable bad guy doesn't really matter, though. Thewhole trilogyfalls flat and ultimately makes no sense if we don't understand Mayor Prentiss' history and motives. The previous war with the Spackle, thegenocideof women in Prentisstown and his subsequent rise to power there, the connection to Preacher Aaron's religious fundamentalism, the chasing of Todd \"for his innocence,\" the chasing of Viola, his overtaking of all settlements between Prentisstown and Haven, his continued hatred of Spackle and women, his love of war, his interest in Viola's people, his ability to control minds, and countless other things make no sense if readers aren't given details. He doesn't seem to care about fame or fortune—or even power,really—just mind games and war. Without more behind his behavior, he becomes a stock character, mere decoration for Ness' moral and political messages, and a placeholder for true conflict.I'm going to \"spoil\" the big \"secret\" about Mayor Prentiss for you: He's crazy and bad to the bone. That's it.That brings me back to Ness' philosophical messages against war and violence. An inadequate handling of Mayor Prentiss muddles the message Ness is trying to get out to young people. Prentiss is not a realistic portrayal of real-world evil, and so any pacifistic messages surrounding him crumble. Everything's made more awkward when Ness pulls out the oldNoble Savage tropefor the Spackle. They are glorified Native Americans, right down to their peace-seeking chieftain and his elaborate headpiece. Todd and Viola's response to the world they live in can't deliver important life lessons because their world no longer mirrors any sort of reality by the end of this book. All the good and evil has been created using cookie-cutter stereotypes.Other young adult authors have better communicated how difficult it is to understand and cope with the hows and whys of people's behavior, as well as how unclear appropriate courses of action can be. While Ness accomplishes some of the latter inMonsters of Menthrough Todd and Viola, he struggles to portray the former because of his poor development of Mayor Prentiss. If only the evil men of our world were more like Ness portrays Prentiss: void of political, moral, and financial motivations and connections. It wouldn't be so difficult to know how to respond to them.These are just some of the problems with this book. Questions are left unanswered, too many characters prove to be unimportant, and the ending can only be described as an anticlimactic showdown reminiscent of every bad superhero movie ever made.I still thinkThe Knife of Never Letting Gois a fun read, which is why I can't bring myself to give this book the one-star rating it may very well deserve, butThe Ask and the AnswerandMonsters of Menare disappointing followups. This trilogy had potential, but Ness ultimately doesn't deliver.========================================Quotes From the Book(Apply your own positive/negative connotations.)========================================That’s the nasty, nasty secret of war- When yer winning- When yer winning, it’s ruddy thrilling—---And then I turn to the Mayor and I’m filled with her, with her love for me and my love for her- And it makes me big as an effing mountain-, error: Sometimes you get to the final book in a series, and it feels like a different author is writing it, that therealauthor who began the story back at book one packed a suitcase and got a one-way ticket to some far-off place.

All the good and evil has been created using cookie-cutter stereotypes.Other young adult authors have better communicated how difficult it is to understand and cope with the hows and whys of people's behavior, as well as how unclear appropriate courses of action can be. While Ness accomplishes some of the latter inMonsters of Menthrough Todd and Viola, he struggles to portray the former because of his poor development of Mayor Prentiss. If only the evil men of our world were more like Ness portrays Prentiss: void of political, moral, and financial motivations and connections. It wouldn't be so difficult to know how to respond to them.These are just some of the problems with this book. Questions are left unanswered, too many characters prove to be unimportant, and the ending can only be described as an anticlimactic showdown reminiscent of every bad superhero movie ever made.I still thinkThe Knife of Never Letting Gois a fun read, which is why I can't bring myself to give this book the one-star rating it may very well deserve, butThe Ask and the AnswerandMonsters of Menare disappointing followups. This trilogy had potential, but Ness ultimately doesn't deliver.========================================Quotes From the Book(Apply your own positive/negative connotations.)========================================That’s the nasty, nasty secret of war- When yer winning- When yer winning, it’s ruddy thrilling—---And then I turn to the Mayor and I’m filled with her, with her love for me and my love for her- And it makes me big as an effing mountain- --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: Well, this was disappointing. Easily the worst so far. I postponed writing a review hoping some time and a re-read would somehow improve my opinion of the book. It didn’t.Part 1 was passable. Part 2 was watered by too many unnecessary PoVs. Part 3 was watered by too many sub-plots and not enough interaction between characters. Part 4 didn’t manage to pick up the pace. Part 5 tried to squish so many events it became chaotic.The plot takes over characters and they are like leafs in the storm. They just accept whatever for the purpose of moving the story forward because there was no time to be bothered or surprised. So much so that the author felt the need to at least include a sentence on how overwhelming everything is and people have no choice, but to carry on without wasting time to be relatable or fleshed out. Yeah, that should fix it… not.Adolin murdered Sadeas at the end of WoR, yet the consequences lead to a larger narrative arc with little personal development. None of the main cast cared. Adolin was missing in the second part, served as solely comic relief in the third. Kaladin also didn’t get a PoV in the second part; instead we have various Bridge Four narrators. Expansion of PoV characters is one of the things I dislike in this book. The world is large enough. We already have interludes. The constant inclusion of new viewpoints breaks the WoK promise of focus. Those new Kaladin flashbacks were unnecessary, we already have chapters upon chapters on Dalinar’s flashbacks, can Brandon not make a third of the book about the past, please? Especially when simultaneously trying to have thousand things happen in the present, too.Shallan continues her personality split, which initially didn’t bother me much, but I hoped we’d be done with that by the end of the book. Instead not even the Hoid dues ex machine could stop this painfully boring arch. Her fascination with Kaladin doesn’t get explored, but neither is it fully denied. However, he does acknowledge he never loved her, which should have been obvious; you don’t fall in love with someone just because you fell in a chasm with them. Plus she constantly insults him and shows no appreciation of his character. Why do people ship them again? Anyway, I’m glad there wasn’t a love triangle.Dalinar’s flashbacks were probably the most interesting set we got so far. Dalinar’s oath was once again unclear. What exactly happened? Why didn’t Dalinar ask that question? He didn’t know what Ascention is. He ignored this remark like he ignored all mentions of Adonalsium while simultaneously claiming to be looking for the real God and anything larger than Honor.Syl is this special Ancient Daughter and blah-blah. Like Ivory is basically a prince, Stormfather is sliver of Honor, Glys is half corrupted… Don’t tell me, is Wyndle Cultivation’s personal gardener?Lift was able to enter Dalinar’s visions and sneak up on Odium? Where’s the foreshadowing for that? Last book and in Edgedancer she had very little understanding of her powers. How about a little explanation? Or can she suddenly do this because it’s convenient for the plot? Like how Amaram conveniently became a superpowerful mutant Kaladin couldn’t win against?And the drastic change in the scope of Shallan's abilities - last book she could barely make her illusions move and they disappeared if she wasn't looking unless attached to Pattern. Now she can make them perform a play, create a whole army of them - no need to look or attach them to anything. She can also have a conversation with her illusions! How believable... At least she had the decency to be surprised.A dozen new PoVs and characters, yet not a sentence about Redin, the bastard son of the late king of Jah Keved, who rode with a considerable force somewhere? Yet another dropped sub-plot and unfulfilled expectation from last book.R.I.P all characters with the letter E, the author hates you all. Elhokar’s non-existent redemption arch with unsatisfying end was one of the worst. Now a woman and a heretic is king and I bet we won’t see the social outcry and pushback such a drastic change should have upon a nation, because the plot probably can’t spare time to deal with this like it couldn’t with a bunch of other arcs that were left midway.List of ‘overpromised and under delivered’:•Everstorm•Voidbringers•Unmade•People’s hatred for Radiants•Recreanse secretBut the crown of ‘most ridiculous’ goes to the Skybreakers – the only Knight Radiant Order to have kept their oaths for millennia only to join the enemy they have been fighting since times immemorial. Wow. As if the secret that caused Recreanse should be a secret to them. They learned this over a thousand years ago for fucks sake. They should have told Nale centuries ago and I’m already extremely skeptical to the notion this is news to a Herald… This is either bad writing or an insult to the readers’ intelligence as there should be something else. If there isn’t, this a plot hole larger the hole that sank Titanic., error: Cóż, to było rozczarowujące. Zdecydowanie najgorsze jak dotąd. Odłożyłem napisanie recenzji, mając nadzieję, że trochę czasu i ponowne przeczytanie jakoś poprawią moją opinię o książce. Tak się nie stało. Część 1 była do przyjęcia. Część 2 była podlewana zbyt wieloma niepotrzebnymi punktami widzenia. Część 3 była podlewana zbyt wieloma wątkami pobocznymi i zbyt małą interakcją między postaciami. Część 4 nie zdołała nabrać tempa. Część 5 próbowała stłumić tak wiele wydarzeń, że zrobiło się chaotycznie. Fabuła przejmuje postacie i są jak liście w burzy. Po prostu akceptują wszystko, aby popchnąć historię do przodu, ponieważ nie ma czasu, aby się tym przejmować lub być zaskoczonym. Do tego stopnia, że ​​autor poczuł potrzebę, aby przynajmniej zamieścić zdanie o tym, jak przytłaczające jest wszystko i ludzie nie mają wyboru, jak tylko kontynuować bez marnowania czasu, aby być wiarygodnymi lub rozwiniętymi. Tak, to powinno to naprawić… nie. Adolin zamordował Sadeasa pod koniec WoR, ale konsekwencje prowadzą do większego łuku narracyjnego z niewielkim rozwojem osobistym. Nikt z głównej obsady nie przejął się tym. Adolina brakowało w drugiej części, pełnił jedynie funkcję komiczną w trzeciej. Kaladin również nie miał punktu widzenia w drugiej części; zamiast tego mamy różnych narratorów Bridge Four. Rozszerzenie punktów widzenia postaci jest jedną z rzeczy, których nie lubię w tej książce. Świat jest wystarczająco duży. Mamy już interludia. Ciągłe włączanie nowych punktów widzenia łamie obietnicę skupienia WoK. Te nowe retrospekcje Kaladina były niepotrzebne, mamy już rozdziały po rozdziałach o retrospekcjach Dalinara, czy Brandon nie mógłby zrobić jednej trzeciej książki o przeszłości, proszę? Zwłaszcza, gdy jednocześnie próbuje sprawić, by tysiące rzeczy wydarzyło się również w teraźniejszości. Shallan kontynuuje rozdwojenie swojej osobowości, co początkowo nie przeszkadzało mi zbytnio, ale miałem nadzieję, że skończymy z tym do końca książki. Zamiast tego nawet Hoid dues ex machine nie mógł powstrzymać tego boleśnie nudnego łuku. Jej fascynacja Kaladinem nie jest eksplorowana, ale też nie jest całkowicie zaprzeczana. Jednak przyznaje, że nigdy jej nie kochał, co powinno być oczywiste; nie zakochujesz się w kimś tylko dlatego, że wpadłeś w przepaść. Poza tym ona ciągle go obraża i nie docenia jego charakteru. Dlaczego ludzie znowu ich shipują? Tak czy inaczej, cieszę się, że nie było trójkąta miłosnego. Retrospekcje Dalinara były prawdopodobnie najciekawszym zestawem, jaki dostaliśmy do tej pory. Przysięga Dalinara była po raz kolejny niejasna. Co dokładnie się stało? Dlaczego Dalinar nie zadał tego pytania? Nie wiedział, czym jest Ascention. Zignorował tę uwagę, tak jak zignorował wszystkie wzmianki o Adonalsium, jednocześnie twierdząc, że szuka prawdziwego Boga i wszystkiego, co większe niż Honor. Syl jest tą wyjątkową Starożytną Córką i blah-blah. Tak jak Ivory jest zasadniczo księciem, Stormfather jest odrobiną Honoru, Glys jest w połowie zepsuta... Nie mów mi, czy Wyndle Cultivation jest osobistym ogrodnikiem? Lift był w stanie wejść w wizje Dalinara i zakraść się na Odium? Gdzie jest zapowiedź tego? W poprzedniej książce i w Edgedancer miała bardzo małe pojęcie o swoich mocach. Co powiecie na małe wyjaśnienie? A może nagle zrobi to, ponieważ jest to wygodne dla fabuły? Tak jak Amaram wygodnie stał się superpotężnym mutantem, z którym Kaladin nie mógł wygrać? I drastyczna zmiana w zakresie zdolności Shallan - w poprzedniej książce ledwo mogła poruszać swoimi iluzjami, a one znikały, jeśli nie patrzyła, chyba że były przywiązane do Wzorca. Teraz może sprawić, że odegrają sztukę, stworzyć całą ich armię - nie trzeba ich patrzeć ani przywiązywać do niczego. Może też rozmawiać ze swoimi iluzjami! Jak wiarygodnie... Przynajmniej miała na tyle przyzwoitości, żeby być zaskoczoną. Tuzin nowych punktów widzenia i postaci, ale ani jednego zdania o Redinie, nieślubnym synu zmarłego króla Jah Keved, który gdzieś jechał ze znaczną siłą? Kolejna porzucona podfabuła i niespełnione oczekiwania z poprzedniej książki. Spoczywajcie w pokoju, wszystkie postacie z literą E, autor was wszystkich nienawidzi. Nieistniejący łuk odkupienia Elhokara z niezadowalającym zakończeniem był jednym z najgorszych. Teraz kobieta i heretyk jest królem i zakładam się, że nie zobaczymy społecznego oburzenia i oporu, jaki tak drastyczna zmiana powinna mieć na naród, ponieważ fabuła prawdopodobnie nie może poświęcić czasu na poradzenie sobie z tym, jak nie mogła z wieloma innymi łukami, które zostały porzucone w połowie. Lista „zbyt obiecanych i nie dostarczonych”:•Everstorm•Voidbringers•Unmade•Nienawiść ludzi do Radiantów•Sekret RecreanseAle korona „najbardziej absurdalnych” trafia do Skybreakers – jedynego Rycerza Zakonu Radiantów, który dotrzymał przysięgi przez tysiąclecia, tylko po to, aby dołączyć do wroga, z którym walczył od niepamiętnych czasów. Wow. Jakby sekret, który spowodował Recreanse, miał być dla nich sekretem. Dowiedzieli się tego ponad tysiąc lat temu, na litość boską. Powinni byli powiedzieć Nale'owi wieki temu, a ja jestem już bardzo sceptyczny co do idei, że to nowina dla Heralda… To albo złe pisanie, albo obraza inteligencji czytelników, ponieważ powinno być coś innego. Jeśli nie ma, to jest to luka w fabule większa od tej, która zatopiła Titanica. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: If there's one thing that makes my blood boil and my skin ripple with creepy crawlies, it's a story that disrespects real suffering. For me, this was one of those. Even though it started off really well, the second half majorly crashed and burned. Think there are two stories of suffering in this series: the teen-angst romance and the story of genocide and grief. This was such a huge fail for me in the way the grief story becomes an afterthought so the teen-angst romance can get back in the spotlight. This story is about how attraction to a hot guy molds a girl and changes her fibers, defines (in some undefinable way) who she is, and grief is something that, while uncomfortable, passes like a bruise. I think the opposite is true.Murder and the Manic PixieI googled \"genocide statistics,\" and these are the numbers the internet came up with for me:Armenia: 1,000,000 killed from 1915-1923China under Mao: 58,000,000 killedUSSR under Stalin: 20,000,000 killed (Robert Conquest, The Great Terror)Holocaust: 5,700,000 killed from 1933-1945 (Nuremberg Trial)Khmer Rouge (Cambodia): 1,600,000 killed between 1975-1978Bosnia: 250,000 killed from 1992-1995 (U.S. State Dept.)Rwanda: 1,000,000 killed in 1994Somalia: 300,000 killed from 1991-present (IRIN, a UN agency)Darfur: at least 450,000 killed from 2003-present (UN High Commission on Refugees)(http://www.urbanministry.org/wiki/gen...)It is kind of interesting that when we talk about war and genocide, we round the numbers so cleanly. We shove individuals off the statistics because one million makes a catchier number than 999,876. Or, maybe, we just estimate because it's not possible to evenknowhow many people died. It is certainly not possible to estimate how many survivors have been broken by genocide, not to mention the lives broken by racism and sexism, the slightly more chill siblings of genocide.Chris Hondros,Samar Hassan, 5, screams after her parents were killed in Tal Afar, IraqI understand why Stalin’s regime romanticized and justified genocide, and the same with Pol Pot, Hitler, and Mao. Propaganda is useful when you are clinging to maniacal power. And asEddie Izzard says,We think if someone kills someone, you go to prison, that’s murder. You kill ten people, you go to Texas, they hit you with a brick – that’s what they do. Twenty people, you go to a hospital, they look at you though a small window forever. And, over that, we can’t deal with it. Someone who’s killed a hundred thousand people . . . we’re almost going, ‘Well done! You killed a hundred thousand people? You must get up very early in the morning! I can’t even get down to the gym.’About this book, though . . . we see a lot of genocide in the world . . . and it seems disrespectful to me to romanticize a genocidal warlord, whether it is for the purposes of propaganda or for the purposes of a YA fantasy novel. Pushing Akiva’s choices onto the Emperor, or whatever he was called, just doesn’t ring true to me. You kill the people you kill, even if someone else told you to. And I’m not saying that books for a younger audience can’t talk about genocide. TheGregor the Overlanderseries blew me away when it went into genocide. Truly amazing. This book, though, was a whole book full of manic pixie dream girls dabbling in genocide and then gazing at each other.Even the dudes in this book are manic pixie dream girls. And it’s like, you know: genocide just gets so monotonous and tiring after a while. Genocide ennui is sonow. You kill and kill, and at first it’s fulfilling, but then you’re like, “this really isn’t getting me laid the way I thought it would, even though I got these eyes of fire and a dreamy widow’s peak and, like, shawls fulla moth-birds I picked up at Hot Topic.”Then, you gaze across a crowded battlefield at this girl, and she’s all, “OMG, all I want is hugs! And I know youkilled my whole family, but I’m pretty sure it was just because you loved me sooooo much!”And then her wise, exotic nanny is all, “Honey chile, you just gotsa go get yo man! He onlykillin’ ev’yone you loved‘cause he’sa grievin’ fo you. If you go back to him, maybe it will bring peace ta tha whole wide universe and tha moons’n stars.”Really? . . . Really?! It kind of highlights how convenient the resurrection convention of this series is. It’s okay that he’s a mass-murdering fuckhead! We’ll just bring the people we cared about back to life, and no harm done!Romeo and JulietPartway through this book, Karou somewhat heavy-handedly reminds us thatDaughter of Smoke and Bonewas the story ofRomeo and Juliet+ genocide, which, duh. Thanks, Karou. I, um, read it.Now, I loveRomeo and Juliet. I love it a lot. When I was in college, my genius roommate used to convince guys hanging out at our house to perform the balcony scene with her as a comedy. The play makes this wonderful, sad-clown comedy. Juliet is a crazy person, wanting to pluck Romeo back to herself like a little bird on a string, bwuhaha. Romeo is a self-centered ass, in love with the idea of being in love and bragging about his girlfriends to his buddies. It is kind of hilarious, especially set to the backdrop of the plague breakout in Verona, which gives some perspective to the childish dramatics of our couple.I have also seen one completely earnest, sad, beautiful production ofRomeo and Juliet. The actors playing the couple were living together in real life, and they had this palpable spark between them that made the star-crossed fate truly tragic. The lighting was intimate, like the production inSlings and Arrowsonce it turns beautiful (here at 2:50) and the couple was still dumb and cursed, but I may have teared up a couple of times because they were beautiful and hopeful.Daughter of Smoke and Bonecaught elements of both comedic and tragic readings ofRomeo and Julietperfectly. The real tragedy in either reading is that the story of these lovers can only exist within this window of time. It can only exist with the suicide at the end. Like any romantic story, it only works if the sun sets at the appropriate time. Otherwise, you start to realize that he snores, and she chews too loud. He says all his sentences as a question; she can’teverremember to put the cap back on her toothpaste.Or, worse than snoring, as Taylor so beautifully showed inDaughter of Smoke and Bone, he has the capacity in him to commit genocide and kill every one you ever loved. It is beautiful because that changes the entire game; it changes the entire person he is. He isnotthe person dreaming of peace and respect for all creatures. He is the person killing them.“Or is he?”Days of Blood and Starlightasks in its backwards bulldozing over the beauty of the first book. Maybe he was super provoked and it was okay that he killed and betrayed everyone because he was like, really, really sad. Awww. Poor little mass murdering fuckhead. He was so sad!Romance and GriefSo, the thing that bothers me in the fallout in this book is Karou. This story assumes Karou's devotion to this dude, into whose eyes she's gazed for like twelve seconds, would be a strong enough feeling to overcome her grief for her family.It creeps me out when women in real life blindly stay with men who make them feel terrible. It says something to me about the degradation of the soul. I think that plenty of smart and interesting women do that, but it is at its base a creepy choice to me. But, then, nothing in this story built up to Karou for that type of creepy choice, so her actions and feelings for Akiva just made no sense to me. There was this idea that it could be noble to go back to someone who made you feel the worst you could possibly feel. It’s not romantic, but it’s also confusing.It also makes no sense to me because romantic feelings (especially early, fiery romance) are like a delicate collectible unicorn figurine, and grief is like a jackhammer. Sometimes romantic feelings can’t survive someone’s table manners and overuse of the word “absolutely,” and it is beyond me to conceive of a situation, aside from being creepily insane sufferer of Stockholm syndrome, where romantic feelings could survive the murder of one’s whole family.Other Miscellaneous ComplaintsAm I wrong, or did all the hand-burning on the doors stuff happen when Karou was seventeen? But, I know Brimstone made her a baby because she has memories of her childhood, and it’s never indicated that they are false. So, like, this book is trying to tell me that Akiva was the nicest guy ever, and dreaming of peace, but then he did all of the hand-burning stuff in reaction to seeing Madrigal get killed? But, he just waited seventeen years to express his heat of passion genocide? That makes no sense.Also, if the hamsas work after you cut off a hand – so they have some kind of magic of their own aside from the soul inside of the body – why didn’t they just burn hamsas into the outside of the walls of Loramendi? Further, how did the whole group of angel soldiers stand around holding the hamsa hands without also accidentally hitting each other with hamsa magic? Dumb.And why be such an asshole to Ziri, book? Why be such an asshole to the ONLY actually badass character in this entire story? WHYYYY????In ConclusionOverall, I often don't agree with that advice to writers (I think from Faulkner) to \"kill your darlings,\" and I feel like writers often misapply it because they have something to prove. But, in the first book, Taylor so boldly worse-than-killed Akiva by revealing him to be a mass murdering fuckhead. Trying to resurrect his character by romanticizing what he did felt cheap and disrespectful in this one. Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot, like Akiva, all had motivations for their mass murdering, but they were not romantic motivations. It is not romantic to commit genocide or kill your girlfriend’s family. It is not romantic to make another person feel terrible. It’s not romantic to want to make out with a guy who killed your family. It just isn’t.______________________________I got a copy of this book from a friend, and nobody paid me anything to rip it to shreds with the crescent blades of my keyboard., error: If there's one thing that makes my blood boil and my skin ripple with creepy crawlies, it's a story that disrespects real suffering.

It is not romantic to make another person feel terrible. It’s not romantic to want to make out with a guy who killed your family. It just isn’t.______________________________I got a copy of this book from a friend, and nobody paid me anything to rip it to shreds with the crescent blades of my keyboard. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: “For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother…”-\tWilliam Shakespeare,Henry V, Act 4, Scene 3As a history lover, and as someone who loves not getting flamed on Goodreads, I am loathe to say what I am about to say. However, as someone who finds it impossible not to say what I feel like saying, I’ll just go ahead and say it: I don’t like Stephen Ambrose.Not likethat, I hasten to add.I didn’t know him personally, but in interviews he seemed like a nice man, congenial and friendly, who often charmingly mentioned his family in his books. Moreover, Ambrose did history itself an incredible service by collecting the stories of ordinary men. The living memory of World War II is fading fast, and it is due to the efforts of historians, biographers, and researchers like Stephen Ambrose that we will have so many incredible stories, even after that generation has passed into memory.But here’s the thing: I think he’s a crap writer.I’ve tried very hard in the past to enjoy Ambrose books. When I read the flaccidPegasus Bridge– my first experience – I told myself thatIwas at fault, not the great Ambrose.Then, I readCrazy Horse and Custerand noticed that entire pages were copied almost verbatim from Royal Hassrick’sThe Sioux. Still, I gave him a pass, knowing that sometimes writers make mistakes when it comes to citing sources.But the accusations of plagiarism kept cropping up, along with the Eisenhower Presidential Library accusing him of fabricating interviews with Ike.It occurred to me that – despite Ambrose’s pervasive popularity as the Godfather of Dad Books – my inclinations were correct. There are plenty of good author/historians in the world, free of taint, and I decided that I should avoid Ambrose in the future. Time is short, after all, and the library is large.But I got pulled back in.It’s the fault of HBO, truly and absolutely. The Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg-producedBand of Brothersminiseries happens to be one of the greatest things to ever appear on a screen. This is not hyperbole, by the way, but an objective fact written in the stars.When it first came out, I ordered HBO simply to watch it. I bought the DVD the first day it was available, and watched it start to finish again. Even though I owned the DVD, I watched in on the History Channel, every (edited) episode. When it came out on Spike TV (back when Spike TV existed), I sat through it again, through the interminable commercials of basic cable.I spent one enjoyable Thanksgiving watching it on the couch, a sated smile on my face. In college, I devoted a second date to watching an episode in my dorm room (there was no third date, but who needed dates when I had Ron Livingston and Donnie Wahlberg saving the world). WhenBand of Brotherswas released as a Blu-Ray set, I bought that too, and watched it yet again, reveling in the high-definition clarity that – unfortunately – really demonstrated the fakeness of the Bastogne sets.In short, I spent a not-insignificant portion of my pre-marriage, pre-kids life watchingBand of Brothers.Finally, after the 20th viewing, as an inevitability, I decided to read the source material:Band of Brothersby Stephen Ambrose. It had become an obligation.Band of Brothersis a grunt’s eye view of history. War as it was seen by the men who fought it. It stands on a continuum of anecdotal works by such luminaries as Walter Lord (Day of Infamy;Incredible Victory) and Cornelius Ryan (The Longest Day;A Bridge Too Far) who used a pastiche of eyewitness accounts to present the intimate side of a massive, impersonal war.Ambrose attempts to replicate, on a smaller scale, the feats of Lord and Ryan. In Easy Company of the 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne, he has an incredible subject: an elite group of soldiers who – like the mythical platoon of Samuel Fuller’sThe Big Red One– find themselves in just about every important operation in the European Theater, from D-Day to VE-Day.The problem, though, is that Ambrose is no Walter Lord, and he’s no Cornelius Ryan. He’s barely serviceable. His prose is blunt, ugly, and disjointed. There is tortured grammar and a noticeable lack of editing. There is not a smidgeon of grace or elegance to be found. Ambrose’s shortcomings as a writer are put in stark relief whenever he quotes from the writings of David Webster, a Harvard-educated English major who was part of Easy Company. Webster, unlike Ambrose, writes in vivid prose that is alive with acute perception.Most of the enjoyment I received from readingBand of Brotherscame from the fact that I’d seen the miniseries (more times than is healthy, probably) and was interested to compare and contrast the various characters. When I tried to imagine being a reader who hadn’t seen the miniseries, I found it hard to understand the universal acclaim.First, there is absolutely no tension or drama in the story. Instead of taking oral histories and spinning them into a narrative, Ambrose elects to directly quote the men he has interviewed. Now, I’m sure this saved him a great deal of time when it came to actually writing, but it tells you right away who lives, and to a lesser extent, who dies. If you like vividness, the sensation of being there – look elsewhere. This is the cutting and pasting of transcribed interviews.Ambrose’s style also feeds into a participant’s bias, in that the men who talked to Ambrose are lifted to the heights of Achilles or Hector, while those who did not participate, or who died, recede – for the most part – into the background. This is not history as it happened, but history as told by some limited viewpoints. (And this limited viewpoint is why Ambrose is criticized so often – by other veterans – for utterly screwing up the facts. He only listens to one side and seldom takes the time to corroborate).Another problem I had was Ambrose’s lack of objectivity when it comes to his subjects. And by lack of objectivity, I mean abject hero-worship. Here, once again, lest I be digitally mobbed, I wish to interject that yes, the men of Easy Company were heroic. They were young men who sacrificed their youths to do a dangerous job that their country asked them to do. There is a place for a flag-waving, chest-thumping, drum-beating homage to “the greatest generation.” Indeed, God created Tom Brokaw for just this purpose.However, it’s not a historian’s place to wave the flag or thump his chest or beat his drum. And Ambrose has always claimed to be a historian. InBand of Brothers, he is not. Instead, he’s more like a cheerleader, or a proud father, or a guy who secretly feels guilty that he never joined the army and fought a war. He is hyperbolic in his descriptions of Easy Company’s exploits, he is quick to take sides and defend his interview subjects at the expense of men who weren’t interviewed, and he gives a wink-wink nudge-nudge to myriad war crimes committed by those soldiers, including numerous executions of P.O.W.s, the murder of an alleged SS officer after the war was over, and enough looting and pillaging to make Genghis Khan envious.(These are war crimes, aren’t they? Or am I being obtuse? I mean, if the Germans had done this to us – killed our prisoners, as they did at Malmedy, or looted homes and businesses, as they did all over Europe, wouldn’t we consider them crimes? Didn’t we? Did we not try and execute or imprison Germans for these very things? The answer to those rhetorical questions – to be clear – isyes).Ambrose’s blinders leads him to continually make silly and unsupportable statements about how “citizen soldiers” and “democratic soldiers” were eminently superior to the Nazis forces of totalitarianism and darkness. This is a sweeping, simplistic, reductive, and jingoistic statement that is better placed on a 1940s war bonds poster.It’s also patently untrue. Far from being an inferior fighting force, the German armies were far better, man-for-man, than any other army in the world. By 1944, when Easy Company finally got in the war, the Wehrmacht had been fighting for five years. They’d destroyed Poland and France, nearly crushed England, and pushed Russia to the brink. After all those years and all those casualties, they still managed to scrape together one hell of a defense after Normandy. By the way, I hate the Nazis and everything they stood for. I’m just saying they could rumble.Ambrose’s failure is in using an exception to prove a rule. On the whole, the American armies in North Africa, Italy, and Europe didn’t perform especially well. This isn’t some kind of indictment on our fighting men, only a reality that comes from a mass draft, a hurried mobilization, and an army of citizens, not soldiers.Easy Company was an exception. They were an elite group. They were volunteers. They were well trained (again, so well trained that they didn’t actually get into the war till 1944; meanwhile, their fellow Americans invaded North Africa and Guadalcanal in 1942). The men of Easy Company were fit, mobile, ambitious, motivated, well-armed, strongly conditioned killers. They deserve their accolades. They are not, however, representative.The consequence of Ambrose’s tight focus on Easy Company, and his ill-conceived extrapolation of their experience, makesBand of Brothersinto something rare: a pro-war book. This is the anti-All Quiet on the Western Front. Rather than ruining lives and shattering psyches, Ambrose presents a portrait of war as a great adventure, and men who only became fully actualized by combat. It’s almost an advertisement: Go to War; Make Great Friends; See the World and Steal Some Nazi Silverware! To bolster this fact, Ambrose’s afterward stresses how many of Easy Company’s men became rich!That is what I took from Ambrose’s writing.Of course, that’s not the reality. Thanks to the miniseries and the accompanying documentary, you can actually listen to these men talk about their experiences. They don’t sound like the soldiers Ambrose presents in his book. They are somber and reflective. Their eyes glisten and their voices crack and waver. They hint at reservoirs of jumbled memories that combine the fear of battle and the horror of death and the pain of lost friends with the love of their brothers.

            "Translation failed for: Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestYou know when you're ordering a really strong drink from a bar, and it's got a lot more alcohol in it than you thought, to the point that you can almost taste the hangover over the rum and artificial fruit, and you think to yourself, \"This is a bad idea\" but then drink it anyway, and order another because YOLO? That's me every time I pick up a new adult book. I tell myself, \"Nenia, you're going to regret this, don't do it, you're not going to like it.\"But trashy erotica novels, like booze, are easy to do to excess.This is my second book by Penelope Douglas. The first I've read from her was CORRUPT, and that was lent to me by a kind GR friend via Kindle. I thought CORRUPT was okay, with reservations. I don't normally go in for erotica, especially erotica that reads like straight-up porn. All the men in that book were misogynistic and rapey, too, which added another level of nope. But the plot was decent and she was good at setting a decent pace, so I sort of half-enjoyed, half-wtf'd my way through the thing and at the end of the book, I wasn't mad. It was a flawed but decent read.PUNK 57 I bought myself, which already means that I'm going to be an eensy bit more critical of it because I'm spending my hard-earned money on the book and judging it accordingly. PUNK 57 was our book of the month in the Unapologetic Romance Readers group for April, and as someone who had read her work previously, I was interested in seeing how it had changed from CORRUPT.***WARNING: SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT***PUNK 57 is about two characters, Misha and Ryen, who are both in high school. They are also pen pals, although they have never met face to face before. Misha is punk and in a band and has piercings. Ryen is a cheerleader and preppy and into things like TWILIGHT and HARRY POTTER. After a tragedy happens in his life, Misha ends up going to Ryen's school under the name Masen for reasons that don't actually have anything to do with Ryen. When he realizes that she's not what he built her up to be on his imaginary pedestal, he gets angry and embarks on a mission to make her life hell. This, I actually didn't mind so much. It reminded me ofHana Yori Dango. A-hole heroes are actually a weakness of mine provided that a) the heroine reacts to this behavior accordingly and b) it takes a heck of a lot of groveling before the characters finally end up together.This does not happen in PUNK 57. Ryen is attracted to this mean behavior, despite herself, and the two of them have several sex scenes that have this really uncomfortable element that was also present in CORRUPT that is neither healthy nor entirely consensual (at least, that's how it felt tome). And it wasn't the fact that it wasn't 100% consensual at times that bothered me so much as the fact that Ryen seemed to be embracing this behavior as natural and something she needed. Example: at one point Misha/Masen breaks into her housewhile she's sleepingand catches her in bed naked. He assumes, naturally, that any woman who is naked must be entertaining male company, and makes an effort of looking around for that Other Man. When he realizes that she was actually masturbating, he asks her if she was thinking of him. Me, I'd be on the phone with the cops well before that point, but she lets him watch. Ew. He's also constantly getting physical with her and making her feel bad about herself, whether it's berating her for being fake or criticizing her clothes for being too sexy - because how dare she bring male attention upon herself. Like it's her fault for them looking or some BS. In keeping with this \"me man, woman mine\" caveman attitude, the sex is always big man alpha sex, of the cervix-slamming variety (you know the kind I mean) and I know some people enjoy this, and that's fine, but that isn't my cup of tea at all. I rolled my eyes a lot. Especially when they try anal - without lube - and all she feels is a tiny burn. Ha! Woman must have Superman's butthole if he can go in dry and not cause her any pain, that's all I'm going to say.I will say that the twist at the end with Misha's mom took me off-guard. I wasn't expecting that, although in hindsight it explains a lot. Like I said before, with CORRUPT, plotting isn't a weakness of Ms. Douglas's. But the confrontation and the way it was carried out left a similarly bad taste in my mouth, because it was a perfect mirror of his behavior towards Ryen and how it was actually pretty abusive. Misha is one of those guys who expects women to behave in certain ways, and if they violate that way at all, they are automatically bad. Ryen failed to live up to his sweet nerdy girl fantasy, so she becomes the whore in his eyes. Misha's mom couldn't take motherhood, so she becomes the horrible bitch who is responsible for all the problems in his life. It's the Madonna/whore complex, and Ihatethe Madonna/whore complex. Also, I'm realizing that I kind of hate Misha. I didn't want him to have an HEA with the heroine, because in my opinion, he never redeemed himself. He played the \"Baby, I'm damaged\" card and she completely bought it, final sale.Two things I did like (so this review ends on a positive note): I like how the author incorporates music into her stories. That was something I liked about CORRUPT as well, especially since her taste in music is pretty similar to mine. I also liked how she had characters from CORRUPT cameo in PUNK 57, even if it was the creeps. Am I surprised that Misha knows/is friends with those creeps? No. He's a creep, too. Creeps of a feather flock together. (No, bad Nenia - stay positive!)I didn't hate this book. I was afraid I would, but I didn't. Bar a few typos, it was fairly well written and had an interesting story. As much as I gripe, I must admit that I wasn't bored while reading it. It also has a Colleen Hoover-esque title whose meaning becomes clear at some point in the story, which is cool. Like Colleen Hoover, I think this author is capable of writing something some day that I will really enjoy. I like dark fiction, and I like suspense novels. She just needs to fine-tune the way she writes her heroes and sex scenes, and then we'll be golden.2 to 2.5 stars, error: Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestYou know when you're ordering a really strong drink from a bar, and it's got a lot more alcohol in it than you thought, to the point that you can almost taste the hangover over the rum and artificial fruit, and you think to yourself, \"This is a bad idea\" but then drink it anyway, and order another because YOLO? That's me every time I pick up a new adult book. I tell myself, \"Nenia, you're going to regret this, don't do it, you're not going to like it.\"But trashy erotica novels, like booze, are easy to do to excess.This is my second book by Penelope Douglas. The first I've read from her was CORRUPT, and that was lent to me by a kind GR friend via Kindle. I thought CORRUPT was okay, with reservations. I don't normally go in for erotica, especially erotica that reads like straight-up porn. All the men in that book were misogynistic and rapey, too, which added another level of nope. But the plot was decent and she was good at setting a decent pace, so I sort of half-enjoyed, half-wtf'd my way through the thing and at the end of the book, I wasn't mad. It was a flawed but decent read.PUNK 57 I bought myself, which already means that I'm going to be an eensy bit more critical of it because I'm spending my hard-earned money on the book and judging it accordingly. PUNK 57 was our book of the month in the Unapologetic Romance Readers group for April, and as someone who had read her work previously, I was interested in seeing how it had changed from CORRUPT.***WARNING: SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT***PUNK 57 is about two characters, Misha and Ryen, who are both in high school. They are also pen pals, although they have never met face to face before. Misha is punk and in a band and has piercings. Ryen is a cheerleader and preppy and into things like TWILIGHT and HARRY POTTER. After a tragedy happens in his life, Misha ends up going to Ryen's school under the name Masen for reasons that don't actually have anything to do with Ryen. When he realizes that she's not what he built her up to be on his imaginary pedestal, he gets angry and embarks on a mission to make her life hell. This, I actually didn't mind so much. It reminded me ofHana Yori Dango. A-hole heroes are actually a weakness of mine provided that a) the heroine reacts to this behavior accordingly and b) it takes a heck of a lot of groveling before the characters finally end up together.This does not happen in PUNK 57. Ryen is attracted to this mean behavior, despite herself, and the two of them have several sex scenes that have this really uncomfortable element that was also present in CORRUPT that is neither healthy nor entirely consensual (at least, that's how it felt tome). And it wasn't the fact that it wasn't 100% consensual at times that bothered me so much as the fact that Ryen seemed to be embracing this behavior as natural and something she needed. Example: at one point Misha/Masen breaks into her housewhile she's sleepingand catches her in bed naked.

            "Translation failed for: NOTICE (Please read this first): I'm happy to discuss my opinion of this book with you if you had a different take, but if your intent is merely to attack my opinion, I'm not interested.Since I posted this way back in 2008, a (very) small minority of this book's fans have taken my review personally and have written some very long, very insulting responses telling me why I'm wrong. So please allow me to clarify something -This ismy opinionof the book. It will undoubtedly differ from yours because we are not the same person. You are welcome to refute me by giving the book a much higher rating and more glowing review ...on your own account. You are also welcome to tell me you disagree below, but if you can't do it in a less-than-essay-long format, I will delete your comment. If you need to get nasty and personal with your remarks, I'll probably be reporting and blocking you as well.Connolly's \"Book of Lost Things\" came highly recommended as a modern take on the fantasy genre. What I found instead was a completely unlikeable main character, an array of interchangeable father figures, and a disappointing rehash of the usual fairy tale parodies.\"Lost Things\" centers on David, a boy whose mother dies and whose father remarries and has a second child, leaving David to bicker bitterly with his new stepmother while trying to avoid anxiety attacks that leave him blacked out and feverish. And that groundwork occurs in one of the most poorly paced info-dumps I've had the misfortune to read. The first chapter focuses on David and his mother, leading you to believe this will be the crux of the story - but alas, she dies. The second chapter focuses on the father's remarriage and David's anxiety attacks leading the reader to believe, perhaps, this is the focus of the story - it is not. The third and fourth chapters center on David's mostly absent father whose work is \"top secret\" and David's fights with his step-mother and we, the audience, raise our index fingers and say, \"Ah-ha! Top secret Dad! Conflict with the new parental figure! This, surely, is the story!\" But, alas, those are red-herrings as well. In fact, after the sixth chapter, neither of those characters appears again until the (two chapters long!) epilogue.Therealstory ends up being David's abduction into the land of fairy tales by the Crooked Man, a Rumpelstiltskin who makes vicious bargains with emotional children to feed his magical slave house. David starts off his true adventure by following the voice of his dead mother - but don't assume that the story somehow involves David's mother's spirit wandering painfully in the fantasy realm awaiting rescue, this too, in Connolly fashion, is completely irrelevant to the story. Instead, David wanders the fantasy realm accompanied by a series of nearly identical substitute fathers who end up betraying David's trust in one way or another - by being gay in one case (Roland), by being fallible in another (the generic Woodsman).In the end, David finds another potential father figure in Jonathon, and quickly realizes that not only is Jonathon a liar and a murderer, but also that he, David, no longer needs a father figure because he's now become a man of his own right. He then stares down Jonathon, the Crooked Man, and the vicious wolf monsters, who until that point only appeared in the story when Connolly felt the need to remind us that David was in danger because wolf monsters were chasing him; they never catch up to him except at the end and, as I said, David simply stares them down and wins by virtue of his newfound manhood.In all, \"Lost Things\" is a plodding, thinly veiled paean to a baby-boomer-era view of \"manhood\" as stoic resolution and resistance to all hurts, including mental and emotional. Perhaps this story plays better, and I don't wish to be insulting, with a female audience, one that's never had to grapple with questions of \"manliness\" or had to decide on an appropriate level of attachment to an older male. As for me, I was insulted that David begins the story emotionally wounded by what he views as a betrayal by his father and, instead of finding closure, he learns to just get over it and \"be a man\" about it.But a bigger insult, in my eyes, was the closing of the book - Connolly is so in love with his work that he follows up the main story withalmost 150 pagesof notes and commentary on his story: everything from the origins of the fairy tales he parodies to his woeful recollections of scenes that were cut from the final draft (murder your darlings, Connolly!). It's as jarring as it would be had Stephen King ended Christine with detailed descriptions of a Plymouth Belvedere and ten pages of him crying about the Arnie/Christine tailpipe sex scene that his editors excised from the final publication.This was my first experience with Connolly, and as it's his most highly recommended book, I'll probably pass on his work in the future., error: UWAGA (Proszę najpierw to przeczytać): Chętnie omówię z Tobą moją opinię na temat tej książki, jeśli masz inne zdanie, ale jeśli Twoim zamiarem jest jedynie zaatakowanie mojej opinii, nie jestem zainteresowany. Od czasu, gdy opublikowałem to w 2008 r., (bardzo) niewielka mniejszość fanów tej książki potraktowała moją recenzję osobiście i napisała kilka bardzo długich, bardzo obraźliwych odpowiedzi, w których wyjaśniła mi, dlaczego się mylę. Więc pozwól mi wyjaśnić coś - to jest moja opinia na temat książki. Niewątpliwie będzie się różnić od Twojej, ponieważ nie jesteśmy tą samą osobą. Możesz mi obalić moje zdanie, wystawiając książce znacznie wyższą ocenę i bardziej pochlebną recenzję... na własny rachunek. Możesz również powiedzieć mi, że się nie zgadzasz poniżej, ale jeśli nie możesz tego zrobić w formacie krótszym niż esej, usunę Twój komentarz. Jeśli chcesz być złośliwy i osobisty w swoich uwagach, prawdopodobnie zgłoszę cię i zablokuję. „Book of Lost Things” Connolly'ego została gorąco polecana jako współczesne podejście do gatunku fantasy. Zamiast tego znalazłem całkowicie nieprzyjemną główną postać, szereg wymiennych postaci ojcowskich i rozczarowujące odgrzewane kotlety zwykłych parodii baśni. „Lost Things” koncentruje się na Davidzie, chłopcu, którego matka umiera, a ojciec żeni się ponownie i ma drugie dziecko, pozostawiając Davida w gorzkiej sprzeczce z nową macochą, próbując jednocześnie unikać ataków lękowych, które pozostawiają go nieprzytomnego i gorączkowego. I to podłoże ma miejsce w jednym z najgorzej rozplanowanych info-zrzutów, jakie miałem nieszczęście przeczytać. Pierwszy rozdział koncentruje się na Davidzie i jego matce, co prowadzi do przekonania, że ​​będzie to sedno historii - ale niestety ona umiera. Drugi rozdział koncentruje się na ponownym małżeństwie ojca i atakach lękowych Davida, co prowadzi czytelnika do przekonania, że ​​być może to jest sedno historii - tak nie jest. Trzeci i czwarty rozdział skupiają się na ojcu Davida, którego praca jest „ściśle tajna”, kłótniach Davida z macochą, a my, widzowie, podnosimy palce wskazujące i mówimy: „Aha! Ściśle tajny tata! Konflikt z nową postacią rodzicielską! To z pewnością jest ta historia!”. Ale niestety, to również mylące tropy. W rzeczywistości po szóstym rozdziale żadna z tych postaci nie pojawia się ponownie aż do (dwóch rozdziałów!) epilogu. Ta historia kończy się porwaniem Davida do krainy baśni przez Crooked Mana, Rumpelsztyka, który zawiera okrutne układy z emocjonalnymi dziećmi, aby nakarmić swój magiczny dom niewolników. David rozpoczyna swoją prawdziwą przygodę, podążając za głosem swojej zmarłej matki - ale nie zakładaj, że historia w jakiś sposób obejmuje ducha matki Davida, który boleśnie błąka się po krainie fantazji, czekając na ratunek, to również, w stylu Connolly'ego, jest całkowicie nieistotne dla historii. Zamiast tego, David wędruje po krainie fantazji w towarzystwie serii niemal identycznych zastępczych ojców, którzy w ten czy inny sposób zdradzają zaufanie Davida - będąc gejem w jednym przypadku (Roland), będąc omylnym w innym (generyczny Drwal). Na koniec David znajduje inną potencjalną ojcowską postać w Jonathonie i szybko zdaje sobie sprawę, że nie tylko Jonathon jest kłamcą i mordercą, ale także, że on, David, nie potrzebuje już ojcowskiej postaci, ponieważ stał się mężczyzną na własnych prawach. Następnie wpatruje się w Jonathona, Crooked Mana i okrutne potwory wilków, które do tego momentu pojawiały się w opowieści tylko wtedy, gdy Connolly poczuł potrzebę przypomnienia nam, że David jest w niebezpieczeństwie, ponieważ ścigają go potwory wilków; nigdy go nie doganiają, poza końcem i, jak powiedziałem, David po prostu ich mierzi wzrokiem i wygrywa dzięki swojej nowo odkrytej męskości. Podsumowując, „Lost Things” to mozolny, cienko zawoalowany pean na cześć poglądu ery wyżu demograficznego na „męskość” jako stoickie postanowienie i opór wobec wszelkich krzywd, w tym psychicznych i emocjonalnych. Być może ta historia lepiej się sprawdzi, i nie chcę być obraźliwy, z żeńską publicznością, taką, która nigdy nie musiała zmagać się z kwestiami „męskości” ani decydować o odpowiednim poziomie przywiązania do starszego mężczyzny. Jeśli chodzi o mnie, obraziło mnie, że David zaczyna opowieść emocjonalnie zraniony tym, co uważa za zdradę ze strony ojca i zamiast znaleźć zakończenie, uczy się po prostu to przezwyciężyć i „być mężczyzną” w tej kwestii. Ale większą zniewagą, w moich oczach, było zakończenie książki - Connolly jest tak zakochany w swojej pracy, że kontynuuje główną historię prawie 150 stronami notatek i komentarzy na temat swojej historii: wszystko od pochodzenia parodiowanych przez siebie baśni po jego żałosne wspomnienia scen, które zostały wycięte z ostatecznej wersji (zamorduj swoje kochanie, Connolly!). Jest to tak samo rażące, jak gdyby Stephen King zakończył Christine szczegółowymi opisami Plymouth Belvedere i dziesięcioma stronami, na których płacze nad sceną seksu Arniego/Christine w rurze wydechowej, którą jego redaktorzy wycięli z ostatecznej wersji. To było moje pierwsze spotkanie z Connollym i ponieważ jest to jego najbardziej polecana książka, prawdopodobnie w przyszłości odpuszczę sobie jego twórczość. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: Don Tillman is an Associate Professor of Genetics with (probably) Asperger’s Syndrome who has decided that, as he is nearing 40, he will solve “the wife problem” (ie. not being married) by creating a questionnaire that will ascertain, for him, the perfect wife and then marry her. That is until he meets Rosie, a grad student working part-time in a gay bar who’s looking for her biological father, and slowly Don’s “Wife Project” becomes “The Rosie Project” as he realises he’s falling in love with her.I say that Don probably has Aspergers because it’s never explicitly stated but as he narrates the book in the first person, the reader is immediately aware that he sees the world differently than the rest of us. It’s kind of like having Sheldon Cooper from “The Big Bang Theory” talking to you - Don is a genius with no social skills who’s unable to read facial expressions and has a highly regimented lifestyle and peculiar way of speaking. Couple that with the opening scene where he gives a talk on Aspergers and it’s highly suggested that he has it. Not knowing anyone with Aspergers, I can’t tell whether he sounds convincingly like someone with it but what little I know of the condition suggests that his personality is unlikely to change as dramatically as Don’s does throughout the book. It’s almost like his meeting Rosie reverses the condition. I mean, he’s unable to feel love - but he can? He’s unable to read facial expressions or understand social conventions - but then he can?Nevertheless I thought the first 200 pages of the book were charming. Don is a likeable guy whose eccentric lifestyle makes a change of pace to the usual rom-com formula and the different angle it gives to the genre made me interested in it even though romantic comedies aren’t usually my thing. There were also some excellent scenes that stuck out memorably like Don and Rosie’s first date, from using aikido on the waiters to altering time and having dinner on a whiteboard (not as surreal as it sounds but nice touches anyway), and Don and Rosie’s moonlighting as cocktail waiters and Don using his remarkable memory (eidetic?) to take complex drink orders for dozens of people at a time. I read the first two-thirds of the book in a couple days, smiling a lot throughout. And then I got to the final third which took me over a week and ruined the book for me.The first 200 pages had been unique to the rom-com genre and felt highly original which is why I responded so well to it - it wasn’t going over the same ground countless other stories had gone over before. The final third is all about convention and it opens with a scene in New York. The story is set in Australia but because Don and Rosie are hell bent on finding Rosie’s biological father, their search takes them to two possible fathers in NY. This 50 page section felt completely contrived and could’ve been cut from the book entirely.This book was originally a screenplay and these scenes felt very cinematic and included so that film backers would have recognisable locations for their film to make it easier to sell, rather than serving the story. Yes, the finding Rosie’s real dad storyline is in play but if you took those two people away from NY and cut it entirely, the book would’ve been snappier. As such it feels really contrived and dull, like the scene in the movie where the two romantic leads get to do a kind of montage sequence of things. It also constantly references other romantic comedy movies the entire time too, adding to the feeling that this is a homage to the genre and included because that’s what’s expected when you do something like this.Then the final 70 or so pages are about Don winning Rosie back and it’s done in such a conventionally rom-com way that I totally lost interest. Worse, Don’s character didn’t seem consistent in this part either (see the criticisms in the Aspergers section above).I’ve used the label “romantic-comedy” throughout because that’s what the marketing says it is but it’s not. It’s romantic, sure, but it’s not funny. I didn’t laugh once and didn’t think Don’s numerous social faux pas to be particularly funny either. Worse still are the scenes which are clumsily designed to be funny and feel very forced, like when Don is learning sexual positions from a book and uses a skeleton (he’s at the university for this scene so it’s not a Dahmer moment or anything) and the Dean walks in on him. It feels like the kind of scene in a sitcom where the canned laughter goes on and on as the camera switches from Don’s face to the Dean’s and back again while the audience begins to clap and laugh at the same time. It might as well be labelled “funny scene”. And it’s not.Despite my criticisms, I was quite happy to give this book 3 stars - until I read the end. Now I know the ending shouldn’t have more importance over any other aspect of the story, whatever the genre, but the ending to this book is especially bad. So Rosie, at the very start when she’s introduced to Don, tells him about her dad Phil, a man who raised her alone after her mum died when Rosie was 12, who’s a person whom she doesn’t particularly get along with (largely because of a minor quibble which she’s unreasonably held against him for her entire life) - but no more so than any other person who doesn’t get along with their mum or dad for whatever reason. Except she’s convinced herself he can’t possibly be her real dad and that her real dad must be out there somewhere. This is basically the motivation for everything Don and Rosie do in this entire book and right off, I thought “I bet it turns out Phil IS her real dad after all”. Well... I won’t give it away but you can kind of guess what happens in the end. And I really, really hated that. Don all but says what I was feeling in the second-to-final sentence of the book and I immediately dropped the book down another star.This book definitely has some good moments and Don is a memorable and oftentimes delightful character, but the final third of the book really frustrated me. If the book had been more tightly edited with the NY sequence thrown out and had had a less predictable ending, I would be enthusiastically recommending this novel. As it is, it is a flawed debut novel that’s well written but severely lacking in crucial parts of the story reducing it from a charmingly quirky romance story to yet another rom-com with no surprises and a sloppily rushed final act.

Simply putting a mirror up to the world can be interesting, even enlightening, but it rarely stirs my blood or makes me feel anything beyond purely intellectual admiration. It's also true that I have no love for the drama of suburban disaffection and infidelity. That I still kind of admired the book despite this heavily stacked deck is a testament to Franzen's writerly professionalism. When I sayprofessionalismrather than something likebrillianceI don't mean to damn him with faint praise -- well, I do, but the praise is sincere despite its faintness. Based solely onFreedom-- I never finishedThe Corrections, to my embarrassment -- I think Franzen is more a skilled (but overreaching) craftsman than the epochal artist he's being sold as, if you'll forgive a tired dichotomy. See, just about everyone, hagiographer and agnostic alike, has noted that the book is thoroughly readable and absorbing. Franzen's craftsmanship lies in his mastery of the fundamentals -- how to structure a story, introduce a character, craft prose that speeds along with momentum, etc -- that lead to prime readability. But why is it that, each time I put the book down after being reasonably absorbed, I felt a bad taste in my mouth?Despite his vaunted observational acumen -- which, to be honest, I found kind of blinkered and basic -- Franzen's treatment of his characters is too often tainted by he-said she-said superficiality. This book reads like your smartest friend talking smack about your other friends. Or, perhaps, given Franzen's fixation on familial resentment, a better metaphor might be your cranky uncle kvetching eloquently about your bratty cousins. Which might sound like a bit of bitchy fun, but remember we're talking about 500+ pages here, and that shit getsold.

What's missing is compassion. Without authorial compassion for his troubled characters, those characters' development gets arrested at a half-baked, shallow level, no matter how frantically Franzen limns their consciousnesses. Franzen keeps digging and digging, but he never gets past the surface, because he's using the wrong shovel. When he finally tries a little tenderness at the end, it's like the deathbed conversion of a lifelong atheist: sincere, but untrustworthy.Where theNew York Timessees a genius who uses his \"profound moral intelligence\" to \"illuminate the world we thought we knew,\" I see a good writer who has crafted a cynical soap opera against a ripped-from-the-headlines Bush-era backdrop (ensuring baseless \"Great American Novel\" hosannas from the press).Melodramawould, I suppose, be a kinder term thansoap operaorgossip column, but that genre designation carries certain associations -- blatant artificiality, crying-on-the-outside catharsis, stylistic opulence -- that don't apply here. And yet the book does, at times, feel like little more than a bad melodrama, a dour monotony representing neither the real world of emotions nor a freshly imagined authorial perspective on same.And you know, if Franzen wanted to explore how Americans abuse their personal and political freedoms, I'm not sure why he chose such a blandly familiar cycle of jerks-hurting-jerks to express this potentially interesting theme. Mistakes are made; resentment simmers; betrayal explodes; lather, rinse, repeat, pass on to younger generation. Marriage is hard, depression is insidious, infidelity can be a moral gray area, children shape their lives in reaction to their parents' lives, etc. I don't claim to be the world's closest reader, but I just don't see the profundity in that. Not that profundity is a requirement of good fiction, but apart from the finely crafted prose I'm not sure this book even justifies its existence. Franzen buries his would-be thesis in an aside about somebody's immigrant grandfather:The personality susceptible to the dream of limitless freedom is a personality also prone, should the dream ever sour, to misanthropy and rage. OK, that has a nice aphoristic ring to it. But who are the personalities susceptible to limitless freedom -- all Americans? If Franzen is saying that all Americans are prone to misanthropy and rage, I have three responses to that: 1) No shit, Sherlock. 2) That's not unique to Americans. 3) What exactly does freedom have to do with misanthropy? What's the causality there? If that's the question you tried to answer with your book, Franzy, I don't think you pulled it off.

            "Translation failed for: Everyone knows about the Tudors. Even people not particularly interested in history know the bare bones of the story, and people world-wide all seem to have heard about Henry VIII. I suspect it is one of the most popular periods to study in English history with its cast of colourful characters, intrigues, passions, extremes, extravagances, important political and religious changes and mind-blowingly violent events. Why then wasWolf Hallsuch a slog to get through?For a start Hilary Mantel writes unconventionally in the present tense. She also seems to have attempted a strange stylistic form where she disguises the characters. The reader is forever backtracking through the pages to check who is actually talking.\"He\", I discovered, usually refers to Thomas Cromwell. The action does revolve around his life, but he is rarely named unless it is\"He, Cromwell\"and even this appellation is rare.Sometimes not specifying characters is just sloppy writing. Take the following sentence:\"The evening before Fisher is to die, he visits More.\"Who is the subject in this sentence? (It comes at the start of a new section, so there are no preceding ones.) It is a simple sentence in which clearly\"he\"refers to\"Fisher\"doesn't it? Not by Mantel's rules it doesn't.\"He\", confusingly means\"Cromwell\".The names used in this period were extremely restricted, compared with our present-day choices. There were so many Thomases and Marys, Henrys and Janes - and Mantel has a huge cast of characters. The list at the front of the book runs to nearly 5 pages (and then there are yet more pages of family trees….) Even so, many peripheral characters are not in the list, and when they are their names are not used in a helpful way. Richard Riche should be an easy name to remember shouldn't it? Except that for some unknown reason Mantel sometimes refers to him as\"Purse\". Another instance is the character Thomas Wriotheseley, who is sometimes called\"Risley\"or even, obscurely\"Call-me\"(a very early reference to his saying\"Call me Risley\"near the beginning of the book.)An example running throughout the book is of a nun on the continent who makes prophecies against the king. She is referred to variously as\"the Maid\"or\"the nun.\"Later on in the book she is referred to as\"Eliza,\"and later again,\"Barton.\"It is only near the end of the book when she is about to be put to death that she is given her name,\"Elizabeth Barton\"(and at this point I discovered her in the list of characters.) I have to assume that this was an attempt to reflect her diminishing status. When she may have been making what people believed to be legitimate holy prophecies, she had titles such as\"the nun\", and when she was discredited she was given back her simple lawful name. But it is the author who has done this! It is too obscure a point, if indeed it is deliberate, for a reader to easily pick up, especially when there are a plethora of other characters to sort out.Add into the formula a Thomas, Tom or \"he\" - or instances where the character is simply called by their title,\"Duke\", and the reader is lost in clouds of deception. Indeed it is almost as if Mantel has used obfuscation as a deliberate way to misinform and disguise who is talking, who the action is about, much as the Tudor times were about misinformation, deception and disingenuousness. Hans (Holbein - the painter - I was inordinately pleased to work that one out for myself without referring to \"the list\"!) sums up the religious situation,\"Images, not images. Statues, not statues. It is the body of God, it is not the body of God, it is sort of the body of God. It is his blood, it is not his blood. Priests may marry, they may not…. The crucifix we creep to on our knees and reverence with our lips or the crucifix we chop it up and burn it in the public square…. Luther refers to \"His Disgrace, the king of England.\"\"The book appears at a glance to be an easy read. Most of it is conversation, and in a reasonably modern style at that - not a \"forsooth\" in sight. But Mantel's use of punctuation leaves a lot to be desired. Her overuse of the colon and semi-colon is frankly irritating. Why not start a new sentence occasionally? Plus the inverted commas (or speech marks) seem to be used in a very ad hoc fashion. The convention is that if inverted commas are not used when a character speaks, then this is to convey internal dialogue - the character is thinking. There are many instances inWolf Hallwhere this is not so. The use of inverted commas seems completely random, which slows down the pace of reading and only serves to confuse the reader even more.The novel would have benefited from rigorous editing. The first half drags. Dozens of character are thrown into the mix and we get no sense of definition, or attempt at characterisation. Minor characters could easily be substituted for one another - they are so sketchily drawn. Women feature hardly at all, except in Cromwell's immediate family, and the many men drift in and out of the narrative in their wooden fashion as the reader desperately looks back to try and sort out who they all are. It does not help that the events are not chronological. Cromwell's memories frequently take on a life of their own and divert the \"action\".There are indications of an editor's hand however. The \"cast list\" is an obvious example. An editor probably informed the author that nobody except a Tudor scholar would make head or tail of the characters without one. If it was not Mantel's idea, then that goes some way to explaining why it is not fully comprehensive. Maybe a glossary would have helped further.Another anomaly which reeks to me of editorial suggestion, is the way the novel starts. The violence of Cromwell's father towards him is described in a gratuitously detailed and graphic way. Welcome to the novel. Is this what it will be like all the way through? Well no, actually. The only other instance of such an unpleasant descriptive account is the burning of a woman (a\"Loller\") accused of being a heretic. This is put in presumably to show the influence on a young Cromwell (as presumably the opening section was) - part of what made him the man he was. But this is an extremely long novel, and it is inappropriate to start a dry, lifeless tome with such an atypical style of writing. Unless, of course, the author has been told to \"Start with something exciting. Get the reader interested!\"In these ways, and more, the mechanics of the novel are far too evident. The reader should be swept up in the events, not have to plod through dull prose and linguistic contrivances. I do wonder what other authors would have made of such promising material. Tracey Chevalier would have made you care about each and every one of the characters, however despicable or duplicitous they may have been. The \"cast list\" would have been considerably pruned. Maybe Peter Ackroyd would have included more characters, but he would not have obscured who he was actually talking about! Neither would Simon Winchester, who would play up the consciences and feelings of the main players. Hilary Mantel has not decided how to focus her novel, or to give it any sense of purpose. She merely chronicles events from 1500-1535. The early years, when Cromwell was a youngster, are sketchily drawn. Most of the narrative is concentrated on the last 3 or 4 years leading up to the \"Act of Supremacy\" in 1534, whereby Henry was stated to be the Supreme Head of the Church of England.

An heir to the throne could at the king's whim be redesignated a bastard. It should have been a rollicking read. And Thomas Cromwell - or should I term him,\"He, Thomas\"- should have come across as a mesmeric figure, not the ambiguous shadow the reader is left with. This is an ambitious novel about the era, which disappointingly turns out to be a bit of a damp squib., error: Everyone knows about the Tudors. Even people not particularly interested in history know the bare bones of the story, and people world-wide all seem to have heard about Henry VIII. I suspect it is one of the most popular periods to study in English history with its cast of colourful characters, intrigues, passions, extremes, extravagances, important political and religious changes and mind-blowingly violent events. Why then wasWolf Hallsuch a slog to get through?For a start Hilary Mantel writes unconventionally in the present tense. She also seems to have attempted a strange stylistic form where she disguises the characters. The reader is forever backtracking through the pages to check who is actually talking.\"He\", I discovered, usually refers to Thomas Cromwell. The action does revolve around his life, but he is rarely named unless it is\"He, Cromwell\"and even this appellation is rare.Sometimes not specifying characters is just sloppy writing. Take the following sentence:\"The evening before Fisher is to die, he visits More.\"Who is the subject in this sentence? (It comes at the start of a new section, so there are no preceding ones.) It is a simple sentence in which clearly\"he\"refers to\"Fisher\"doesn't it? Not by Mantel's rules it doesn't.\"He\", confusingly means\"Cromwell\".The names used in this period were extremely restricted, compared with our present-day choices. There were so many Thomases and Marys, Henrys and Janes - and Mantel has a huge cast of characters. The list at the front of the book runs to nearly 5 pages (and then there are yet more pages of family trees….) Even so, many peripheral characters are not in the list, and when they are their names are not used in a helpful way. Richard Riche should be an easy name to remember shouldn't it? Except that for some unknown reason Mantel sometimes refers to him as\"Purse\". Another instance is the character Thomas Wriotheseley, who is sometimes called\"Risley\"or even, obscurely\"Call-me\"(a very early reference to his saying\"Call me Risley\"near the beginning of the book.)An example running throughout the book is of a nun on the continent who makes prophecies against the king. She is referred to variously as\"the Maid\"or\"the nun.\"Later on in the book she is referred to as\"Eliza,\"and later again,\"Barton.\"It is only near the end of the book when she is about to be put to death that she is given her name,\"Elizabeth Barton\"(and at this point I discovered her in the list of characters.) I have to assume that this was an attempt to reflect her diminishing status. When she may have been making what people believed to be legitimate holy prophecies, she had titles such as\"the nun\", and when she was discredited she was given back her simple lawful name. But it is the author who has done this! It is too obscure a point, if indeed it is deliberate, for a reader to easily pick up, especially when there are a plethora of other characters to sort out.Add into the formula a Thomas, Tom or \"he\" - or instances where the character is simply called by their title,\"Duke\", and the reader is lost in clouds of deception. Indeed it is almost as if Mantel has used obfuscation as a deliberate way to misinform and disguise who is talking, who the action is about, much as the Tudor times were about misinformation, deception and disingenuousness. Hans (Holbein - the painter - I was inordinately pleased to work that one out for myself without referring to \"the list\"!) sums up the religious situation,\"Images, not images. Statues, not statues. It is the body of God, it is not the body of God, it is sort of the body of God. It is his blood, it is not his blood. Priests may marry, they may not…. The crucifix we creep to on our knees and reverence with our lips or the crucifix we chop it up and burn it in the public square…. Luther refers to \"His Disgrace, the king of England.\"\"The book appears at a glance to be an easy read. Most of it is conversation, and in a reasonably modern style at that - not a \"forsooth\" in sight. But Mantel's use of punctuation leaves a lot to be desired. Her overuse of the colon and semi-colon is frankly irritating. Why not start a new sentence occasionally? Plus the inverted commas (or speech marks) seem to be used in a very ad hoc fashion. The convention is that if inverted commas are not used when a character speaks, then this is to convey internal dialogue - the character is thinking. There are many instances inWolf Hallwhere this is not so. The use of inverted commas seems completely random, which slows down the pace of reading and only serves to confuse the reader even more.The novel would have benefited from rigorous editing. The first half drags. Dozens of character are thrown into the mix and we get no sense of definition, or attempt at characterisation. Minor characters could easily be substituted for one another - they are so sketchily drawn. Women feature hardly at all, except in Cromwell's immediate family, and the many men drift in and out of the narrative in their wooden fashion as the reader desperately looks back to try and sort out who they all are. It does not help that the events are not chronological. Cromwell's memories frequently take on a life of their own and divert the \"action\".There are indications of an editor's hand however. The \"cast list\" is an obvious example. An editor probably informed the author that nobody except a Tudor scholar would make head or tail of the characters without one. If it was not Mantel's idea, then that goes some way to explaining why it is not fully comprehensive. Maybe a glossary would have helped further.Another anomaly which reeks to me of editorial suggestion, is the way the novel starts. The violence of Cromwell's father towards him is described in a gratuitously detailed and graphic way. Welcome to the novel. Is this what it will be like all the way through? Well no, actually. The only other instance of such an unpleasant descriptive account is the burning of a woman (a\"Loller\") accused of being a heretic. This is put in presumably to show the influence on a young Cromwell (as presumably the opening section was) - part of what made him the man he was. But this is an extremely long novel, and it is inappropriate to start a dry, lifeless tome with such an atypical style of writing. Unless, of course, the author has been told to \"Start with something exciting. Get the reader interested!\"In these ways, and more, the mechanics of the novel are far too evident. The reader should be swept up in the events, not have to plod through dull prose and linguistic contrivances. I do wonder what other authors would have made of such promising material. Tracey Chevalier would have made you care about each and every one of the characters, however despicable or duplicitous they may have been. The \"cast list\" would have been considerably pruned. Maybe Peter Ackroyd would have included more characters, but he would not have obscured who he was actually talking about! Neither would Simon Winchester, who would play up the consciences and feelings of the main players. Hilary Mantel has not decided how to focus her novel, or to give it any sense of purpose. She merely chronicles events from 1500-1535. The early years, when Cromwell was a youngster, are sketchily drawn. Most of the narrative is concentrated on the last 3 or 4 years leading up to the \"Act of Supremacy\" in 1534, whereby Henry was stated to be the Supreme Head of the Church of England.

            "Translation failed for: It is possible to read too much into a picture book. A funny statement since what were talking about is literature for people who haven't even seen a decade of time pass them by. But historically picture books have been places where prejudices are both intentionally and unintentionally on display. Yet for everyDenverby David McKee (a picture book about the beauty of trickle down economics) you'll find fifty people reading WAY too much into something likeRainbow Fish(Communist propaganda) orClick Clack Moo(inculcating kids into unionism). The thing is, picture books are meant to teach and inform our children. Yet along the way a parent or gatekeeper might be worried about the unintentional messages getting pushed along the way. At the end of the day you have to weigh your reactions carefully. You can't be pointing fingers left and right, claiming authorial intent where there is none. Okay. So round about now you're trying to figure out what the heck any of this has to do withThe Day the Crayons Quitby Drew Daywalt. I mean, talk about an innocuous title. Why am I going on and on about unintentional messages in works of children's fiction in preface to talking about this book? Well, here's the trouble. I have a major problem with this story and it's entirely possible that it's just in my own head. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to lay out the facts as they stand and you can judge for yourself whether or not this book does indeed make a major you-can't-do-that-in-the-21st-century mistake, or if I'm simply suffering from a case of Reading Too Much Into It. Either way, it sure makes this Daywalt/Jeffers collaboration into an interesting point of discussion.Duncan's your average kid. Not the kind of person who's going to expect that when he reaches for his crayons at school he is, instead, going to find himself with a bundle of letters. Each letter is from a different crayon voicing their complaints. Says gray, \"I know that elephants are gray but that's a lot of space to color in all by myself.\" Or pink saying, \"Could you please use me sometime to color the occasional pink dinosaur or monster or cowboy?\" Red and blue need a rest, white feels empty, yellow and orange both claim the sun, and all black ever wanted in life was, for once, to color in a rainbow or a beach ball. By the end of the letters Duncan wants to make the crayons happy. And that's when he comes up with the perfect solution to everybody's woes.Now let's talk crayon history for a bit. This is fun. In 1962 the U.S. Civil Rights Movement was underway. America was going through big changes. Assumptions that had lain dormant for years were finally getting challenged and even crayons were getting a double glance. You see 1962 was the year that Crayola decided to officially change the crayon known as \"flesh\" to \"peach\". You see where I am going with this, I suspect. While white children certainly would use the color as flesh, it wasn't exactly on the up and up to assume that white was the de facto skin color. Fast forward to 2013 and the publication ofThe Day the Crayons Quit. Peach does indeed make an appearance in this book and in that section complains vociferously that its wrapper has been removed. \"Now I'm NAKED and too embarrassed to leave the crayon box. I don't even have any underwear!\" That Daywalt is linking peach to flesh again is no crime. Interestingly, on the previous page the pink crayon has been making a very different complaint about never being allowed to draw cowboys or dinos or monsters. The monster that it HAS drawn is covering its private parts, obviously believing itself to be naked as well, as the dinosaur points and laughs. So. Pink and peach are clearly equated with flesh tones.Then what's the deal with brown?There is only one vaguely brownish crayon in this book and it is the much maligned beige. The official brown does not make an appearance it would seem. Beige's sadness is the fact that while \"Brown gets all the bears, ponies and puppies . . . the only things I get are turkey dinners (if I'm lucky) and wheat.\"Mmm hmm.This is precisely where the difficulty comes into play. How much am I reading into this through my own prejudices? Let me give you a bit of comparison. This year is also seeing the publication ofThe Black Rabbitby Philippa Leathers. In that particular book a little white rabbit keeps seeing a \"scary\" big black rabbit that he runs away from. The black rabbit is, in fact, the little rabbit's own shadow and at the end he comes to love the big black rabbit after all. A librarian recently commented to me that it would have been far preferable if the little rabbit had been brown or some other color. Otherwise you have a book where a white character fears a big black one. At first I was inclined to agree, but after thinking about it I wasn't so sure. After all, the white rabbit's fears are entirely in its own head. There's also the fact that the book, I believe, is originally Australian, so the author wasn't working with a lot of the codes and keys common in American culture. I was even reminded of the huge brouhaha surroundingThe Rabbits' Weddingby Garth Williams. In 1958 the Alabama state library system removed the book from circulation because it featured a black rabbit and a white rabbit getting married. But sometimes a rabbit is just a rabbit.So is a crayon just a crayon? I think the difference may lie in what a kid gets out of reading this book. In the case ofThe Black Rabbit, few kids are going to equate themselves with fluffy bunnies. Even if they do, the black rabbit is ultimately the hero of the story. There's a bit of a difference with crayons. Kids are constantly coloring themselves and the people they love with the crayons they have on hand. Crayola, knowing this, even released a brand of multicultural crayons of varying brown tones in response to the public's desire for that very product. So to produce a book where pink and flesh are equated with skin tones and that possibility isn't even considered with beige or brown makes for a complicated reading. It's an easy mistake to make if you're not thinking about it at first, but you would have thought that someone in the course of editing this thing might have brought the point up with Mr. Daywalt. Heck, they might have brought it up with Jeffers too, since he's the one who came up with the naked monster picture in the first place.Getting away from brown, beige, and peach crayons entirely, let's look at the book in terms of its other merits. When I was a kid I definitely ascribed personalities to inanimate objects. Not just dolls and toys, oh no. I could turn a game of War into a long drawn out romantic epic, thanks to the personalities ascribed to various playing cards. And crayons were no exception. Each one had a different part to play. They dealt with jealousies and romances, the whole nine yards. So in that frame of mind,The Day the Crayons Quitspeaks to something very real. Kids like to believe that the objects that they play with are as invested in the experience as the kids themselves. So Daywalt has clearly found a unique but necessary niche. If he follows the book up with a story of playing cards we'll know he's on the right track.This is also an epistolary picture book. I don't know if Daywalt knows this, but a common assignment given by a variety of different elementary school teachers requires kids to read epistolary books (Dear Mrs. LaRue,The Journey of Oliver K. Woodman, etc.). As such,The Day the Crayons Quitis no doubt destined to remain on multiple children's book lists for decades and decades to come.Which is a bit of a pity since the book itself is tailor made for an adult readership. Sure, some kids are going to get a real kick out of it. But as I read through the book I kept thinking that were it not for the art of Oliver Jeffers, this title would be a difficult read. After all, it's pretty much all about the words. Jeffers does what he can to give as much life and vitality as he can to the text, but there are twelve letters in here and around the orange and yellow crayons you'll be forgiven if your attention starts to wane.That's why the success of the book (and success it indeed is) can be ascribed primarily to its illustrator. I began to notice that the childlike style of the art can really, believably be the style of a kid. This is undoubtedly why Jeffers was picked for the project in the first place. Aside from David Shannon it can be difficult to find artists that replicate children's art styles without coming off as half-cooked. Jeffers has also taken great pains to put in as many small clever details as possible, and it makes for a very rewarding rereading. At first you wouldn't notice. His Santa on a fire truck is straightforward. The dragon accidentally burning a clump of grapes is cute but for me the book really picks up with (no surprise here) the moment when Jeffers gets to draw a penguin. Even the paper he chooses for each crayon is interesting and significant. Admittedly I was a little surprised that the purple crayon's letter wasn't written on lined paper (since it's such a stickler for staying inside the lines) while the gray crayon's was. His faux coloring books are fun in and of themselves but it's the final picture that's worth it. There are a lot of hat tips to the crayons' demands to be found here, from black rainbows to white cats. I think the character of Duncan still totally forgot to pay heed to blue's request, but otherwise it's on the up and up. You could even ignore that all the humans are drawn with pink or peach or white crayons, if you had half a mind to.That's sort of what makes the problems I have with the book such a bummer. There's really good stuff going on here! Oliver Jeffers is fun to watch no matter what he does and Daywalt has the makings of a fine author for kids. The troubles come when you look at what the book is saying. Fans of a certain stripe are sure to disregard my concerns with a wave of their hand. \"She's reading WAY too much into this\", they might say. Probably. But it seems to me that you cannot write a book about crayons and mention peach and pink as naked without acknowledging that not every kid in the world thinks of those colors as a flesh tones. I mean, that's just obvious. Here's beige again: \"I am BEIGE and I am proud.\" Beige power, eh? Come on, little crayon. Time for you to think outside the box., error: It is possible to read too much into a picture book.

Not the kind of person who's going to expect that when he reaches for his crayons at school he is, instead, going to find himself with a bundle of letters. Each letter is from a different crayon voicing their complaints. Says gray, \"I know that elephants are gray but that's a lot of space to color in all by myself.\" Or pink saying, \"Could you please use me sometime to color the occasional pink dinosaur or monster or cowboy?\" Red and blue need a rest, white feels empty, yellow and orange both claim the sun, and all black ever wanted in life was, for once, to color in a rainbow or a beach ball. By the end of the letters Duncan wants to make the crayons happy. And that's when he comes up with the perfect solution to everybody's woes.Now let's talk crayon history for a bit. This is fun. In 1962 the U.S. Civil Rights Movement was underway. America was going through big changes. Assumptions that had lain dormant for years were finally getting challenged and even crayons were getting a double glance. You see 1962 was the year that Crayola decided to officially change the crayon known as \"flesh\" to \"peach\". You see where I am going with this, I suspect. While white children certainly would use the color as flesh, it wasn't exactly on the up and up to assume that white was the de facto skin color. Fast forward to 2013 and the publication ofThe Day the Crayons Quit. Peach does indeed make an appearance in this book and in that section complains vociferously that its wrapper has been removed. \"Now I'm NAKED and too embarrassed to leave the crayon box. I don't even have any underwear!\" That Daywalt is linking peach to flesh again is no crime. Interestingly, on the previous page the pink crayon has been making a very different complaint about never being allowed to draw cowboys or dinos or monsters. The monster that it HAS drawn is covering its private parts, obviously believing itself to be naked as well, as the dinosaur points and laughs. So. Pink and peach are clearly equated with flesh tones.Then what's the deal with brown?There is only one vaguely brownish crayon in this book and it is the much maligned beige. The official brown does not make an appearance it would seem. Beige's sadness is the fact that while \"Brown gets all the bears, ponies and puppies . . . the only things I get are turkey dinners (if I'm lucky) and wheat.\"Mmm hmm.This is precisely where the difficulty comes into play. How much am I reading into this through my own prejudices? Let me give you a bit of comparison. This year is also seeing the publication ofThe Black Rabbitby Philippa Leathers. In that particular book a little white rabbit keeps seeing a \"scary\" big black rabbit that he runs away from. The black rabbit is, in fact, the little rabbit's own shadow and at the end he comes to love the big black rabbit after all. A librarian recently commented to me that it would have been far preferable if the little rabbit had been brown or some other color. Otherwise you have a book where a white character fears a big black one. At first I was inclined to agree, but after thinking about it I wasn't so sure. After all, the white rabbit's fears are entirely in its own head. There's also the fact that the book, I believe, is originally Australian, so the author wasn't working with a lot of the codes and keys common in American culture. I was even reminded of the huge brouhaha surroundingThe Rabbits' Weddingby Garth Williams. In 1958 the Alabama state library system removed the book from circulation because it featured a black rabbit and a white rabbit getting married. But sometimes a rabbit is just a rabbit.So is a crayon just a crayon? I think the difference may lie in what a kid gets out of reading this book. In the case ofThe Black Rabbit, few kids are going to equate themselves with fluffy bunnies. Even if they do, the black rabbit is ultimately the hero of the story. There's a bit of a difference with crayons. Kids are constantly coloring themselves and the people they love with the crayons they have on hand. Crayola, knowing this, even released a brand of multicultural crayons of varying brown tones in response to the public's desire for that very product. So to produce a book where pink and flesh are equated with skin tones and that possibility isn't even considered with beige or brown makes for a complicated reading. It's an easy mistake to make if you're not thinking about it at first, but you would have thought that someone in the course of editing this thing might have brought the point up with Mr. Daywalt. Heck, they might have brought it up with Jeffers too, since he's the one who came up with the naked monster picture in the first place.Getting away from brown, beige, and peach crayons entirely, let's look at the book in terms of its other merits. When I was a kid I definitely ascribed personalities to inanimate objects. Not just dolls and toys, oh no. I could turn a game of War into a long drawn out romantic epic, thanks to the personalities ascribed to various playing cards. And crayons were no exception. Each one had a different part to play. They dealt with jealousies and romances, the whole nine yards. So in that frame of mind,The Day the Crayons Quitspeaks to something very real. Kids like to believe that the objects that they play with are as invested in the experience as the kids themselves. So Daywalt has clearly found a unique but necessary niche. If he follows the book up with a story of playing cards we'll know he's on the right track.This is also an epistolary picture book. I don't know if Daywalt knows this, but a common assignment given by a variety of different elementary school teachers requires kids to read epistolary books (Dear Mrs. LaRue,The Journey of Oliver K. Woodman, etc.). As such,The Day the Crayons Quitis no doubt destined to remain on multiple children's book lists for decades and decades to come.Which is a bit of a pity since the book itself is tailor made for an adult readership. Sure, some kids are going to get a real kick out of it. But as I read through the book I kept thinking that were it not for the art of Oliver Jeffers, this title would be a difficult read. After all, it's pretty much all about the words. Jeffers does what he can to give as much life and vitality as he can to the text, but there are twelve letters in here and around the orange and yellow crayons you'll be forgiven if your attention starts to wane.That's why the success of the book (and success it indeed is) can be ascribed primarily to its illustrator. I began to notice that the childlike style of the art can really, believably be the style of a kid. This is undoubtedly why Jeffers was picked for the project in the first place. Aside from David Shannon it can be difficult to find artists that replicate children's art styles without coming off as half-cooked. Jeffers has also taken great pains to put in as many small clever details as possible, and it makes for a very rewarding rereading. At first you wouldn't notice. His Santa on a fire truck is straightforward. The dragon accidentally burning a clump of grapes is cute but for me the book really picks up with (no surprise here) the moment when Jeffers gets to draw a penguin. Even the paper he chooses for each crayon is interesting and significant. Admittedly I was a little surprised that the purple crayon's letter wasn't written on lined paper (since it's such a stickler for staying inside the lines) while the gray crayon's was. His faux coloring books are fun in and of themselves but it's the final picture that's worth it. There are a lot of hat tips to the crayons' demands to be found here, from black rainbows to white cats. I think the character of Duncan still totally forgot to pay heed to blue's request, but otherwise it's on the up and up. You could even ignore that all the humans are drawn with pink or peach or white crayons, if you had half a mind to.That's sort of what makes the problems I have with the book such a bummer. There's really good stuff going on here! Oliver Jeffers is fun to watch no matter what he does and Daywalt has the makings of a fine author for kids. The troubles come when you look at what the book is saying. Fans of a certain stripe are sure to disregard my concerns with a wave of their hand. \"She's reading WAY too much into this\", they might say. Probably. But it seems to me that you cannot write a book about crayons and mention peach and pink as naked without acknowledging that not every kid in the world thinks of those colors as a flesh tones. I mean, that's just obvious. Here's beige again: \"I am BEIGE and I am proud.\" Beige power, eh? Come on, little crayon. Time for you to think outside the box. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

The constant use of sentences that contain \"like\" similes gets annoying. I always feel there's a better way to write comparisons. Ballard's relentless attempts to equate gore and sexuality are as often as not crude and honed by a sledgehammer, as if by mentioning both in the same sentence that somehow their merger makes sense.

I think it’s a fine, easy read but absolutely nothing special. Emily Henry’s name attached will make it special to a lot of readers and that’s fine. Sally Thorne is that kind of author for me. I thought it had potential, a lot of it, but it ultimately fell so flat. That disappointment made me the most upset. I gave it 2.5 stars for the “fine” easiness of it, but I didn’t round up because I think it could’ve been more than fine but it wasn’t and that’s the boob punch.Full review below. Sorry if I’ve wrecked your dreams of this one. Personally, I didn’t like it but I’ve been told I’m petty. This is the part I should say “but I hope you love the book!” But my previously established petty ass will forever and always choose to write about how misery loves company and that I’m saving you a seat.✨Overview:I was hopeful. I read the first 67% of this book super fast. I was t h r i l l e d that I was enjoying my time. I love to love books. I want to love books. It’s so much easier to love books. But I think looking back on that first two-thirds of the book, I was ignoring small and irritating things because I r e a l l y wanted to love this book. The relationship was cute, if surface level, and while the book was absolutely not rivals to lovers, I still liked the set up.But I was waiting for that spark to happen. That b i g revelation in the relationship when tensions are high and trust is fragile. The “I have a l w a y s loved you” painted bedroom or even the errant vasectomy (iykyk) big reveal. Something shocking or surprising or different.My kingdom for s o m e t h i n g.Anything. I really thought we’d get one. Instead I got a whole lotta Libby (main heroine’s sister), a weirdly placed Hallmark “Big City Person turned Small Town Person and Local Store Savior” moment, and book metaphors. So many book metaphors. (Thinking about it now, the “something” twist was here I guess…but it’s not regarding the romantic relationship so no dice and it wasn’t even interesting. It made a could be interesting plot point uninteresting.)✨Steam:I knew the last third of the book would feature their inevitable sex scene, but before we got to the Big Penetration Sensation, the moment that would wrap this book up with a bow, I was finally trapped by too many irritating things. They piled up to a height I couldn’t ignore; a height that cast a m o s t a g g r i e v e d shadow over the nice and tidy nothing special five-orgasms-in-one-sex-scene sex scene.Since I was already annoyed by the time we got to The Sex, the language was just way too flowery and metaphorical for me. I don’t care what the idea of Charlie feels like. Or just how much he resembles a book. I just want to know how he feels in your v a g i n a.The phrase “we fall into each other” made me want to gag. Just say you fucked goddamnit y’all are falling into each other all over the place! Ya topsyturvy mofos.I will say the sex was definitely more than I thought we’d get. There were three almost sex scenes prior to the Rolie Polie Olie fan fiction. The language went to the extent of “nipples” and “erection” but they did their jobs. The three prior scenes were each hot because the locales were super hot: front door, midnight pond, library. I think this is Emily’s hottest book. I would be fine with this sex/steam level in another book… with the one caveat that I actually like the rest of the book.✨Characters:Libby pushed me too far with her not being able to understand that Nora had a job and couldn’t just take three weeks off from work. Nora only worked until 5PM and took O N E phone call and Libby just had to puppy dog eye it. Nora was so self-sacrificial when it came to Libby. Yes I was annoyed at Libby, but goddamn girl take a hint and stop trying to help! She kept *covertly* throwing money at her sister it was weird. She gave up a lot of things and was about to do it again! She got some huge news and was like “but I’m so selfish for even wanting this during Libby’s midlife Hallmark crisis.” And when Nora finally got to lay into Libby, we were interrupted in such an eye roll way. Literally for fuck’s sake. It was my Rocky montage cut short by an untied shoelace and a face-plant into a bunch of stairs.I thought Charlie was pretty okay until he took a stab on the now communal blade of self-sacrifice. Out of nowhere, and only for the sake of previously non-existent tension, ol Chuck just had to fuck up his entire life for zero reasons. Nobody asked you for this rite of stoically unhappy passage sir. It was too much.This book was supposed to be a bloodthirsty shark and her grunting, broody nemesis. We got a minnow and a dude in a hoodie.She wasn’t really frigid, icy, or unfeeling at all. He wasn’t Roy Kent. He wore black once and I grunted more than he did. They had one semi-bad lunch two years ago that apparently made them rivals (it didn’t).I get that “underneath it all” she wasn’t supposed to be frigid or icy, but literally her exterior was just as nice and normal as her lukewarm inner self.✨Plot:He was an editor; she was an agent. He rejected a book (about an old man’s dog dying, fun!) she pitched. Two years pass and now that profound dog death book is a best seller. Her sister is having a Moment and wants to travel to the real town of this—thankfully—fictional dog death book. A book described as if that Sarah Machlaclan commercial just ended with a basket of dead puppies. The agent finds the editor is also in the obscure small town, a big *shock.*She shows him the die-puppy-die author’s most recent manuscript and it’s so good! brilliant! fucking amazing! perfect! for no reason at all because it’s frankly quite bad!(You really don’t get any actual details to turn the idea of that manuscript into a plot that makes sense so… gotta trust their Midas touches there I guess.)Since the author is *fragile,* frigid shark lady (?) must make sure the mean stormcloud dude (?) isn’t too mean. Yes the shark is actually being nice because she’s literally a nice person who rides a Peloton because she likes it. She was nothing at all like Margaret Tate—I love Margaret Tate. There’s nothing beneath the surface of either of the main characters, at least nothing intriguing. You get the basic plot points that check off the basic plot point list (including a great love for lists!). Her peloton is shoved so far down your throat you’re basically training for the Tour de France. The author seemed to think that owning a Peloton is the hallmark of a bitchy person so if she just! keeps! mentioning! pelofuckington! we’ll have to start to believe Nora is an unfeeling ice cube with thighs of steel.Of course, it’s really supposed to show us that nice people can be blonde and ride Pelotons too, but it was just… poorly done.I thought the concept was fun at the beginning: Nora is the Big City girlfriend that the Big City boyfriend in a Hallmark movie dumps for the Small Town baker/Christmas tree farm heiress/struggling bed and breakfast owner because the Big City girlfriend is too blonde and too toned from the stationary bike she wants to fuck more than him. Cool but just so… not about that at all? How can that character be so boring??? Nora never proved to me that she had ever been a poisonous bitch worthy of Bob Spaulding’s scorn. Although she did declare herself “Heathcliff”…but I also think she likes Heathcliff…so back to square one.✨Conclusion:By trying to subvert so many tropes, this book just reverted back to every other trope.Congratulations ya played yourself. I think parts were definitely meant to be tropey, butI don’t think the book really meant to be so wholly predictable and unsurprising.There was nothing about this book that would make me pick it up again or anything that makes it stand out from the crowd. The relationship was so…blah by the end. Maybe I’m the frigid wench because I felt nothing akin to warm and fuzzy.Again, I liked this book for a lot of the book, but that was basically allhinged on the assumption that the relationship would go somewhere interesting and I’d be naming him the honorary mayor of my vagina.Once it was clear I wasn’t going to let Charles anywhere near a large pair of ceremonial scissors, the shiny, bright ribbon fell away and I was pissed. All the small annoying things just snowballed into Heat Miser territory and I literally broke into a musical number. So sorry family.That emotional and romantic payoff ending (and the big “I love you” “prove it” scene) was sacrificed for pages and pages of Libby and her bookstore charity case.The relationship got like the last two pages. Of course, more than a few pages were devoted to their “gut-wrenching” but oh so “righteous” split up. I initially said this was Emily Henry’s most romancey romance but I take it back. It ended up being way more about Nora and Libby than about Nora and Charlie. It is evident in the scope of the ending.Just go watch The Proposal instead.⭐️⭐️.5/5 🌶🌶.75/5Spoilerish idfk: P.S. Really, when a character hasn’t cried for over a decade, there are certain expectations in a romance. Just saying. You don’t wait the whole book to cry and then cry over something other than the penis attached to the love of your life. You don’t make it your entire character trait and then wait until cry number four to cry over him. Ya just don’t.*Thank you to the publisher for an advanced review copy!

This is the part I should say “but I hope you love the book!” But my previously established petty ass will forever and always choose to write about how misery loves company and that I’m saving you a seat.✨Overview:I was hopeful. I read the first 67% of this book super fast. I was t h r i l l e d that I was enjoying my time. I love to love books. I want to love books. It’s so much easier to love books. But I think looking back on that first two-thirds of the book, I was ignoring small and irritating things because I r e a l l y wanted to love this book. The relationship was cute, if surface level, and while the book was absolutely not rivals to lovers, I still liked the set up.But I was waiting for that spark to happen. That b i g revelation in the relationship when tensions are high and trust is fragile. The “I have a l w a y s loved you” painted bedroom or even the errant vasectomy (iykyk) big reveal. Something shocking or surprising or different.My kingdom for s o m e t h i n g.Anything. I really thought we’d get one. Instead I got a whole lotta Libby (main heroine’s sister), a weirdly placed Hallmark “Big City Person turned Small Town Person and Local Store Savior” moment, and book metaphors. So many book metaphors. (Thinking about it now, the “something” twist was here I guess…but it’s not regarding the romantic relationship so no dice and it wasn’t even interesting. It made a could be interesting plot point uninteresting.)✨Steam:I knew the last third of the book would feature their inevitable sex scene, but before we got to the Big Penetration Sensation, the moment that would wrap this book up with a bow, I was finally trapped by too many irritating things. They piled up to a height I couldn’t ignore; a height that cast a m o s t a g g r i e v e d shadow over the nice and tidy nothing special five-orgasms-in-one-sex-scene sex scene.Since I was already annoyed by the time we got to The Sex, the language was just way too flowery and metaphorical for me. I don’t care what the idea of Charlie feels like. Or just how much he resembles a book. I just want to know how he feels in your v a g i n a.The phrase “we fall into each other” made me want to gag. Just say you fucked goddamnit y’all are falling into each other all over the place! Ya topsyturvy mofos.I will say the sex was definitely more than I thought we’d get. There were three almost sex scenes prior to the Rolie Polie Olie fan fiction. The language went to the extent of “nipples” and “erection” but they did their jobs. The three prior scenes were each hot because the locales were super hot: front door, midnight pond, library. I think this is Emily’s hottest book. I would be fine with this sex/steam level in another book… with the one caveat that I actually like the rest of the book.✨Characters:Libby pushed me too far with her not being able to understand that Nora had a job and couldn’t just take three weeks off from work. Nora only worked until 5PM and took O N E phone call and Libby just had to puppy dog eye it. Nora was so self-sacrificial when it came to Libby. Yes I was annoyed at Libby, but goddamn girl take a hint and stop trying to help! She kept *covertly* throwing money at her sister it was weird. She gave up a lot of things and was about to do it again! She got some huge news and was like “but I’m so selfish for even wanting this during Libby’s midlife Hallmark crisis.” And when Nora finally got to lay into Libby, we were interrupted in such an eye roll way. Literally for fuck’s sake. It was my Rocky montage cut short by an untied shoelace and a face-plant into a bunch of stairs.I thought Charlie was pretty okay until he took a stab on the now communal blade of self-sacrifice. Out of nowhere, and only for the sake of previously non-existent tension, ol Chuck just had to fuck up his entire life for zero reasons. Nobody asked you for this rite of stoically unhappy passage sir. It was too much.This book was supposed to be a bloodthirsty shark and her grunting, broody nemesis. We got a minnow and a dude in a hoodie.She wasn’t really frigid, icy, or unfeeling at all. He wasn’t Roy Kent. He wore black once and I grunted more than he did. They had one semi-bad lunch two years ago that apparently made them rivals (it didn’t).I get that “underneath it all” she wasn’t supposed to be frigid or icy, but literally her exterior was just as nice and normal as her lukewarm inner self.✨Plot:He was an editor; she was an agent. He rejected a book (about an old man’s dog dying, fun!) she pitched. Two years pass and now that profound dog death book is a best seller. Her sister is having a Moment and wants to travel to the real town of this—thankfully—fictional dog death book. A book described as if that Sarah Machlaclan commercial just ended with a basket of dead puppies. The agent finds the editor is also in the obscure small town, a big *shock.*She shows him the die-puppy-die author’s most recent manuscript and it’s so good! brilliant! fucking amazing! perfect! for no reason at all because it’s frankly quite bad!(You really don’t get any actual details to turn the idea of that manuscript into a plot that makes sense so… gotta trust their Midas touches there I guess.)Since the author is *fragile,* frigid shark lady (?) must make sure the mean stormcloud dude (?) isn’t too mean. Yes the shark is actually being nice because she’s literally a nice person who rides a Peloton because she likes it. She was nothing at all like Margaret Tate—I love Margaret Tate. There’s nothing beneath the surface of either of the main characters, at least nothing intriguing. You get the basic plot points that check off the basic plot point list (including a great love for lists!). Her peloton is shoved so far down your throat you’re basically training for the Tour de France. The author seemed to think that owning a Peloton is the hallmark of a bitchy person so if she just! keeps! mentioning! pelofuckington! we’ll have to start to believe Nora is an unfeeling ice cube with thighs of steel.Of course, it’s really supposed to show us that nice people can be blonde and ride Pelotons too, but it was just… poorly done.I thought the concept was fun at the beginning: Nora is the Big City girlfriend that the Big City boyfriend in a Hallmark movie dumps for the Small Town baker/Christmas tree farm heiress/struggling bed and breakfast owner because the Big City girlfriend is too blonde and too toned from the stationary bike she wants to fuck more than him. Cool but just so… not about that at all? How can that character be so boring??? Nora never proved to me that she had ever been a poisonous bitch worthy of Bob Spaulding’s scorn. Although she did declare herself “Heathcliff”…but I also think she likes Heathcliff…so back to square one.✨Conclusion:By trying to subvert so many tropes, this book just reverted back to every other trope.Congratulations ya played yourself. I think parts were definitely meant to be tropey, butI don’t think the book really meant to be so wholly predictable and unsurprising.There was nothing about this book that would make me pick it up again or anything that makes it stand out from the crowd. The relationship was so…blah by the end. Maybe I’m the frigid wench because I felt nothing akin to warm and fuzzy.Again, I liked this book for a lot of the book, but that was basically allhinged on the assumption that the relationship would go somewhere interesting and I’d be naming him the honorary mayor of my vagina.Once it was clear I wasn’t going to let Charles anywhere near a large pair of ceremonial scissors, the shiny, bright ribbon fell away and I was pissed. All the small annoying things just snowballed into Heat Miser territory and I literally broke into a musical number. So sorry family.That emotional and romantic payoff ending (and the big “I love you” “prove it” scene) was sacrificed for pages and pages of Libby and her bookstore charity case.The relationship got like the last two pages. Of course, more than a few pages were devoted to their “gut-wrenching” but oh so “righteous” split up. I initially said this was Emily Henry’s most romancey romance but I take it back. It ended up being way more about Nora and Libby than about Nora and Charlie. It is evident in the scope of the ending.Just go watch The Proposal instead.⭐️⭐️.5/5 🌶🌶.75/5Spoilerish idfk: P.S. Really, when a character hasn’t cried for over a decade, there are certain expectations in a romance. Just saying. You don’t wait the whole book to cry and then cry over something other than the penis attached to the love of your life. You don’t make it your entire character trait and then wait until cry number four to cry over him. Ya just don’t.*Thank you to the publisher for an advanced review copy! I really thought we had one bois I really did. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: All ten of the stories in this anthology are depressing, macabre and grotesque. Their strength lies in their vivid description of life in the South for the many poor, uneducated and disadvantaged.Flannery O’Connor (1925-1964) writes in the Southern Gothic Style. Disabilities, sanity, race, religion and social inequalities are scrutinized in a cold detached manner. Not a pinch of sentimentality is to be found. Her writing is remarkably vivid. First published in 1953, the collection opens a window on life in the South during the first half of the 20th century. One can draw parallels with life there todayI did not “enjoy” reading this. I found it excruciatingly difficult, but I feel this was O’Connor’s intention. Shemeantto shake her readers, and she does. I am glad I read the stories, but I will not be picking up more. I understand d her message and this is enough.Below, each of the stories are reviewed in the order they appear in the book. Read THE ARTIFICIAL NIGGER first. I think it is the best. If you cannot stomach this, do not even try the rest. It is the only one with a pinch, mind you only a pinch, of something good that lifts you above the gloom of the rest. I recommend reading them with an interval of several days between each.A GOOD MAN IS HARD TO FIND(1 star)Horrible, but realistic. The “Misfit”, a dangerous criminal,killsa family of six traveling in their car. Each iskilledone by one. Gruesome and violent and what is the message?THE RIVER(1 star)A little boy of 4 or 5 years is taken by his babysitter, Mrs. Cronin, to a preacher who is to wash away the child’s pain in the river, the “River of Life, of God and of God’s Blood”. The preacher is to pray for the child’s “sick” mother too, in reality, she has only a hangover. He is baptized, but has said his name is Bevel. This is not true; his being the name of the preacher! The boy walks the next day alone to the river and tries to baptize himself, buthe drowns.Again, I do not understand the message. Does God help or doesn’t he? Is it a blessing that the boyis released from his awful existence?THE LIFE YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN(1 star)A disabled, poor tramp stops at a house where a widowed old lady and her retarded daughter live. The mother encourages the tramp to marry her daughter and live with them, and so help in repairing the house and doing chores. She givesthem money for a honeymoon. He takes off in the woman’s repaired car, leaves the daughter along the way and drives off to Mobile, Alabama. Again, this says nothing to me.A STROKE OF GOOD FORTUNE(2 stars)An exhausted woman Is attempting to pull herself up flights and flights of stairs. At each landing she talks with the tenant there—a teacher, a secretary, to a chiropractor who tells hershe is pregnant. The trip up the stairs is excruciatingly long and difficult. She realizesshe is probably pregnant, which she does not want to be! I just wanted the story to end. I was glad we did not have to get to the top of the stairs. Her misery was palpable, but what was the story’s point other than to describe the plight of a distraught, struggling and suffering woman?! I felt her pain, but do not like the story. I appreciate the writing though.A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST(3 stars)Two 14-year-old girls at a convent spend the weekend at the house of their 12-year-old second cousin. The two girls are in their young teens and all they think about is boys and the mystery of sex. The younger child is curious too. The older girls go to a fair and tell the younger what they saw—a human being that was both woman and man. The girls go back to school and we are told the fair was closed down. What the story does well is draw young adolescent girls’ queries about “the facts of life” in a convent setting. Their ideas are confused and jumbled up with religious explanations. Adults do not explain sex in clear text. The details vividly capture how adolescents try to make sense of what no one explains. What is described may be accurate, butas with all the stories so far, absolutely none of the characters are appealing. Should the world be described consistently in such dark tones?!THE ARTIFICIAL NIGGER(5 stars)Finally, a story that I thought was really great. It is about a grandfather and grandson that take a train ride into Atlanta. They are poor, uneducated Whites. The description of both the train ride and what they experienced in Atlanta is magnificent. The two get lost in the black part of town. They are frightened and so are we. Heart-pounding. we watch as the grandfather, in a horrible manner, lets the grandson down. Despair is drawn in the “artificial nigger” statue of the story, the statue of the title, and in the lives ofbothBlacks and Whites. It is in this story that O’Connor grabs and holds the reader best, emotionally pulling the reader in. Morals, ethics and religion can do overlap well in this story. There is an emotional pull in this story that is missing in the othersand, for once, there is a positive element to the story. Taking the trip into town brought about something good.They were now both happy to live where they did.Thank goodness I did not give up on the stories too soon! Now, for the first time, I look forward to the stories that lie ahead.A CIRCLE IN THE FIRE(With distance from the story, I am willing to give it 3 stars.)Three teenage boys visit Mrs. Cope, her daughter and Mrs. Pritchard, who works for her. One of the boys had lived there as a child. The atmosphere is dark and threatening. The boys are in control; the women cannot make them leave. Mrs. Pritchard regales in calamitous stories. Mrs. Cope copes by stressing all one has to be thankful for. The boysstart a fire and the reader understands that the house and property will burn. The tragedy of the story is that despite Mrs. Cope thankful words, we know she knows that her situation is dire. This is made evident in the description of how Mrs. Cope holds her body as the tale nears its end. Her very survival is dependent on the mercy of the three boys. There is not one chance in a hundred that the boys will show mercy. Mrs. Pritchard’s calamitous storiesarethe reality of these women’s lives. The tone of the story is menacing and frightening. The strength of the story lies in its depiction of life in the South.As in all of the stories, I struggled with the author’s unclear use of pronouns.A LATE ENCOUNTER WITH THE ENEMY(2 stars)A 62-year-old granddaughter and her 104-year-old grandfather are together at the granddaughter’s graduation ceremony. She is to finally get a graduation diploma. The grandfather is up on the stage in a wheel chair in his general’s uniform. His age has made him both mentally and physically disabled. The story is a mix of sad and funny—mostly sad in its depiction of an elderly person’s physical decrepitude and loss of sanity. Hediesup on the stage. The story may be accurate in its depiction, but certainly not pleasant. O’Connor focuses only on difficult situations. The delusional old man’s cracks about women may perhaps bring a smile to your face.The humor is not to my taste. At least the story was not as long and drawn out as the others.GOOD COUNTRY PEOPLE(1 star)Good country people are NOT “good country people” is the moral of this story. A so-called bible salesmanseducesa thirty -two-year-old, unloved spinster daughter with an artificial leg and no prospects for marriage. “That is life” and “Nothing is perfect” are the words said to convince one’s self that life without happiness, a life filled with degradation and loneliness, without human dignity or goodness, is not so bad. This story draws the worst in man to an extreme.The story is way too long, as so many of the others have been.THE DISPLACED PERSON(1 star)The displaced person in this story is a Pole. He has survived life in a concentration camp. He is diligent and hard working. This is why Blacks and the poor White despise him. At the end, the Blacks, the white workers and the farm ownerlet a tractor run over the displaced person, allowing him to be killed!! He has disturbed life’s equilibrium. The employeesleave, the woman becomes sick and the priest is the only one who visits. The message? Foreigners are never liked because they are different. The story is depressing and too long.A free online link is found at Gutenberg:http://www.boyd.k12.ky.us/userfiles/4..., error: All ten of the stories in this anthology are depressing, macabre and grotesque.

            "Translation failed for: Dark Horse tries to do three different things but fails to do any of them well. It tries to be a sci-fi romance, an alien abduction story, and a space opera all in one. Throw in a slow pace and an underwhelming protagonist and you get a book that just doesn't deliver much on the interesting premise.Rose McKenzie finds herself prisoner on an alien warship after being abducted from Earth. With the help of a self-aware AI, she breaks free of her prison and lands on a remote planet waiting for a nearby peaceful alien race, known as the Grih, to help her. Captain Dav Jallan is the Grih officer who finds her on the remote planet and is almost instantly taken by the universally sexy Rose. As it turns out, humans and Grih are very similar in appearance and sexually compatible (odd coincidence huh?). Unfortunately the Grih are terrified of AI and would kill her friend if they knew he was helping her. Rose must lie to protect Sazo, her AI friend, but she finds herself in the middle of an interstellar incident that could start a war.Of the three subplots, the love story is the one that made its way on to the page the most often. Rose finds herself enthralled with the tall, strong, handsome and elven Captain Jallan, not giving a moments thought to the fact he's an alien. His appearance is described as humanoid with the exception of the pointy ears and greater height. Tall, dark and handsome shows up to save the helpless young blonde, carrying her away from danger in his big strong arms.Why is Dav attracted to Rose? Well she's a small, surprisingly intelligent woman with large breasts and an amazing singing voice. By intelligence I mean she is modern and not from a primitive race of stone age cave people.Dav comments countless times on Rose's short stature, great curves, and her voice (I thought modern men weren't supposed to focus on these superficial things). By comparison, Grih women are taller, thinner, and can't sing at all. There is very little emphasis on personality, chemistry, or the potential to help one another grow as people. This is more akin to a late night Cinemax movie than a modern love story. The romance develops very slowly and is interrupted with the other major events taking place in the story. There is limited chemistry between the two would-be lovers, unless you count Rose's constant need for a rescuer. She is placed in mortal danger several times, giving Dav plenty of opportunities to demonstrate is potent manhood.The author is also a bit shameless in titillating the reader. Rose takes about ten showers during the book and in one scene goes for a swim in an oversized bathing suit that keeps slipping off. There were moments I was sure the author had to be a guy. The author keeps drawing attention to Rose's body. To her credit, Rose never intentionally uses Dav's infatuation with her to her advantage.As an alien abduction story, Dark Horse skips over the abduction itself. The novel begins with Rose mostly adjusted to her situation, and has even learned several alien languages when the story begins. Thoughts of Earth rarely come up. Her entire character is built upon her three month ordeal on the alien vessel and the drama that happens afterward. It is as if she never lived on Earth.The space opera portion drives a lot of the second half. The powers that be know Rose is keeping a secret, the one that would explain how she escaped captivity. That secret is her AI friend Sazo. Unfortunately the slow pace and weak world-building saps a lot of the strength from this part of the story. In general, there is very little tension in this novel. Everyone is so damn calm, polite, and reasonable with one another. The aliens apologize to Rose countless times for various insults, actual or perceived. Despite the intense military situation, it feels like everyone is on valium.Finally, the novel could've used another round of revisions to fix a few issues. The prose is solid for the most part, but there are a few mistakes and a lack of description in places where it could've helped a lot. Another troubling but minor issue is the title itself. The author uses Dark Horse as a term that describes an unknown factor in a complex situation. That is not its common usage in the US. A dark horse is a competitor that is not considered a likely contender but rises to surprise the odds makers. Rose is not a competitor, nor is there any real horse race taking place. There are also a couple contradictions in the dialogue and story an editor should've caught.There were chapters that got me hooked for a while and some clever twists towards the end. The cultural differences between Grih and human were also interesting at times as well. The prose was pretty solid but again, could've used one more round of edits and revisions.I think if the author could've decided on one type of story instead of trying to write three, Dark Horse could've been much better. To make such a complex story, a lot more research and work was needed to make it connect, in my opinion., error: Dark Horse tries to do three different things but fails to do any of them well. It tries to be a sci-fi romance, an alien abduction story, and a space opera all in one.

It is as if she never lived on Earth.The space opera portion drives a lot of the second half. The powers that be know Rose is keeping a secret, the one that would explain how she escaped captivity. That secret is her AI friend Sazo. Unfortunately the slow pace and weak world-building saps a lot of the strength from this part of the story. In general, there is very little tension in this novel. Everyone is so damn calm, polite, and reasonable with one another. The aliens apologize to Rose countless times for various insults, actual or perceived. Despite the intense military situation, it feels like everyone is on valium.Finally, the novel could've used another round of revisions to fix a few issues. The prose is solid for the most part, but there are a few mistakes and a lack of description in places where it could've helped a lot. Another troubling but minor issue is the title itself. The author uses Dark Horse as a term that describes an unknown factor in a complex situation. That is not its common usage in the US. A dark horse is a competitor that is not considered a likely contender but rises to surprise the odds makers. Rose is not a competitor, nor is there any real horse race taking place. There are also a couple contradictions in the dialogue and story an editor should've caught.There were chapters that got me hooked for a while and some clever twists towards the end. The cultural differences between Grih and human were also interesting at times as well. The prose was pretty solid but again, could've used one more round of edits and revisions.I think if the author could've decided on one type of story instead of trying to write three, Dark Horse could've been much better. To make such a complex story, a lot more research and work was needed to make it connect, in my opinion. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: I will forego my usual rant about the original cover art. It's still bad. Just inside is a lovely touch: Jordan’s signature printed on the title page. That got me right in the feels.Everyone knows this book's history: Jordan wrote eleven books in the series, then got a fatal diagnosis and died before completing another book. He left behind materials and his widow-editor askedBrandon Sandersonto finish the series. Brando Sando did a respectable job of this.The problem for me is the preceding seven to eleven books. Books 5 through 11 in particular are terrible. Some of this I only fully grasped in retrospect; nostalgia and anticipation for certain major events blinded me for a time. The series has a lot of issues, but the most significant for me here is that Jordan clearly didn't know how to structure a series like this one. The pacing is horrific; no book in that sequence has a distinct plot arc; and multiple recurring annoyances pile up. Book 10 in particular broke me so badly that book 11, ostensibly the \"slump-breaker\", could do nothing to soothe my irritation at the entire series.I've read it all before so none of this should come as a surprise, but this is my first time doing a straight full-series read-through (I started January 2021 at a book per month, with one month off for mourning after book 11) and it has really put it all together for me. So, I'm coming into this, Bundo Sundo's first foray into continuing the epic in Jordan's honor, and although it was the best Wheel of Time book in well over a decade, it only served to highlight all the failures of the preceding books.Let's be honest; is there any way that if Jordan had remained in good health, the series would have wrapped up in just three more books? Impossible, given the evidence of his last seven books and twelve years, which show no evidence that he knew how to plot or pace such events. Based on the fact he thought what he left behind could be done in just one final volume, I believe only the imminence of death provided any impetus to remotely wrap things up for the endgame. At this point, I am convinced that he received zero structural editing after the first few books. Why would his editor/wife, whose job this would typically be, make any demands for change? Each book kept selling like hotcakes, even well past their best-before date. Even with some percentage of drop-offs from those wise souls able to read the series critically and abandon ship before the end, there were still millions of book buyers ready to continue eating up each new volume, no matter how little the series progressed. I regret that I have low ability to bail on a series once I am several books in. For this current re-read, I'm still all in, because my mama didn't raise no part-timer. Plus, I've never had the experience of this series in a single run. I'm seeing it through, rage-reading to the end.Thankfully for the rest of my re-read, this book finally moves the series forward, but this just irritates me more. There's no way to win; excellent plot progression here just reinforces how poor it was before. Significant character development and exploring motivations that hearken back to the series' early books, makes me say, \"Why didn't Jordan do this so long ago?\". It doesn't matter how good this one book might be; it doesn't correct the horrible failures of the past books. \"At least it's moving forward now,\" is not a balm, because it should have been doing that a long, long time ago. Every malingering plot thread that got picked up, many from five or more books ago, simply begged why it was abandoned for so long that any potential interest was long lost. I am so mad at the series up until now, there was simply nothing Brashy Slashy could do to erase all of that ill will. Maybe, just maybe, I will feel a little better by the Last Battle.In his foreword, Sanderson states that he did not try to emulate Jordan's style. He didn't; in many places, it doesn't sound like Jordan's prose, though it retained all the hallmarks of the series. I lack the vocabulary or level of analysis to describe the differences well, but my impression was that Sanderson's prose was generally a little simpler, with shorter sentences and less flowery description. One major and welcome difference was to shift stories with each chapter, as opposed to Jordan’s style of sticking with one subject for a clump of chapters. This gave the book a dynamism that its predecessors lacks.Characters still communicate in sniffs and braid tugs, as they should. To change that now would be to change their essences. Dialogue was mostly similar to Jordan's; Sanderson got the characters' voices mostly right, with Mat being a notable exception. It's not that Mat was unrecognizable; he was just maybe more Mat-y than usual, too over the top. His extended rant about women in his first appearance went a little overboard, and attempts at using Mat for comedy were amusing but weird, in particular Mat's obsession with \"elaborate aliases and backstories\" for a town infiltration plan. Some scenes seemed invented out of whole cloth, and these struck me as straight Sanderson struggling, only sometimes, to match Jordan's feel, if not his prose. One in particular that stood out as awkward for me involved Cadsuane visiting an inn run by a very particular innkeeper; the scene was inconsequential, and just felt weird and out of place for the WoT setting, like Sanderson didn't get that texture quite right. This is fine, just a comment.Unfortunately, Sandersondidemulate Jordan in continuing multiple annoyances. Passages that re-dump past events are necessary to an extent for many readers, especially given how many years this series ran for (and for the smart readers who never bothered to re-read when a new series entry came out), but Jordan did this so much before that it irked me each time. And then there's the style sheet rehashing...Think of Chet Vanin. Without referring to the text, here's what I know about him: he's fat, he was the best horsethief around, and you'd never think he could ride a horse so well because he's so fat. How do I know all of this? Becauseall of these details were repeated every single time Vanin appeared in any of half a dozen books.Guess what information we get when he appears in this book.\"Vanin! Where on the Dark One's blistered backside are we?\"The fat former horsethief looked up.Got it. We re-established who he is. Moving on,Mat had never expected such an emotion from the overweight horsethief.Oh for heaven's sake. Are we done expressing how fat and horsethiefy Vanin is?They had advance scouts out, of course, but none of them were as good as Vanin. Despite his size, the man could sneak close enough to an enemy fortification to count the whiskers in the camp guards' beards.Got that all out of your system? Great, now we canVanin always looked so ridiculous, perched like a melon atop the back of his horse, his feet sticking out to the sides. But the man could ride, there was no doubting that.[deep breaths here it's okay we're okay] And of course Jordan couldn't let any character come back around without reminding the reader exactly how big or skinny they were. Like Verin Sedai, everyone's favorite mysterious Brown Ajah member. Do you remember whether she's plump? I do. She's plump. I have been told this many times. MANY. Let's check in on Verin here...There, sitting on a short-legged white mare, was a pudgy woman with a grandmotherly air . . .[Deep breaths again]. Let's move on. What else was annoying in Jordan's writing? Oh yeah, how about how every song played or sung in a tavern is stated to be known by different names in different places? We're not going back to that, are we?One of the nearby tables had a dice game going. Looked like Cat's Paw—or, at least, that's what it had been called the night Mat had first been taught it. They called it Third Gem in Ebou Dar, and he'd heard it called Feathers Aloft in Cairhien.Grr! Arrgh! At least Sanderson isn't going to repeat Jordan's often-lamented habit of specifying that any woman who crosses her arms does it \"beneath her breasts\", will he?The tall Aes Sedai . . . maintained a stern expression, arms folded beneath her breasts, . . .What the hell, man! I'm going to go ahead and copy-paste my own mid-book quote and comment on one of the rare occasions a male character crosses his arms, because frankly I was hilarious:Mandevwin and Talmanes were just inside the tent, the former standing with folded arms, the latter settling himself on the floor.But WHERE were his arms folded? How can I picture this scene if you don’t tell me if his arms were folded above, on, or below his nipples? WHAT DO FOLDED ARMS EVEN MEAN WITHOUT THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION??? If only he had breasts this could be made so much clearer.So all of that and more kept me severely irritated for the bulk of this book. Really, Sanderson did a phenomal, loving job, adding a lot of depth to character motivations, linkages to long-ago (in reader time) events, and truly honoring the series. In fairness, the last 180 pages were some of the very best in the whole series, with only a couple of small lulls. I admit to tearing up at one two points.

Between two riders! NOT between the horse and it's rider though. Well... sometimes between the horse and it's rider. Just a little.When this book started, it felt like a breath of fresh sea air, not rife with the smell of YA cliche. That was mainly because Ithoughtthis book was told from the alternating perspective of twoboys, Sean and Puck, which would have been a nice change for Steifvater. Maybe I was in the mood for a buddy story or a brother story, instead of the usual stereotypical romance. But it wasn't meant to be, you see, because Puck is a SHE and not a he. (Sorry, my inner Dr Suess came out for a second.)Not that this is a spoiler or anything, as it it mentioned fairly quickly. It was just something my mind was set against. I wanted Puck to be a boy. I'm tired of the \"here's a girl who does this and here's a boy who does that, hmmmm, I wonder when and how they'll meet and, gee, wouldn't it be weird if they fell in love, because, oh boy, we've never seen THAT happen before.\"The RundownI understand now why the blurb is so impossibly vague. This is a difficult book to sum up.Two individuals, Sean and Puck, are preparing separately for the annual Scorpio Races (where the dangerous water horses of Thisby face off against each other with their riders and generally lots of bloodshed) until their lives eventually collide into each other. Sean is the typical Thisby teen boy who just so happens to compete every year in the races. Puck is a young girl having some family issues, in particular with her brother's desire to leave the family home and the island that they live on, and she thinks that competing in the Races will force her brother to stick around. But Puck decides to race her regular horse against the blood-thirsty water horses, which cause quite a stir and tons of problems. And that's just the beginning.The Writing and World-BuildingIf there was one word to describe this book, it would definitely be \"atmospheric.\" The descriptionsweregorgeous, but the location for the book is more than a little mind boggling. It seems to be a created fantasy island located in Ireland? I think. The term they use for the water horses is a Gaelic term but it takes place on a fictional island, I guess? The specifics are never really laid out about where or what or when this \"Thisby\" is.Many reviewers raised concerns about the lack of world-building in the Maggie's Wolves of Mercy Falls series. That being said, I feel like she almost went in the opposite direction with way too much world-building, including tiny details about minor characters, and it honestly wasn't very interesting to me. The characters all had their own quirks and backgrounds, but we were told too much and too often about them. More than was necessary.However, the world that she built around The Scorpio Races was much better than the world of Mercy Falls. The prose isn't quite as purple and the romance isn't nearly as cheddar. I'd say it's more like a magenta colby jack. It was just a very bland and tasteless magenta colby jack.The PacingPacing was my biggest problem with The Scorpio Races. It takes at least 100 pages or so before anything remotely interesting happens. Usually by then, I would have put a book down not knowing whether or not I would pick it back up, but because this is an upcoming release, I felt like I needed to keep going. In addition, because of the way the environments are described and the action builds slowly, a certain intrigue simmers in your mind and drives you forward regardless of the slow start. But I'm not entirely sure that the pay-off was worth the anticipation.Around page 380, the seemingly fabled races begin. Now that would have been a great place to start the book! Because up until that point almost NOTHING had happened. It was all setup. I'm sorry, but I do notneedthree hundred and eighty pages ofsetup. Even if it has pretty words and HORSES!!!Because by the time that part finally came around and I thought, \"Now this could be interesting,\" -- it was much too late. I was looooong past mentally checked out and had become disinvested and disinterested.This might come off rude, but this is the best way I know how too explain what it seems like has happened.You know when a little girl first discovers the way her skirt twirls when she spins? It's cute, right?! You're like, \"Oh, isn't that precious. She's twirling.\" But then it'stwo weeks laterand she's STILL twirling like the world won't be able to turn itself if she stops, you're like \"Okay, we get it! You cantwirl\" But you can't say that because then you're just being an asshole for ruining a little girl's \"twirl time.\"Well, Maggie Steifvater can twirl... and whirl... and swirl... and canter... and whinny. It just seems like the author discovered for the first time \"Wow, I can write pretty prose. Let's throw some more of that in there.\"Don't get me wrong: Itispretty. But holy well of words, do we need SO much of it?The Scorpio Races don't actually happen until the last 20 or 30 pages of the book, and even then, the actual Races only last about 12 pages, the rest is aftermath. For a book that's 410 pages long, that is not a good chunk of the content. Only about 3 percent of it, in fact. Maybe it should have been titled \"The 380 pages leading up to the Scorpio races\".I mean, sure, Hunger Games had some setup as well. But it would have been an entirely different book had the Games only lasted 12 pages.Who Should or Should Not Read ItI wouldn't read this book again. And I wouldn't recommend it for a lot of people. But I think a lot of people will read it anyway.Here's why:1) It is written by Maggie Stiefvater.2) It is a paranormal written by Maggie Stiefvater.3) It is a paranormal written by Maggie Stiefvater about HORSES! HORSES! HORSES! HORSES! HORSES! HORSES!254) It is a standalone. (Finally!)If you hated Shiver, then you'll probably hate this one as well. If you loved Shiver, then you might love this one.Right around the time that the Black Beauty movie with Chris O'Donnell came out, I went through horse phase like many young girls probably do. But I got over it and I think I'm still over it, which might be why I didn't love this book. I also went through a dog phase, Old Yeller, Rin Tin Tin, Turner and Hooch, except that I never grew out of it and never will.I think Horse People will love this book. Keep in mind that there is a big difference betweenlikinghorses and being a Horse Person. Ilikehorses. They are pretty and I like to imagine them with horns or wings or gills, but my thoughts don't revolve around them. I am a Dog Person.I've heard people say that horses are like really big dogs, but I think that those people are just Horse People trying to convince you to be a Horse Person. When really, it's like comparing Chihuahuas to Labradors. Some people say that small dogs and big dogs are the same. They aren't. Not even close. Usually, those who say that are Small Dog People trying to convince you to be a Small Dog Person. This isn't to say that any of them are better or worse than the other, they are justdifferent. I am a Big Dog person, not a Horse Person, not a Small Dog Person.If this had been about magical sea-faring German Shepherds, I would have LOVED it.... probably.Other ThoughtsThe one thing I really like about what Maggie did with this book, though the same may not be said for Shiver, is that she didn't follow thepackwith The Scorpio Races. After the vampire-werewolf craze hit and SMeyer announced on her website that she was writing a mermaid book, strangely, we saw a surge in the number of mermaid based books on the market, many of a questionable quality due to the fact that they were most likely rushed onto the shelves. Maggie didn't go with the surge but she didn't go against it either. She went along side it by creating her own mythology similar to many ocean based tales. It wouldn't be surprising if we see a rise in ocean based mythology books after The Scorpio Races.Although the pacing is slower and the story not quite as involving as Shiver, this book still seems to be a step in a better direction (albeit almost too far a step) for Maggie. The world-building is much more fully realized and detailed than that of Shiver and the storyline isn't purely romance based, which leads me to think that maybe, justmaybe, authorsdopay attention to reviewers complaints. Maybe she just decided to put more time into her world-building on her own, or maybe, hopefully, we are having someminuscule effecton how the book world evolves. And that makes me very VERY happy.The VerdictThe Wolves of Mercy Falls was just a little too soft for me and the Scorpio Races was just a little too hard, so maybe by the time the next book comes around from Ms Stiefavter, that one will bejuuuuust rightfor this little goldilocks.I'm giving it two stars because it was written well, just badly paced and plotted, in my opinion. The pretty words weren't enough to make up for the boredom. And unfortunately, I never connected to the characters or the romance between them.The thing that frustrates me the most about books is when feel like I didn't learn anything. I don't really mind not being entertained if I take something away from it that I had never thought about before. But I at least want one or the other.If you aren't going to entertain me, then teach me something. If you aren't going to teach me something, then by George Washington, at least ENTERTAIN me!! I'm very sorry to say that this book did neither. But that isn't to say that you will feel the same.Personally, I didn't love it. I don't think I even liked it, but it wasn't terribly written; it wasn't too terribly involving either.Meh. That's my word for this book. Or rather more like -MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAH.Yeah, I just whinnied.

More than was necessary.However, the world that she built around The Scorpio Races was much better than the world of Mercy Falls. The prose isn't quite as purple and the romance isn't nearly as cheddar. I'd say it's more like a magenta colby jack. It was just a very bland and tasteless magenta colby jack.The PacingPacing was my biggest problem with The Scorpio Races. It takes at least 100 pages or so before anything remotely interesting happens. Usually by then, I would have put a book down not knowing whether or not I would pick it back up, but because this is an upcoming release, I felt like I needed to keep going. In addition, because of the way the environments are described and the action builds slowly, a certain intrigue simmers in your mind and drives you forward regardless of the slow start. But I'm not entirely sure that the pay-off was worth the anticipation.Around page 380, the seemingly fabled races begin. Now that would have been a great place to start the book! Because up until that point almost NOTHING had happened. It was all setup. I'm sorry, but I do notneedthree hundred and eighty pages ofsetup. Even if it has pretty words and HORSES!!!Because by the time that part finally came around and I thought, \"Now this could be interesting,\" -- it was much too late. I was looooong past mentally checked out and had become disinvested and disinterested.This might come off rude, but this is the best way I know how too explain what it seems like has happened.You know when a little girl first discovers the way her skirt twirls when she spins? It's cute, right?! You're like, \"Oh, isn't that precious. She's twirling.\" But then it'stwo weeks laterand she's STILL twirling like the world won't be able to turn itself if she stops, you're like \"Okay, we get it! You cantwirl\" But you can't say that because then you're just being an asshole for ruining a little girl's \"twirl time.\"Well, Maggie Steifvater can twirl... and whirl... and swirl... and canter... and whinny. It just seems like the author discovered for the first time \"Wow, I can write pretty prose. Let's throw some more of that in there.\"Don't get me wrong: Itispretty. But holy well of words, do we need SO much of it?The Scorpio Races don't actually happen until the last 20 or 30 pages of the book, and even then, the actual Races only last about 12 pages, the rest is aftermath. For a book that's 410 pages long, that is not a good chunk of the content. Only about 3 percent of it, in fact. Maybe it should have been titled \"The 380 pages leading up to the Scorpio races\".I mean, sure, Hunger Games had some setup as well. But it would have been an entirely different book had the Games only lasted 12 pages.Who Should or Should Not Read ItI wouldn't read this book again. And I wouldn't recommend it for a lot of people. But I think a lot of people will read it anyway.Here's why:1) It is written by Maggie Stiefvater.2) It is a paranormal written by Maggie Stiefvater.3) It is a paranormal written by Maggie Stiefvater about HORSES! HORSES! HORSES! HORSES! HORSES! HORSES!254) It is a standalone. (Finally!)If you hated Shiver, then you'll probably hate this one as well. If you loved Shiver, then you might love this one.Right around the time that the Black Beauty movie with Chris O'Donnell came out, I went through horse phase like many young girls probably do. But I got over it and I think I'm still over it, which might be why I didn't love this book. I also went through a dog phase, Old Yeller, Rin Tin Tin, Turner and Hooch, except that I never grew out of it and never will.I think Horse People will love this book. Keep in mind that there is a big difference betweenlikinghorses and being a Horse Person. Ilikehorses. They are pretty and I like to imagine them with horns or wings or gills, but my thoughts don't revolve around them. I am a Dog Person.I've heard people say that horses are like really big dogs, but I think that those people are just Horse People trying to convince you to be a Horse Person. When really, it's like comparing Chihuahuas to Labradors. Some people say that small dogs and big dogs are the same. They aren't. Not even close. Usually, those who say that are Small Dog People trying to convince you to be a Small Dog Person. This isn't to say that any of them are better or worse than the other, they are justdifferent. I am a Big Dog person, not a Horse Person, not a Small Dog Person.If this had been about magical sea-faring German Shepherds, I would have LOVED it.... probably.Other ThoughtsThe one thing I really like about what Maggie did with this book, though the same may not be said for Shiver, is that she didn't follow thepackwith The Scorpio Races. After the vampire-werewolf craze hit and SMeyer announced on her website that she was writing a mermaid book, strangely, we saw a surge in the number of mermaid based books on the market, many of a questionable quality due to the fact that they were most likely rushed onto the shelves. Maggie didn't go with the surge but she didn't go against it either. She went along side it by creating her own mythology similar to many ocean based tales. It wouldn't be surprising if we see a rise in ocean based mythology books after The Scorpio Races.Although the pacing is slower and the story not quite as involving as Shiver, this book still seems to be a step in a better direction (albeit almost too far a step) for Maggie. The world-building is much more fully realized and detailed than that of Shiver and the storyline isn't purely romance based, which leads me to think that maybe, justmaybe, authorsdopay attention to reviewers complaints. Maybe she just decided to put more time into her world-building on her own, or maybe, hopefully, we are having someminuscule effecton how the book world evolves. And that makes me very VERY happy.The VerdictThe Wolves of Mercy Falls was just a little too soft for me and the Scorpio Races was just a little too hard, so maybe by the time the next book comes around from Ms Stiefavter, that one will bejuuuuust rightfor this little goldilocks.I'm giving it two stars because it was written well, just badly paced and plotted, in my opinion. The pretty words weren't enough to make up for the boredom. And unfortunately, I never connected to the characters or the romance between them.The thing that frustrates me the most about books is when feel like I didn't learn anything. I don't really mind not being entertained if I take something away from it that I had never thought about before. But I at least want one or the other.If you aren't going to entertain me, then teach me something. If you aren't going to teach me something, then by George Washington, at least ENTERTAIN me!! I'm very sorry to say that this book did neither. But that isn't to say that you will feel the same.Personally, I didn't love it. I don't think I even liked it, but it wasn't terribly written; it wasn't too terribly involving either.Meh. That's my word for this book. Or rather more like -MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAH.Yeah, I just whinnied. Whatcha gonna do about it, huh? --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",
            "Translation failed for: This book was ok. I have read pretty much everything Picoult has written, and I'm also a massive history buff, so I looked to this book with very high hopes.Don't get me wrong, I liked this book - for reasons outlined by many of the other reviewers on this site. So for something a little different, I thought I would provide a few suggestions I would have made if I was Picoult's editor.This is because I've started to notice in the last few books there are gaping continuity errors that reveal bigger editing problems. This isn't surprising - as Picoult releases a book a year on a specific date, and this deadline must be met, and who would argue with a best-selling author?Things I would say if I was Picoult's editor:1. Go read Markus Zusack's \"The Book Thief.\"The Holocaust is a social scar that can go some way to healing, but should not be allowed to be covered up like Minka's long sleeves. But Holocaust stories need to either be meticulously researched (or you get people complaining about historical errors) or it has to be absolutely emotionally honest, which is why I suggest Zusack.This is because he is able to communicate the fear, uncertainty, moral reactions and other emotions his characters feel going through the events of the Second World War - but the key difference is that he does this by showing, not telling, the reader what his characters are feeling.It's actually quite common in your work to read passages where characters just tell the reader what they feel - rather than allowing the reader to interpret this through other means. Trust the reader, they're smart.2. Characters are very importantDon't even get me started on the name choices and awful character quirks (a guy who speaks solely in Haiku unimpeded by having to mentally count syllables or a fist to the face? Please.)Many of the characters needed more to them. This is something that kind of underpins a lot of my other suggestions - but for example, if Leo had experienced the effects of bullying (either victim, witness or perpetrator - at school or at home) this would have been a lot more engaging and explained his choice of career. Why would a nun leave a convent and then start a bakery?Nobody should be an \"extra\" - and while you don't need to have a total backstory for every single character, even the more central characters need more meat on their bones.3. When you start something, keep it going or just save it for another storyThere are a lot of ideas and plot opportunities go nowhere. Two examples are the grief counseling support group and the \"Jesus loaf\" that attracts thousands of pilgrims to the bakery. They just sort of....stop. Right at the very end Sage says something to the effect of \"Oh, the therapy group, remember, I used to do that. I haven't been for a while, but despite the possibility of self-harm nobody's thought to check up on me.\"I assumed these would play a much bigger role in the story, but obviously not.4. Sage's sisters - Rosemary and Thyme. Sorry, Salt n Pepper. What? Xanthum Gum and Baking Soda?Again, apart from the ridiculousness of the names, you have to either make them go the full Regan and Goneral - there was the perfect opportunity for them to openly and loudly reminisce about their parents' funeral later in the book - or make them more forgiving towards the end.Instead, you tell us they're mean and blame Sage for their parents' death - but once they find out she has a man, she's suddenly okay with them (and with you it seems. Because grief, moral quandaries and self-consciousness about facial scars are suddenly fine with some good old horizontal work.)5. Religious faith is more than eating some things and doing certain stuff when someone diesReligion is present throughout this story, but faith is noticeably absent. How would a teenage girl, incarcerated and facing death because of the world has turned against her religious faith, make peace with a God and a society that put her in this situation?6. Out of the rich smorgasbord of European and Jewish mythologies including death eaters, Golems, soul stealers and shape-shifters, you had to go the full Twilight with the Ania and Alecks story, didn't you?This is not the story a 1930/40s teenager facing the total and complete end of the world would write.This is the story a modern teenager who, like, is totally facing the end of the world because Mom says I'm not allowed to check my status until I've started my homework and she made peanut butter cookies when she knows choc chip are my favourite...would write.7. Let's just tear up these last five pages, shall we?In \"Keeping Faith\" the whole book was driven by the question of whether the little girl really was experiencing messianic abilities (such as stigmata) or if she was faking it all along.The ending was ambiguous, and it was wonderful. Book clubs all over the world talked late into the night and opened yet another bottle discussing this. It's made people go back and re-read the book. It made the book amazing and memorable.Likewise, this book was driven by two questions. One was whether Sage would do what Josef asks - and ending on her arrival at his house would have been fine. She has still gone through character development and thoroughly explored the consequences of her actions. It's fine to fade to black there.The second driving question was how both good and evil could co-exist in the same person. Morally ambiguous characters are interesting and cool - it's why Game of Thrones is so popular. (Well, that and boobs. Lots of boobs.)So this is not just why the ending made me very disappointed in you, young lady, but it's also why I think some of the other characters didn't feel very realistic. They were too good. Why couldn't Leo do something that would compromise his burgeoning relationship with Sage? Why couldn't Minka do something that would get someone else in trouble in the camp but benefit herself or her friend? What if Minka's father had done something bad?And this would incorporate the concept of the \"Storyteller\" into the book more thoroughly - the stories we tell ourselves to justify our actions. What stories does Sage tell herself to make it okay to knowingly sleep with a married man? What stories does Minka tell herself to assuage some of the guilt of being the survivor?So there you are, Jodi, take those suggestions away and work on your manuscript - it should turn out much better now...., error: This book was ok.

            "Translation failed for: It's my first Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie book for some reason. My only experience with Nigerian literature heretofore has beenThings Fall Apartwhich I've read multiple times and think exquisite. I had no notion of what to expect with this book, but I do know I was hoping for an idea of a modern Nigeria. I'm also always up for cultural clashes and the dynamics of race, so this was all set to be a fantastic experience.Obviously, that didn't happen and for the most part, this book is a disappointment for me. First, the thing that I did like about it - the observations on the still prevalent racism in America. Perhaps exaggerated for effect, it still resonates. It would have been a much better novel for me had it solely concentrated on Ifem's blog articles on Raceteenth. I understood the alienation Ifem felt when she first encountered the question of race (since it didn't exist in Nigeria), and how alone she felt when she got back to her country, both her and her country not the same as when she left it. It was mostly academical, since my longing for my country is not as much as my longing for family, but I did understand. I felt most for Ifem's confused cousin Dike, a Nigerian child who migrated to the US really early in life, who doesn't really know what he is. He has issues, and I do wish they were dealt with in a better, more Nigerian (as in more open) fashion, and we could see, if not a resolution, at least a better understanding of what he felt.The multiple issues (race, economy, alienation, bloodymindedness) is also partly my problem with the book. It's done well, almost too well, to the extent that plot and character development is compromised. When there is a chapter left in the book and a major issue to resolve, we meet a whole hoard of new people with the express purpose of discussing some random problems with Nigerian economy that we've neither heard before nor will we hear again. Had this been solely a commentary or an essay this would be acceptable, but it's not. It's a novel where we are supposed to care for the star crossed lovers - Ifemelu and Obinze - who are divided by time, oceans, marriage etc. Or at least we're supposed to care for Ifem (we see Obinze only rarely in this ~500 pages long book), and it's hard when her issues are unceremoniously swept under the carpet of the election chances of Barack Obama. This is a plot point.I'm not upset that the characters Adichie made up are flawed. But I am upset that their flaws are not given a context other than race. Ifem had issues that were not dealt with, issues that marred her every serious relationship. Especially the ones with the two Americans, one white and one black, each of which she broke and couldn't even understand what her fault was and why they wouldn't forgive her. But when it comes to explaining those relationships later, Adichie makes out that it was a discontent Ifem felt that was all about race. It was not - she cheated and she lied. She cheated for a silly reason that she was curious about another man's sexual prowess, and she lied about something that wasn't important to her but was extremely important to her other half. It bothered me that in the second instance her other half, Blaine, would make the immediate argument,Oh you would've done differently had you been an American black, when he's never before showed an inclination to do so, thus giving her bewilderment about his anger a justification, when realistically the argument between sparring couples would have beenYou knew how important this was to me and you didn't do it. But the worst was that you lied to me.And not only do they not work this out, but enter Obama and the problem is gone. Until she decides to walk out on him anyway becauseherfeelings forhimhas changed since the fight.Ifem learns nothing. She holds herself above everything, an observer with more than a little self righteousness. She's also a hypocritical person, and quite shallow. When a co-worker points out to her, accurately, that she's a judgmental bitch who tries to make the whole paper she works for about herself, her pat response is,You need to get yourself a moisturizer and stop scaring people with that nasty red lipstick. And no, her coworker, who talks inteenage American, didn't call her out on physical appearance. This immaturity is all over her relationships. Her problems with her parents when they come to visit, and she sneers at them because they're provincial and not chic enough for America. Her prolonged (and disrespectful) silence with the supposed love of her life Obinze, when it was her problem that drove that distance between them, and her expectation that the man would come crawling back when she was finally ready. Her nasty treatment of everything that doesn't agree with her basically. Nothing is addressed, and ultimately no matter how well it's written, commentary on race, no matter how piercing or accurate it is, does not a good novel make, if there's some idiot with negligible emotional growth through the book spouting it.The final nail in the coffin is the end, that starry eyed resolution for the two lovers with the magical love. I agree with Obinze's poor wife -Do you think you can just destroy this family because your old girlfriend came into town? Because you have had acrobatic sex that reminded you of your time in university?\"- lust was all I got from their affair, at least from Ifem. Obinze cares more for her than she does for him, and I really don't think it would be long before Ifem starts to get bored with poor Obinze. So much for love. I really, really wish I could have liked this book better.Edit: On the subject of books Adichie writes some of the most uncomfortable exchanges (for me). One, I find it weird that the one non African, black or otherwise, who discusses books with Ifem, toutsA Bend in the Riveras the Great African Novel. I must be in the wrong crowd, because I can think of any number of people pointing toThings Fall Apartas that, without even knowing the title of Sir Vidia's book. In any case, for a person who sneers at other people assuming that a book can only be about one thing, Ifem is remarkably certain about her reading ofA Bendbeing the only right one. Why can't it be about both, Ifem? Why can't it both be a love letter to colonialism as well as a book about the Indian Muslim character's isolation in a country not his? I mean, only because Ifem, a native African, was not aware of race and otherness before she stepped onto US soil, it doesn't mean an outsider wasn't persecuted within Africa. Furthermore, how is Ifem any different from the liberal Americans she lightly roasts in her blog? The ones who can crib unendingly about their country but cannot take even a slight slander of it from an outsider? Far be it from me to defendA Bend, it's been years since I read it, and I found it boring when I did, I found that exchange leaving a bad taste in my mouth, especially since a whole half of Americanah itself is given over to characters lusting after Europe and America.Second, why should slavery be a part of ordinary conversation, when Adichie propounds against it as a topic of novels? I honestly can't remember the mouthpiece she uses for this view, there are too many characters with only one opinion to contribute to the book. Anyway, it's something that happened in the 1960s and white guilt should not be absolved so quickly, yet writing about it is somehow selling out? I don't understand how saying this is any different than white people saying slavery is so done?Third, I found it ironic that one of the characters cries about how all the content in her book must be watered down for the non Black audience so that it's not all about race. Americanah is all about race (which is its strength, mostly), even when it has no reasonable cause to be. How could Adichie write this particular dialogue when it's untrue in the case of her own novel? Or is she immune because she's a literary big-shot? In that case, had she been honest, she could have added that line., error: It's my first Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie book for some reason. My only experience with Nigerian literature heretofore has beenThings Fall Apartwhich I've read multiple times and think exquisite.

Why can't it be about both, Ifem? Why can't it both be a love letter to colonialism as well as a book about the Indian Muslim character's isolation in a country not his? I mean, only because Ifem, a native African, was not aware of race and otherness before she stepped onto US soil, it doesn't mean an outsider wasn't persecuted within Africa. Furthermore, how is Ifem any different from the liberal Americans she lightly roasts in her blog? The ones who can crib unendingly about their country but cannot take even a slight slander of it from an outsider? Far be it from me to defendA Bend, it's been years since I read it, and I found it boring when I did, I found that exchange leaving a bad taste in my mouth, especially since a whole half of Americanah itself is given over to characters lusting after Europe and America.Second, why should slavery be a part of ordinary conversation, when Adichie propounds against it as a topic of novels? I honestly can't remember the mouthpiece she uses for this view, there are too many characters with only one opinion to contribute to the book. Anyway, it's something that happened in the 1960s and white guilt should not be absolved so quickly, yet writing about it is somehow selling out? I don't understand how saying this is any different than white people saying slavery is so done?Third, I found it ironic that one of the characters cries about how all the content in her book must be watered down for the non Black audience so that it's not all about race. Americanah is all about race (which is its strength, mostly), even when it has no reasonable cause to be. How could Adichie write this particular dialogue when it's untrue in the case of her own novel? Or is she immune because she's a literary big-shot? In that case, had she been honest, she could have added that line. --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"
